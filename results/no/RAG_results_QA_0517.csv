History and Comments: 1. The City of Jiao Zuo in the Henan Province was
the home of the Kingdom of Ye in the early Ming Dynasty (1368 – 1644 CE). The Kingdom Ye was often bullied by its neighbors. In one winter battle, Ye ’ s army was heavily outnumbered by the enemy and was chased deep into the mountains. The weather was bitterly cold, snow swirled through the air, and the provisions had run out. Despair began growing in the troops. Out of des-peration, a soldier dug up some roots from a snow - covered fi eld and gulped them down. To his surprise, the roots were sweet, juicy, and quite delicious. This news was greeted with cheers as it spread quickly through the army. The soldiers consumed the roots for several days, and they found their strength and vigor had returned. Many wounded soldiers had healed. Even the horses that had eaten the vines of the plant became much sturdier than before. The army rushed down from the mountain like lions, broke though the enemy ’ s encirclement, and recovered their lost lands. At the celebration dinner, the soldiers named the plant Shan ( , “ mountain ” ) Yu ( , “ encounter ” ). Somehow this later changed into Shao Yao because Yao means medicine and sounds more proper. Today, Jiao Zuo still produces the best quality Shan Yao in the world. This area was also famous for its Rehmannia Sheng Di Huang , Achyranthes Huai Niu Xi (Cyathula Chuan Niu Xi ) and Chrysanthemum Ju Hua production.",,"<說明、理由、分析>
 
根據提供的資料，Shan Yao 的故事記載在 Li Shi-Zhen 的 Materia Medica Compendium (Ben Cao Gang Mu) 中。


在這個故事中，當時有一位官員的年輕兒子因為吃了山藥的藤蔓而變得更加強壯。軍隊從山上衝下來像老虎一樣，突破敵人的包圍圈，並恢復失去的土地。在慶祝宴會上，士兵們將這種植物命名為 Shan ( 山 “mountain”) Yu Geng, “encounter”).


然而，這個故事並沒有提到植物最初被稱為什麼。


因此，我們無法確定山藥最初被軍隊命名的名字是什麼。

根據提供的文獻，Lung Qi Deficiency 是犬類中常見的氣質虛弱模式。根據《Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome A Disease of Canine and Feline Brain Aging.pdf》和《Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Pathophysiology Diagnosis and Treatment.pdf》，犬類Lung Qi Deficiency的典型臨床表現包括焦慮、夜間醒來、吠叫等行為問題。

根據《The location of the Small Intestine (SI) Channel and some of the most commonly used acupoints》中的描述，Small Intestine (SI) Channel 和一些常用的穴位在犬類中具有重要的臨床應用。

綜合上述信息，犬類Lung Qi Deficiency的典型臨床表現包括焦慮、夜間醒來、吠叫等行為問題，而Small Intestine (SI) Channel 和一些常用的穴位可能是犬類Lung Qi Deficiency的重要治療點。

在中醫理論中，母穴（Mother Acupoint）是指一系列的穴位，它們與特定的經脈（Meridian）有著特殊的關係。母穴的選擇是中醫治療的重要步驟，它們可以用來調節特定的經脈，從而達到治療的目的。

選擇母穴的原則是根據經脈的特點和病症的特點。例如，肺經（Lung Meridian）是身體的表層經脈，主要負責呼吸和免疫功能。選擇肺經的母穴時，需要考慮到肺經的特點和病症的特點。

肺經的母穴是肺經的起點，也是肺經的重要調節點。選擇肺經的母穴時，需要考慮到肺經的起點和終點，同時也需要考慮到病症的位置和特點。

1. 根據文獻，CCD是一種常見的犬類神經退行性疾病，會導致犬類的認知功能下降，包括記憶力、學習能力和判斷能力等。
2. 文獻中提到，CCD的症狀包括犬類在熟悉環境中迷路、失憶、學習能力下降等。
