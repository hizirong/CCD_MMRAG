History and Comments: 1. Ba Ji Tian was accidentally used and helped Zhuge
Liang ’ s army. Zhuge Liang (181 – 234 CE) was the most famous statesman and strategic general in Chinese history. He was the Chief Chancellor of the Shu Kingdom (known as Si - chuan today) during the Three Kingdoms period (220 – 280 CE). Zhuge Liang marched south to conquer the barbaric tribes and devised a clever plan to capture the tribal King. He commanded General Zhang Yi to lead one thousand soldiers to hide in a valley. The troops were to move in behind the barbarian tribes entering the valley and prevent their escape, trapping them. Zhuge Liang sent Zhang Yi to his task with a fi nal warning that “ Anyone who fails to execute the plan will be beheaded. ” When the troops failed their task, Zhang Yi was afraid that he and his subordinates would all be killed. Attempting to avert mortal punishment, he wrote a report explaining the reason for the failure. He explained that a 3 - day storm cut off pro-visions from the troops waiting in ambush in the valley. The cold and hungry soldiers ate the roots of the nearby grasses. One herb ( Ba Ji Tian ) with a white and purple root, tender texture, fl eshy appear-ance, and a sweet, slightly spicy taste was particu-larly popular among the men. It deterred hunger and kept them warm, so everyone enjoyed eating it. However, after eating the herb for several days, all the soldiers suffered from an embarrassing ailment. Every man had a long - lasting erection he could hardly bear, and he could not stop groaning. The groaning sound from the one thousand soldiers reverberated in the valley like a roaring wind, which scared away the enemy. Thus, the army won the battle but did not capture all the barbaric tribe members. When Zhuge Liang heard the story, he summarized the battle by writing: “ Ba Ji pointed to the sky, gave man ’ s power, and made the enemy run away. We all would enjoy having this problem. ” Ba Ji literally refers to a halberd, which is an ancient spearlike weapon. When the two characters are reversed to form “ Ji Ba , ” it becomes a Chinese slang term referring to a man ’ s penis. “ Tian ” literally means sky. Therefore the herb ’ s name “ Ba Ji Tian ” became a testament to the Chief Counselor ’ s sense of humor. Since that time, “ Ba Ji Tian ” has often been used in formulas that tonify the Kidney Yang .",Herbology_ocr.pdf,"根據題目描述，Ba Ji Tian是一種能夠幫助人體感到溫暖的藥物，並且曾經在歷史故事中被用於驅趕敵人。

A LU-9 B HT-7 C BL-13",A,"“Table 7.16 Application of Influential Points — LU-9: weakness of pulse, disorders of vessels.”",xie’s-veterinary-acupuncture.pdf,"根據參考資料，我們可以看到「Maihui point」是脈會穴的別名，位於肺俞穴（BL-13）的位置。

理由：
1. 參考資料中提到「脈會穴」的定位是在肺俞穴（BL-13）處。
2. 「Maihui point」被描述為脈會穴的別名，因此它的位置也應該與肺俞穴相同。

分析：
根據這些信息，我們可以得出結論：要刺激「Maihui point」，我們應該選擇肺俞穴（BL-13）。
