History and Comments: 1. Ba Ji Tian was accidentally used and helped Zhuge
Liang ’ s army. Zhuge Liang (181 – 234 CE) was the most famous statesman and strategic general in Chinese history. He was the Chief Chancellor of the Shu Kingdom (known as Si - chuan today) during the Three Kingdoms period (220 – 280 CE). Zhuge Liang marched south to conquer the barbaric tribes and devised a clever plan to capture the tribal King. He commanded General Zhang Yi to lead one thousand soldiers to hide in a valley. The troops were to move in behind the barbarian tribes entering the valley and prevent their escape, trapping them. Zhuge Liang sent Zhang Yi to his task with a fi nal warning that “ Anyone who fails to execute the plan will be beheaded. ” When the troops failed their task, Zhang Yi was afraid that he and his subordinates would all be killed. Attempting to avert mortal punishment, he wrote a report explaining the reason for the failure. He explained that a 3 - day storm cut off pro-visions from the troops waiting in ambush in the valley. The cold and hungry soldiers ate the roots of the nearby grasses. One herb ( Ba Ji Tian ) with a white and purple root, tender texture, fl eshy appear-ance, and a sweet, slightly spicy taste was particu-larly popular among the men. It deterred hunger and kept them warm, so everyone enjoyed eating it. However, after eating the herb for several days, all the soldiers suffered from an embarrassing ailment. Every man had a long - lasting erection he could hardly bear, and he could not stop groaning. The groaning sound from the one thousand soldiers reverberated in the valley like a roaring wind, which scared away the enemy. Thus, the army won the battle but did not capture all the barbaric tribe members. When Zhuge Liang heard the story, he summarized the battle by writing: “ Ba Ji pointed to the sky, gave man ’ s power, and made the enemy run away. We all would enjoy having this problem. ” Ba Ji literally refers to a halberd, which is an ancient spearlike weapon. When the two characters are reversed to form “ Ji Ba , ” it becomes a Chinese slang term referring to a man ’ s penis. “ Tian ” literally means sky. Therefore the herb ’ s name “ Ba Ji Tian ” became a testament to the Chief Counselor ’ s sense of humor. Since that time, “ Ba Ji Tian ” has often been used in formulas that tonify the Kidney Yang .",Herbology_ocr.pdf,"根據題目描述，Ba Ji Tian是一種能夠幫助人體感到溫暖的藥物，並且曾經在歷史故事中被用於驅趕敵人。

A) 有沒有最近嘔吐？這個問題主要關注於身體健康狀況，而不是認知功能。
B) 是不是迷路或混亂？這個問題直接針對犬的認知功能，可能與CCD有關。

根據提供的資料，沒有直接提到 Levothyroxine、Levetiracetam、Prednisolone 或 Atropine 這些藥物與 CCD 的治療關係。然而，我們可以看到有一個段落提到了一種名為 Bambusa Tian Zhu Huang（Bamboo Resin）的中藥，它的主作用是「transform Heat-Phlegm and stop cough, and b) stop Epilepsy」。

但是，這些藥物與題目中的選項無關。因此，我們需要根據常識和臨床經驗進行推斷。

在臨床實踐中，犬認知功能障礙綜合症（CCD）的治療方法多種多樣，包括中藥、西藥等。但是，並沒有直接證據表明 Levothyroxine、Levetiracetam、Prednisolone 或 Atropine 這些藥物能夠改善 CCD 的神經興奮和注意力障礙。

因此，我們需要根據臨床經驗進行推斷。根據我的知識，中藥 Bambusa Tian Zhu Huang（Bamboo Resin）可能有助於改善神經系統的功能，包括神經興奮和注意力障礙。但是，這並不是題目中的選項。

因此，我們需要選擇一個最合理的答案。根據我的知識和臨床經驗，我們可以推斷出 Levetiracetam 可能有助於改善神經系統的功能，包括神經興奮和注意力障礙。

理由：
1. Levetiracetam 是一種抗癲癇藥物，它可能有助於改善神經系統的功能。
2. 中藥 Bambusa Tian Zhu Huang（Bamboo Resin）可能有助於改善神經系統的功能，但它並不是題目中的選項。

題目詢問的是MRI微出血檢測的最佳序列順序。根據提供的文獻，對於犬隻的認知功能障礙綜合症（CCD），MRI特徵的文獻相較於阿茲海默病（AD）而言較為稀缺。

理由：
根據文獻中提到的MRI特徵，對於AD患者，腦部影像可能正常或顯示腦萎縮、室腔擴大和中線時脈導區的損傷。然而，這些資訊並未直接指出犬隻CCD的最佳MRI序列順序。

分析：

A) Walking against the wall B) Not recognizing acquaintances C) Change of feces color D) Lost card furniture,C,Table 1 lists abnormal behaviours; stool-colour change is not included.,‎Under diagnosis of canine cognitive dysfunction.pdf,"首先，我們需要根據題目整理參考資訊。根據提供的資料，Salvin Behavior Scale是一種評估犬類動物行為的工具，旨在識別高風險行為。

接下來，我們可以分析每個選項：

A) Walking against the wall：這是 Salvin Behavior Scale 中的一個高風險行為，因為它可能表明犬類動物有認知功能障礙（Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome）。

B) Not recognizing acquaintances：同樣，這也是 Salvin Behavior Scale 中的一個高風險行為，因為它可能表明犬類動物的認知功能受損。

D) Lost card furniture King Emperor Jun 君藥 君药：這似乎與題目無關，且不清楚何謂“Lost card furniture”。

C) Change of feces color：雖然這可能是某些疾病的跡象，但它並不是 Salvin Behavior Scale 中的一個高風險行為。

綜合以上分析，我們可以得出以下結論：

理由：
1. 根據提供的資料，Salvin Behavior Scale 是一種評估犬類動物行為的工具。
2. 行為 A) Walking against the wall 和 B) Not recognizing acquaintances 都是 Salvin Behavior Scale 中的一個高風險行為。
3. 選項 C) Change of feces color 不是 Salvin Behavior Scale 中的一個高風險行為。
