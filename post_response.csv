失智的狗狗，如果晚上四處走，不懂自己睡，是否買輪椅給牠晚上用，讓牠累就直接睡比較好？但我看到長期用手腳的位置會紅呢，應該怎樣比較好？（現在都是抱牠入睡，但凌晨牠自己起身我也不知道呢）請指教。,"輪椅不能坐太久，最多半小時

"關於犬失智有問題想請益
上禮拜開始發現家中小狗（11歲）開始對於指令失去反應，聯想到前陣子他開始偶爾會躲在角落，有時候好像也會不認得我姊姊，懷疑他開始有失智的情形。
1.已有預約台大神經科醫師診察，但要等一個多月，想詢問大台北地區有其他專科醫師有專長看失智可以推薦嗎？
2. 另外，他目前除上述之外，精神活力食慾等都很正常，在犬認知障礙評估表上的分數也不算高（33分），這樣看專科醫生的意義大嗎？（因為爬文發現失智是屬於排除是診斷，需要靠症狀的察覺去確診）
3.爬文發現失智可以使用蘇活莎美、腦活素、中鏈油，請問這些都算是保健食品嗎？還是藥品？
在還沒看過醫生前，我可以先給狗狗使用嗎？
4.想請問如果做高壓氧大家使用的頻率為何？
大家的經驗裡，改善的情況又是如何？
爬文發現失智可能會惡化的很快，而且最後會癱瘓、危及性命，我現在有點驚慌，先謝謝各位的幫助🙏🙏",中獸醫去年開始推廣失智的檢驗系統跟調養中藥,,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/6DkLRFqSQQBN7G3M/,,3,,,,,,,,,,

去年一度也是發現家中老狗卡在角落哀嚎，我是用零食引誘他進出那角落+開始藏寶遊戲訓練，同時吃腦活素，有改善。",,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/6DkLRFqSQQBN7G3M/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"家中狗狗16歲了，
去年底開始出現失智的症狀後來也被診斷，
最近這2個月和家人都沒有睡好覺，
狗狗半夜都會起來走路、繞圈圈、跌倒站不起或是卡住出不來就會尖叫，
原本因為擔心狗狗年紀大了，
身體無法負荷鎮定安眠的藥物，
所以都是以保健食品為主，
後來醫師有開康格憶、安神沛，
但是沒有顯著改善…
也已經影響到家人健康
甚至開車上下班途中打瞌睡，差點撞上前車…
約一週前請醫師開了鎮定安眠的藥
醫師也說因為考量狗狗心臟和肝臟不好
所以劑量非常輕微，
慢慢視狗狗的情況調整藥物
可是狗狗吃完藥後是呈現身體無法動彈 
然後感覺好像很害怕無法控制自己的身體
會一直掙扎跟尖叫
但是藥物的作用會讓他無法動
狗狗緊張到一直喘氣、防護墊上都是他的口水
看了真的很心疼…
詢問醫師表示仍須再調整藥物
想請教有其他好的照護建議嗎？

"Decided to let my dog with dementia go
He is scheduled to be euthanized (in-home) this coming Sunday.

I just joined this sub so I apologize if this is not the place to post this.  My 16.5 year old male Jack Russell Terrier (Dexter) has progressive dementia or  Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD) and was diagnosed about a year and half ago.  Symptoms have progressed somewhat slowly  over the course of the year and a half but if I compare to how he is today versus just say, 2 months ago, things are noticeably different compared to when he was first diagnosed and 3 months after.Overall, over the course of the last 8 to 12 months, I managed an average of around 4 to 6 hours of sleep a night as my dog would wake and pace in circles.  Currently, he has all of the classic symptoms including urinating frequently (every 10 to 15 minutes if not taken out) indoors and when defecating indoors or outdoors, he would fall over on himself due to his weak legs.  There's two options during his daily life and that is either to sleep or when he's awake, he would pace in circles.  He also has signs of staring into space or getting ""stuck"" by simple things like a chair leg.  It takes me anywhere from 1 hour to 3 hours every night to get him to lay in his bed and stay there. But that doesn't guarantee he will remain there enough for me to get a somewhat good night sleep.

The most difficult part is at times, he will seem like himself.  He will seem like he's aware and he will do his little happy jog for a few paces when he smells his treat. Like today, I gave him a kiss and he kissed me right back. He has not done this in close to a year.  And this was right after I finalized the time with the vet.  It's so heartbreaking.  Is it a sign?  Ugh.  But I know the CCD has either fully consumed him or is very close and I have been struggling - and currently feeling an intense and enormous amount of guilt that I may be putting him to sleep too soon or that I may be doing this because I have to take him out to pee every 10 minutes or have to hold him up so he can perform #2 in at 3am, or know that I have to clean his entire cage and bath him after coming back from work or dinner because he's soiled himself by being left alone for just 3 to 4 hours.

I know that this is my decision but that doesn't make it any better.  Has anyone else gone through this?  I'm finding myself ( a grown 44-year old man) breaking down in tears in the middle of the day, in the shower, and even while working out thinking about all of this.  With the euthanization coming Sunday, I am absolutely dreading the weekend.  I've taken so many online ""quality of life"" assessments but I come out more confused and guilty as ever - even though the majority indicate it is time.

I'm at the point where I'm starting to think about ""well, if this problem with Dexter didn't exist, would I still euthanize him"" and I do this with every ""issue"" to see if I'm being some kind of selfish a-hole.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is.  To vent?  To ask for help?  To be reassured?  No idea.  This is my first pet and the first death of anything that's so close to me about to pass away.",,,https://reddit.com/r/DogCare/comments/zgbvjz/decided_to_let_my_dog_with_dementia_go/,7,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I had a Rottweiler who was the kindest, most loving being I’ve ever met. We rescued her at an older age and gave her the best life. She was spoiled and I told her every day I was thankful she chose us. Being older, she developed tumors a few months after adopting her. Had one round of removals but we knew it could come back. It did. 

The mass was very large and the surgery was going to be costly and she might not wake back up from it, so we decided to manage her pain and continue to give her love. Had to adjust our schedules, but it was worth it. One morning her mass split open. It was awful. We rushed to the vet and had to make the impossible decision that it was her time. I was devastated. 

The vet said one thing that I hope will help you: they will NEVER euthanize an animal if they can see the animal is not ready to go. They will never choose to end their life early, and that brought some small comfort. 

Enjoy the time you have, celebrate your dog while you can, and be there with them if you are able. You’ll be a mess and that’s very expected. Take your time to grieve.

,"I am going through the same exact thing with my 15 year old. We have him on medicine that has helped with his dementia for a few months, but the last few weeks he seems to be sliding further into it. Our vet taught us how to make him defecate, get a finger glove with some Vaseline and just stick it in slowly until he pushes it out. We do this every day especially if we have to leave the house. The diapers have helped a lot too. Otherwise, everything else has been about the same as your situation. My fiancé just broke down crying today too. I don’t want to let him go, but if he keeps freaking out like this nonstop all through the night I don’t think I’m doing him any favors by holding on, as much as I love him.

After I got bit a couple times I knew I couldn't be sure it wouldn't be a kid next. Would have been cruel to cage him 24 hrs a day, but I felt so horrible when I took him to the vet.

We had to put down our nearly 14 year old pitbull last year as his health was steadily deteriorating and he could barely stand anymore. We had him since he was eight weeks old. It was so hard. We also chose in-home euthanasia as well, and it was the best decision we could have made. The vet that came over made it such a peaceful and loving experience. We petted him and told him that we loved him right until the end. If I could use that same ending for myself when the time comes, I would. 

The morning of the euthanasia, we did as many things that he loved that he was still able to participate in. We put him in a wagon and took him to the park so he could smell some park smells. We put them on a blanket outside lay in the sun & get pets. We played a movie with lots of dogs for him to bark at with impunity if he felt like it (he didn’t). We offered him lots of naughty treats, like hamburger, grapes, and chocolate. His last day is lawless and it was beautiful. Each day afterward gets a little easier. Rest assured that you’re doing the right thing by your little buddy and it won’t be easy, but you will be OK. He knows he’s deeply loved.

"Question about diaper use
Hi,

I have a 16 year old female spayed dog who is starting to become incontinent and senile. She started peeing in the house about 4 months ago, but the accidents are becoming more frequent. She is already on Proin, but I'm finding that she sometimes just pees in the house. Not like a subconscious dribble in her sleep, but rather, a full on puddle of pee in the house, without warning. It seems intentional to me, and likely more cognitive/behavioral vs weak bladder muscles

I'm going to take her to the vet soon to rule out any health concerns, and maybe get her Anipryl for her CCD.  But in the mean time, I am just starting, as of today, to put her in a diaper. This is mainly for when I'm at work and can't let her go outside. When I'm home from work, she will not be in a diaper, and I try to walk her multiple times.

The diaper thing is brand new to me. If I come home from work and find that she has soiled her diaper, should I immediately bathe her? I'm just concerned about urine scalding/UTIs/rashes if she has to be in a wet diaper for a couple hours before I get home etc. Any advice is appreciated. 

Thank you!",,,https://reddit.com/r/DogCare/comments/163upxf/question_about_diaper_use/,,8,,,,,,,,,,

,"I have had two neutered male dogs in diapers due to incontinence once they were older.  One of the dogs had a very severe reaction to Proin after two doses so that was not an option and I refused to try it on my other dog after that experience.  So diapers was the only option for us.

I found it to be easiest to have multiple diapers so they could be changed frequently and if I wasn’t able to do a load of laundry that day, I still had enough clean.  I found reasonably priced ones on Amazon in 3 packs and ended up with 9 total diapers for each dog. (They were different sizes).  I used Lysol Laundry Sanitizer (in the detergent aisle) in addition to my normal detergent when washing them.

You do want to clean the dog if it’s urinated and sat in the diaper to prevent urine burn.  I didn’t need to give my dogs baths daily or even weekly  necessarily, but I did clean the area with gentle or pet soap and water daily (sometimes multiple times a day depending) and in between baths.  I was fortunate to be able to take mine out on my lunch break so he was not sitting for too long of a period of time but if you have to wait your whole shift I still think she would be ok without having an issue being that you’d clean her off when you got home and took her out.

My dogs never previously had issues with UTI’s but they did get them on and off as they got older once they were in the diapers and it was really obvious as the diapers would suddenly smell really bad.  If you notice a foul smell suddenly, definitely have them assessed by the vet as they probably have a uti.  I’ll never know if they were caused from the diapers, them getting older or their other health issues but they weren’t constant and were easily treated.

Honestly once I got the hang of using the diapers they weren’t any problem at all to deal with.  They’re much better than the alternative of having a leaky bladder in the house or on the furniture and only took a little adjusting to get used to for me.  The dogs never seemed to care to wear them either.  

Good luck to you.  It’s can be so hard once they get older but she is lucky to have you.",,https://reddit.com/r/DogCare/comments/163upxf/question_about_diaper_use/#k1tgcvu,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Will adding vegies to senior dogs diet help or hinder constipation?
2mths ago my aunt's 14yr old dog had his anal glands expressed due to constipation. 
He now does very firm stools but is starting to have some bowel incontinence, not quite getting outside when he needs to (he is on his way to dementia).

I've read up about vegies being good to add fibre to their diet and help pass stools, but have also seen advice saying too much fibre will soften his stools too much (eg diarrhoea, which with bowel incontinence would not be ideal!). Also is one large meal s day okay or would morning and evening  smaller meals be best?

His diet is currently:
-one portion of raw mince (unsure of brand, I'm just housesitting)
-some tablespoons of Lyka
-some kibble, whatever brand (optimum ATM)

It is one big meal at night. Should I make it two feeds, and would a handful of steamed veggies each feed help or hinder his digestion?

"Need advice!! behavior changes in my senior dog
Hello all. My dog is currently about 10-11 years old. He's a rhodesian ridgeback, and we've had him for 10 years. Over the last few months, we've noticed some major behavior changes, and I'm super worried about him.

For context, l'm 17 currently living with my dad.
My parents separated earlier this year, and my mom moved out about 6 months ago. She was my dog's favorite, and she was the one who primarily fed him, gave him water, etc. Since then, I have filled in that role. My dog hasn't seemed to exhibit any signs of major depression, but all of these behavioral changes started after she moved out.

1. Increased appetite (but decreased interest in his own food)—My dog has always begged for food (it was never really trained out of him), but over the last few months, it has gotten so much worse. He will whine and whine at us until our plates are fully put away in the dishwasher. We rarely give in, so I don't think this is a learned behavior. It only started getting bad in the last few months. At the same time, though, he refuses to eat his own kibble that we give him. He will avoid it like the plague, sometimes eating the kibble that we give to our other dog instead. This has caused major issues for us and I'm not sure if it's any cause for concern, or if he's just being a dog that doesn't know any better.

2. Heavy panting-along with the begging has come heavy, and I mean *heavy* panting. He breathes like he's never taken a sip of water before, it's really concerning. This only happens when we're eating meals in front of him, though.

3. Restlessness at night-self explanatory. He will spend hours pacing around at night downstairs, whining at the door, waking us up in the middle of the night to go outside. He usually sleeps in my parents room. He never used to do this before my mom moved out, he would always sleep through the night.

4. Increased thirst-also self explanatory. My boy is THIRSTY lol

5. General increased anxiety-this is also especially at night. I just notice more self soothing behaviors. Liplicking, averting his gaze, etc. He's also more often posted up in our laundry room, which I know is one of his comfort spots. His main comfort spot was my mom's closet before she left, but he doesn't really go in there anymore.

Could this all be related to my mom moving out? I thought he was adjusting well but maybe he's not. I'm leaving for summer job soon and then moving for school, and I'm worried about how that'll affect him if this is the case. I'm also worried about Cushings and possible dementia. At what point do I bring him to the vet? This is my childhood dog and I love him very deeply.

"Best Tools/Systems/Routines for Accidents?
My elderly dog has gotten to the point where he's pretty much fully un-housebroken now-- it started with #2 about a year ago, and as of the last month or two, now #1 as well. It's presumably dementia/neuro related per the vet and trainers. It's not perfect but manageable when the weather's moderate, which is most of the time, as I keep him (and his food/water/a mat) on the covered porch and just accept that there will be accidents out there. When it's too hot or cold, however, what can I do when I have to leave him inside?   
\-He's not trained to stay in his crate for long stretches (several hours)

\-He's extremely furry, so diapers aren't a good option

\-He has never peed on a rug/ seems to always go in the hard floor hallway/kitchen...so just cover that entire area in puppy pads all the time? 

Is there any other option I'm not thinking of?  (Also, FWIW, I'm not at the place of thinking of end of life yet, since according to the vet he doesn't seem to be in pain and he still has some good days where he enjoys walks/ always wants snacks and pets)",,,https://reddit.com/r/DogCare/comments/17vgbqu/best_toolssystemsroutines_for_accidents/,,13,,,,,,,,,,

"what items do dogs need?
Got a great aunt moving in with me with her two dogs in 2 weeks and I'm not sure what the dogs need because I've never had one before. I've already picked some treats up for them and she already has bowls for them and some other stuff like beds but she's in her 80's with dementia so it will be up to me and my sis to care for them mostly like walking them, taking them to the groomers or vets.

I plan to buy toys soon but I'm not sure what toys are best? I was looking at like soft toys today from pets at home but thought they might get destroyed easily?

One dog is a west highland white terrier male 3 years old and the other is a German shepherd lurcher mix around 5-7 years old.

I'd appreciate any information on what I need to get for them.

So far on the list is

New Collars, 
Leashes,
Toys,
New Bowls If needed (they have some already),
Bed for one dog If needed right now she prefers sleeping with my aunt on the bed and
Poop Bags, grooming supplies, natural dried chews, nail clippers. Harness, big lead

We're making the back garden safe for them and there is a dog park down the road.

Update: just been out and my god there was so many toys to choose from. I got them some chews, toys and travel bowls for the 5 hour journey home. I got them a mixture of toys so some soft and some hard I wasn't sure what they preferred. Also got poop bags almost forgot those. Tried finding a brush but the options they had out weren't very good. Got them this bone with marrow inside which my aunt said her dogs love.

I will be getting the other stuff listed soon. Had a look at harnesses, long leads and collars but I wasn't sure what size to get so I'll get them when they're here when I can measure them and I'm not sure what lead my aunt has so I'll check that out too.

,"You and your sis sound like good people taking in your great aunt and her dogs like this :) 

I'm not sure what your aunt already has, but a brush might be helpful if there isn't one already. And as far as toys go, most dogs seem to have a preference for what style of toy (if any) they prefer. Some love soft plushies, some love kongs or other hard toys, others just want a ball. Stuffed toys in general won't last super long, although it also depends on the dogs play style and the durability/build of the toy.

Also, make sure you brush up on what is poisonous to a dog (you can find posters and infographics online). Some can be unexpected. For example, grapes and raisins can be toxic. Xylitol can be deadly and is found in many things like mints, toothpaste, and gum. Good to be aware of what to keep an eye out for, either in your back garden or what may drop on your kitchen floor.

Chews. Toys are for interactive play NOT for shredding. Toys are ropes, balls, stuffed animals, etc. that you play fetch or tug with together. Chews are edible and for gnawing/licking/chewing on. Stuffed Kongs, [bully sticks](www.bestbullysticks.com), nohide/cheeky rolls (I avoid rawhide and anything that is just skin like ears; no hard teeth-breaking bones or antlers either).

,"In addition to your list I'd maybe add a long lead (10-15m). It will be helpful to give them some almost-liberty on forest/field/trail walks while training them to come back to you when you call them.

For the toys, all depends on what they already have and like. Hard chew toys, plushies, rope toys, balls.... Some destroy plushies/rope in seconds, some are much softer with their plushies/rope and do not tear them to pieces event months later.

Talking of chews in addition to the treat you already got, for sure get them single ingredient natural dried chews like yak cheese, cod skin, dried tripe, pig snout, beef tendons, duck wings, half split antlers, hooves ..... Avoid those ""fake white bones"" (I don't remember the word in English rn) or stuff with a ingredient list long as an arm.  Chews will help keep them occupied when home and clean teeth.

Items that aren't in the necessary bracket but imo should be, are lickimats, toppl, wobble balls, slowfeeders ect. Basically occupations games for the dog to get to their food. Makes them much more tired than ""just eating out of a boring bowl"".

,"This happened to us a couple months before our dog passed. It will take some communication and patience with your pet, and what you're asking is not easy but possible.


Similar to your situation, it started with her hind limbs weakening, and instead of squatting down, she would just pee all over her legs. She was a stubborn one, so all I could do was just hold her (as you would if you were about to lift her up, and let her know I was ready to catch her weight if she stumbled) while she stood over her usual peeing spot and let her do her thing. At this time, she wasn't the cleanest dog but hey, that's life. 


Gradually as her mobility faded, we built a new routine and she became comfortable with being held while peeing. At that point, she knew to wait until she was lowered above her spot, and things got easier. She would bark to let us know when she needed to pee (she did require round the clock care at this point). That eventually extended to pooing, except that often took longer, and sometimes required a bit of sitting with her on our laps at the front steps. I think both you and him will know when he's ready to do that.


On top of cleanliness, you also need to watch out for matted hair and bed sores, signs of mental/neurological stress, physical pain from his underlying conditions (e.g. arthritis), change in appetite, among other things. Give him lots of brushes and massages. Change his position for him regularly if he can, and read his signals to see if he's happy and comfortable.


I have to agree with everyone here though, this is the beginning of the end. This is palliative care. Make plans for the final goodbye now because it may come sooner than you think. I know you're a good dog parent, and you're trying, but honestly, you may both be better off to let him go now because it's not always easy for the dog (and you) to establish a new routine.

,"I feel you! My dogs are pretty young but it's very hot here too and we just had a bit of a rainy season. I've been trying to find ways to keep them from going out of their minds without as much outdoor time as they prefer. 

I try to turn meals into games. For our small dog who eats a weight management kibble, I put his meals into a wobble kong toy. He loves it. I sometimes also twist and roll the kibble into a towel for him, so he has to find it and snuffle it out. We play ""find it"" with kibble or treats, where I either toss one into grass for him to find or hide a few in tricky spots for him inside (or a mix of tricky and not so tricky). 

For the puppy, the towel thing is a little tougher because she's such a big oaf. Also she eats a TON, too much for one interactive toy, so when I'm gamifying her meals it's some combo of training, a rolling ball that dispenses the kibble, a slow-feeder bowl, and ""find it"" - with her I drop or hide food all over the living room for her to find rather than just a few pieces. I have to make sure the little guy can't interrupt the game because he will sneakily join in, and he'll find anything she's missed if I don't check. 

Both dogs enjoy chewing antlers, yak chews, bones, etc. They also love berries, ice cubes, and bits of dog-friendly vegetables like carrots and green beans as treats - I'm not sure if any of those fit your dog's diet. 

I realize all of these ideas rely on the dogs being able to eat kibble/ chew hard things. If your dog needs soft foods or has other tricky requirements, maybe putting something like pumpkin onto a lick mat could be stimulating, or freezing homemade broth in something for him to lick. You could use a little bowl of wet food for ""find it."" If you're doing any training for enrichment, I've heard of people using licks of a block of frozen broth as a reward. I can't remember what they described, essentially something like freezing a broth popsicle that's easy to hold. (Obviously, dog-safe broth with no onion or garlic.)

The puppy loves peanut butter kongs but I imagine pb is not specialized diet friendly. I was surprised to learn about the variety of things people put in them. Greek yogurt, pumpkin, cheese, treats... Maybe you can come up with something that fits your dog's special diet. If his teeth are ok you can freeze it to make it last longer.

This might sound dumb but another thing I've been doing with my dogs sometimes is taking them on what I call a scent adventure. I take them somewhere and just let them sniff. The name is partially about the mindset for me. It doesn't have to be big. A trip to pick up takeout can mean a scent adventure in the parking lot. Other times it's a little more intentional, ex the other day I took them to a random empty playground and put the younger pup on a long leash to explore with her nose.",,https://reddit.com/r/DogCare/comments/nylxhn/good_enrichment_for_an_elderly_dog_who_struggles/#h1mptll,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Proactively Preventing CCD
Hello,

My 15ish year old pup passed away in July from presumably cancer (we chose not to do further diagnostics because he was on everything he could be) but struggled with canine cognitive decline for about 2 years prior. Thankfully, Selegiline made a huge impact and kept him relatively stable for much of those 2 years. A lot of vets didn’t recommend it for some reason but it was night and day improvement. When he couldn’t take it anymore, he spiraled quickly. I don’t think he knew who me and my husband were the last week or two. It was really hard. I had him for almost 13 years.

Anyway, we adopted a new pup about a week later to help prevent me spiraling honestly. She’s been great. Tiny 4.5 lb chihuahua. She’s only about 11 months old. I’m just wondering if there are foods or supplements that might be helpful now to help keep her brain as healthy as possible as long as possible. I’d like to avoid going through CCD with a dog again if possible. It was heartbreaking.

Any tips? She is currently on Zignature Small Bites Lamb Formula dry food and I use a bit of canned food (also Zignature) of different flavors to help her eat the dry food. No supplements. Just monthly flea/heartworm/tick prevention otherwise.

Thanks for your time!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1fz3sat/proactively_preventing_ccd/,,18,,,,,,,,,,

"CCD and aggression... any connection to Simparica?
My family and I had to put down our 7 1/2 year old mixed breed rescue dog because of increasingly common aggression incidents a few years ago, and the vet was never able to figure out what was causing it. It started with resource guarding food but only with a few members of the family and didn't get much worse than just small growls. Then he had a few isolated incidents of getting aggressive with visitors that he knew well and he had greeted happily at the door, which we thought for a while had something to do with eyesight, because he seemed to just not recognize them all of a sudden. It got worse over time despite our best attempts at training, and he eventually bit me, even though I had been the one person he had never shown even slight aggression towards, and my mom in two separate incidents.

For a time we questioned if it had anything to do with the medicine Simparica, because it got worse when he started taking it and got better for a while after we stopped giving it to him. But the vet, throughout blood tests and an MRI, found no evidence of any other issues. I just came across an article on Canine cognitive dysfunction, which I had never heard of, and got this sinking feeling in my stomach because the aggression issues, heightened anxiety, sudden inability to recognize familiar people, vision impairment, lethargy, etc all sounds eerily like the changes we saw in him.

I'm not quite sure what I'm asking exactly, I just want desperately to finally have some sort of answer on what happened to my best friend. Does it seem possible/likely that this is what he was experiencing? Are there any cases anyone has seen of relation between CCD and Simparica?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1fc6909/ccd_and_aggression_any_connection_to_simparica/,,19,,,,,,,,,,

"Dog with CCD suddenly much worse
My dog has been battling CCD for awhile - the sundowners, pacing, getting stuck under stuff, lower appetite. She’s seen improvement on Senilife and was recently started on Librela injections for her pain, which has improved her arthritis and was helping some of her sleep symptoms. Usually if she doesn’t get enough sleep at night, she catches up during the day. 

However, we had a vet visit to discuss some plans and got her second Librela injection on Wednesday. For two nights, she slept better than she has in months. Then on Saturday, she started pacing. And did not stop. She won’t sleep, day or night, until she is fully exhausted. She ended up having a cluster of 6+ focal seizures over the course of 2 days (she has had them before but not since beginning Gabapentin), but did not stop pacing. We took her to the ER vet and they treated her for epilepsy and started her on Keppra.

Now we’re home, she’s back to pacing after sleeping off her ER meds! We thought maybe the pacing could have been a pre/post-ictal symptom, but she has been seizure free since our ER visit and still unable to stop. She also seems a lot more disoriented and uncomfortable with me, as well as sort of unsure about who we are (the way she was before we began Senilife), when just three days ago she was happy to cuddle up and nap. 

Of course we are trying to get in to see our regular vet, but I am curious if anyone has witnessed this rapid of a backslide before? Given that Librela has been the only change, I am curious, but she didn’t have any reactions to her first injection so I am open to the idea it might be a coincidence.

 Species:

• Age: ~12

• Sex/Neuter status: Female spayed

• Breed: Pug

• Body weight: 15 pounds

• History: CCD, Arthritis, focal seizures. On Gabapentin, Senilife supplements, Librela, and just started Keppra. 

• Clinical signs: Pacing, increased confusion. 

• Duration: 3 days

• Your general location: Midwest USA",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1avhyn9/dog_with_ccd_suddenly_much_worse/,,21,,,,,,,,,,

,"It sounds like you’re doing a great job trying to help your pup as much as you can. CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) can be a frustratingly difficult constellation of symptoms to manage and there’s no one treatment answer. Unfortunately, brain disease (tumor, inflammation, fluid accumulation, etc.) can look similar to CCD and without an MRI, it’s impossible to differentiate. In an ideal world, we’d know for sure what we’re treating, but it’s often not the case in veterinary medicine. CCD can suddenly get worse, but when more neurological symptoms develop as I’m treating something that shouldn’t change quickly, I worry about the possibility I’m not treating the right thing. Unfortunately, I’d be worried about a progressing brain tumor or multiple strokes causing what you’re seeing and she may have had it all along and CCD was a reasonable, but incorrect, assumption or another problem is developing in addition to the CCD.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1avhyn9/dog_with_ccd_suddenly_much_worse/#kre3vch,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can't even find a veterinarian who has any knowledge of it whatsoever in my small town of Apache Junction. Does someone know what type of doctor I would see and recommend a doctor who will treat it or at least consider it.

Current doctor doesn't have a clue just says it's a tumor his blood work comes up fine. His behavior is similar to other dogs where people have taken videos online. Every night is extremely difficult during the days a little bit better but I believe this occurred over many years.

"CCD selegiline
Hello,

My dog's been prescribed selegiline 2.5mg for his dementia. He's been taking it for a few days and it seems that it's making his symptoms worse: more restless, walking in circles and new one's like moaning. This was given to us by a neurologist, the side effects weren't discussed, so I assumed the medicine either helps him or nothing changes.

I took my dog to the vet clinic yesterday and the internist said to discontinue the selegiline and prescribed 50mg of Gabapentin twice a day (my dog is 16 and weighs 3kg) to calm him down.

I know that the neurologist is at the clinic on Tuesday so I will call him. In the meantime should Selegiline be stopped abruptly instead of maybe lowering the dose? I'd like to help my dog's dementia if it's possible. Are his side effects normal and would go away or are they serious? I've read about the serotonin syndrome, maybe that's what he was experiencing.

"CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction)
CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction)

Good afternoon everyone,
I’m going to try and make this short and sweet.
My 16 yo mini-Doxy (dachshund) has CCD (essentially doggy dementia).This has caused him to have Day-Night reversal where he is up all night wandering the house whining and crying. He is physically very healthy and has a healthy appetite/thirst. During the early afternoons he is his normal goofy happy go lucky self but at night he changes and becomes frantic and inconsolable.  His vet has tried three different med combos (currently on Gabepentin and Phenobarbital 2x a day) and nothing seems to help. It’s been about four months and I haven’t slept more than 3 hours a night in about two months. My fiancé and I love him more than anything but I am not so sure how much more I can take. I’ve tried a thunder shirt, cuddling, cbd. He normally sleeps with us and has for years but now doesn’t seem to want too. I used to be able to pick him up and he would calm down but now that won’t even help. I’ve tried to talk to the vet about helping him cross the rainbow bridge but he seems insistent on trying different drugs. I’m ok with more options but I also don’t want him to live in a drug fueled haze. The past week or so I’ve payed with him on the living room floor just petting him while he whines. I don’t know what else to do and I’m so tired. Has anyone dealt with this? Does anyone have advice?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/obpkh3/ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction/,,27,,,,,,,,,,

,"Vet here. I'm so sorry that you are dealing with this in the home. It puts a strain on that bond we have with our pet. You love them but the constant whining and anxiety that he is suffering from at night keeps everybody up in the house. So, a lot of pet owners consider euthanizing for that exact reason. You are not alone in feeling that way nor are you a horrible pet owner. 

Second, as far as therapy there are a lot of other things that can be tried. Ask your veterinarian for guidance here. 

Just like in humans we are not looking for a cure we are just looking for something that can help with the symptoms. Sometimes that involves SSRIs sometimes that involves selegeline, sometimes that involves Solliquin supplement or Purina Pro Plans Bright Minds diet  or Hill's B/D diet. All of these things can reduce the symptoms and their severity, but obviously we can't cure this disease. We still don't even quite understand what causes it, as there isn't any evidence of plaques developing in the brain like there is in humans with Alzheimer's.

Things that help with humans that may help pets: getting a ""companion"" like those stuffies with mama dog's heartbeat in them can make him feel like he isn't alone, keeping the night time routine EXACTLY the same with little deviation. Keeping him in his ""own little den"" of the house for his safety and your sanity just before his anxiety starts up.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/obpkh3/ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction/#h3ptnph,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Making a pet with canine cognitive dysfunction more comfortable?
Hello, vets! We have a vet appointment this evening, but I wanted to source some additional info here.

My senior Frenchie presumably has a brain tumor (seizures began in April, blood test did not indicate something wrong with liver or kidneys, we elected not to do an MRI b/c anesthesia could be risky and our little guy really hates the vet - he's also 10.75 yrs old). We've been successfully managing his seizures with meds for the last 8 months. Recently, he's begun to exhibit signs of canine cognitive dysfunction (doggy dementia). He is pacing at night a for a few hours, forgetting his house training, becoming less responsive to his name, sometimes stares at nothing or will hand out in a corner facing the wall for a few moments). He does not seem scared and he has not become aggressive. He just a seems a little depressed and confused sometimes. 

He loves kisses, cuddles, his food and treats, his little treat dispensing puzzle game and of course napping on every surface, especially his bed. He's definitely not as happy or active as he was before, but we are trying to be really thoughtful about his quality of life and we believe we bring each other  a lot of joy still. 

I know CCD isn't curable, but what have you all found helpful in making dogs more comfortable? I was thinking of asking the vet about medications like Senilife, but he is already on many medications for the seizures (Keppra, phenobarbital, zonisamide, and sometimes clorazepate if he clusters). Sometimes if he is pacing extra at night, we give him a couple droppers of Medterra CBD oil for dogs. 

Right now, we are just being more patient with him, trying to stimulate his mind with his puzzle games, taking him outside in his stroller when it isn't frigid, and not changing up his environment a lot. 

Thanks, all.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/zmpqlk/making_a_pet_with_canine_cognitive_dysfunction/,,28,,,,,,,,,,

"Senior dog with cognitive dysfunction/dementia causing extreme anxiety. Ways to soothe/sedate?
Our 13 year old rescue mutt has been in gradual cognitive decline and is experiencing major anxiety/panic as a result (vet has ruled out other causes of the behavior.)

It has reached the point that he is spending more time freaked out than not, so we made the tough decision that it’s time to say goodbye and we have an appointment for that on Friday. 

In the meantime, I’m desperately looking for any suggestions for ways to calm and soothe him. Over the past several months we (with our vet) have tried Benadryl, trazodone, gabapentin, assorted dietary changes and supplements, CBD, thunder shirt, increased exercise and stimulation, and nothing has made the slightest impact. Even at crazy high doses, none of the sedative meds we have tried have made him at all sleepy or calmed him down at all.

When he’s in panic mode, he paces non-stop, pants super heavily, bats with his paw at anyone and anything in reach, tries to climb on top of us but even when being actively held or petted or cuddled he can’t stay still. Ears as far back as they will go, tail tucked under. He’s just terrified, and nothing I do seems to calm him at all. 

[EDIT to add: we have also tried the plug-in calming hormone diffuser thing and the similar collar, used for several months and never had any apparent effect. Have also tried playing an assortment of “calming music for dogs” stations, etc. I’m telling y’all, there is nothing I won’t try at this point!]

I know it’s time to say goodbye, I’m just trying to find ways to help soothe him in the meantime until our appointment.

"Senior dog with, back end weakness, fecal incontinence and Canine Cognitive Dysfunction
Hi vets, 

Species: dog
Breed: border collie golden retriever mix (best guess) 
Age: approx 13 (she is a rescue)
Spayed/neutered: yes
Weight: 15kg or 33.5 (she has recently lost weight and we have increased her food. She is normally 37-40lbs vets thought it was due to muscle loss. 


My dog in the past year has greatly declined. She is completely deaf and has recently developed cataracts in one eye. Her mobility and back end weakened has slowly gotten worse. These issues have been hard for her but she had still been happy, eating all of her meals, occasionally playing with our other dog, and still enjoying  going on walks to sniff. 

In the past month she has gone from getting up, pacing, and needing to go outside 2-3 times to waking us up every hour to hour and a half. We are currently taking turns sleeping on the couch and letting her outside every hour and generally trying to keep her calm. We are both exhausted. 

We have discussed what has been happening with our vet, but they haven’t suggested any medication or treatment. What I want to to know is whether there is more we can do to help her. She seems really anxious when pacing like she doesn’t know where she is. We also use night lights and try to keep her active during the day. 

She has also recently lost weight and we have increased her food. Would this be related to the pacing or is it something else entirely? 

Sorry for the long post I am just feeling lost and sad for my poor girl.

Things are deteriorating in your pup. Her intestines are likely not as good at absorbing nutrients and this is a common issue in older dogs, so weight loss can be an issue. You can request bloodwork if you havent had it done recently to assess organ function, and there may be some medications that can be used to help prolong her life, but quality (of hers AND yours) need to be addressed.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/q1yx3b/senior_dog_with_back_end_weakness_fecal/#hfho5ux,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My dog is 20 years old blind, deaf, with dementia and arthritis. Is it time?
My dog is a maltese who is 20 years old. She has arthritis, is blind, deaf and with dementia. 

I took my dog last year to the vet because I thought she was ready to cross the rainbow bridge. However, my vet who is a holistic vet told me she was still healthy and didn't recommend euthenizing her yet. However, she barks excessively out of nowhere at all hours. She rest a lot which I understand. I feel bad for her since she is blind she is always bumping into things and we have to guide her. She can't control her bladder any nore and will pee anywhere. When I pick her up I can feel the arthritis. The vet also mentioned she might have dementia. I feel it in my heart she has to go but after the vet said no I feel like I must let her die naturally.

,"Sorry you are struggling with the 'is it time' decision. I have been there twice in the past year, so I know it's a hard place to be in with a pet. Our vet told us they are of the opinion, ""It's better to error on the side of too soon rather than a second too late."" If you have the option to do in home euthanasia I highly recommend it as it made the whole ordeal far easier for both us and our dogs.

When we were trying to determine how long to wait with the first dog we lost this year (terminal and on borrowed time) I reached out to my cousin who is a veterinary oncologist for help evaluating quality of life. She shared the guidance she gives her patients with me, and it really helped us gauge the timing.

""To monitor your pet's quality of life, pick 5 things they like to do the most. These can be small things like perking up for a ride in the car, playing with a certain toy, napping in a certain spot. Daily, your pet should be doing 3 of its 5 favorite things for it to be considered a good day. If there is a change to only doing 2 of the 5 favorite things, and we are having more bad days then good days in a 7-day period, we need to decide if we are doing everything we can for your pet's comfort, or if euthanasia would be the most appropriate option.""

I know it's especially hard with older dogs who've had a slow decline. The thing your vet seems to be ignoring is that natural death of an elderly dog can be slow - most of us don't have the good fortune to have a situation where they just pass peacefully in their sleep - and they might not always show signs of pain and discomfort until it's pretty severe. You can talk to the vet about medication for pain and arthritis, but if the dog is older and already having issues with bladder/kidney/liver, etc., certain medications can put extra stress on those systems and might lead to other issues, so you'll have to discuss with the vet and weigh the risks/benefits of medicating a 20-year-old dog.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ebnok9/my_dog_is_20_years_old_blind_deaf_with_dementia/#lexgdko,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's OK to provide him with a peaceful passing, even though he's happy 90% of the time, and not wait until he's miserable 60% of the time before doing so. There is nothing wrong with going out on a good day. 

It's also very common for pet owners of elderly dogs to feel some relief after euthanasia; it IS a lot of work, physically and especially emotionally to take care of our older pets. You don't have to feel guilty about the fact that it might make aspects of your life easier (although please know guilt is a very common emotion in these situations); it doesn't sound like that's why you're considering this choice. It's just a side aspect.

,"From one pet parent to another, I’m sorry that you’re going through this now. The fact that you are even debating this decision and seeking advice demonstrates what a wonderful pet parent you are.

My vet provided me with this [OSU diagnostic] (https://vet.osu.edu/vmc/sites/default/files/import/assets/pdf/hospital/companionAnimals/HonoringtheBond/HowDoIKnowWhen.pdf) to better determine when it may be time to euthanize. It can be helpful in minimizing the likelihood of feeling like you’re second-guessing yourself. 

That said, my vet did say that, even if most of the  diagnostic points are not met, good pet parents usually have an idea of when it might be time to euthanize given the specifics of the situation. Based on what you’ve shared, it seems you are there. 

It won’t make it any easier, but from an outside perspective it sounds like you are making the right decision. Right now, although he’s experiencing significant cognitive decline, your dog still knows you and loves you and knows how much you love him. Give him a really good day together and then be with him as he goes.

I would first discuss this with the vet to rule out any treatable medical issues causing the aggression. But yes, euthanasia is a perfectly valid option.

As someone who has had to make this same decision, it is not your fault.

There are diseases that we cannot cure. A disease (or old age) that is causing aggression is not something he would want. You have had him for years, do you truly believe he would want to hurt you or your family if he wasn't being affected by this disease? In this scenario, a humane euthanasia is a blessing, not a curse. He gets to go our remembering your love, not feeling like he was abandoned in a strange place, and not feeling bad because he unintentionally harmed you.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/k3w7t3/my_dog_has_dementia_and_is_aggressive_is_it/#ge62e0f,,,,,,,,,,,,

My approximately 12 year old dog is showing unusual signs of pacing in the evenings. Sometimes, he just abruptly stops for a few minutes and just stares into space. At times, he walks to the corner of the room & just stares. He also wants to go outside every 20 minutes or so repeatedly. He goes out one door, circles around the house & comes in another door.

"Does my dog have dementia or something else
My dog is around 6-7 years old. We found him almost starved on a beach un Ecuador when he was about a year old. He was full of ticks. It turned out he had erlichiosis and we treated him with several rounds of antibiotics until it wasn't traceable anymore. We had him tested for all tropical diseases when we got back home and they were all negative.

For about a year he has been having episodes where I feel he's not himself. I feel he is afraid and comes to one of us ( my husband or me) looking to be comforted but when we touch him he bites. Then he snaps back into his normal self and seems distressed by what happened. Most of the time he is normal and happy and we can cuddle hin no problem. We have been doing dehaviorak therapy he gets sedarom tablets as a mood stabiliser and have been doing behavioural therapy, he is not in pain, we tried physio therapy and we did a full body x Ray with no issues visible. He is castrated and has been for years. We regularly go mantrailing and he gets 3 -4 walks a day. He has some food sensitivities, basically he can't eat anything orange, like carrots or pumpkin, but we have those under control and take good care of his nutritional needs. He is a mixed race 23 kg medium sized  dog. We are convinced there is a lot of herding dog in him.

Those episodes are happening more often and are getting worse and it's incredibly unpredictable.  It also not just a little bite, it's very aggressive, rage-like.

We are becoming hopeless, it's starting to become too dangerous since we have a child, we can't risk him having an episode when she near him. 

I just want to know what is happening and if there is a chance we can still help him become himself again. Could the malnourishiment in his youth have something to do with it? Could it be some form of early dementia or some other disease?

"Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…
We had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We'd take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he'd immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn't see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he'd start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn't really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren't worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)

One year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren't in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We'd try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he'd just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.

Finally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.

A week later, our dog's balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That's when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog's sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His ""sundowners"" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It's absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.

**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog's body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam. 

CCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don't want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.

Here are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:

In summary:

* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.
* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.
* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.
* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.
* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).
* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.
* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.
* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/,,37,,,,,,,,,,

They ran a bunch of tests, did mri etc and didn’t really figure out what was the source of pain other than “he is old and it can be anything “.. we have been able to keep him comfortable with 2x CBD oil and about 10 days ago started on gabapentin every 12 hours. At this point we are just trying to spoil, love him and keep him comfortable.

My girl (14 y.o. pittie) woke up as I was getting ready for work as usual. But she often comes into the bathroom to check on me and she was hanging out in the hallway. 

She didn’t know where she was and I called her to me and she didn’t come. I went over and she was shaking like a leaf and wouldn’t make eye contact. She was backed against the wall. I got her breakfast ready and the smell of the food helped. She turned away any time I went near her. I had to lure her to go outside with treats. 

Usually she follows me to the door as I leave because I give her a bone before I shut the door and she stayed in another room. It broke my heart. 

Yesterday she was so clingy and climbing all over me and sitting on me - which she has not done in months - so I gave up trying to do anything and just let her cuddle on me for a few hours. It was the sweetest, best feeling. 

It was such a complete 180 to this morning. It’s just proof that I don’t know how much longer she has. I’m not going to let her live in pain, and I am certainly not going to let her live in fear.

,"CCD is often described as 'doggy dementia' (in layperson's terms?).  One common denominator out of various symptoms is confusion.   Dogs will wander or suddenly become confused in their surroundings.   Mine will walk around and insist on going forward even when she encounters an obstacle - something that is either there usually or something new - and she'll just stop and wait there.   They often don't want to change direction or back up.   

If there is some diminished eyesight and hearing, it makes it worse (the experience for the dog is worse).   It the most severe conditions, I have read that a dog can become so confused, it doesn't remember ppl, other animals/dogs etc.   That's pretty severe and sad!  :-(

"Conflicted on saying goodbye to my 15 year old dachshund with CCD/dementia
Sorry this is very long but I need to tell my story and hopefully get validation and comfort in my decision.

tl;dr: My dog has dementia that's slowly been getting worse and it might be time to let him go.

Today is Wednesday and I scheduled a euthanasia appointment for my sweet pup for this coming Monday. He is \~15 year old dachshund and I've had him for over 14 of those years. Since 2022, he's been exhibiting all the classic signs of CCD: Pacing, getting stuck in corners, personality changes. He's been on a prescription diet, selegiline, and Senilife since the beginning.

For a really long time, his main symptom was aimless wandering and standing in corners. He seemed pretty undeterred though, getting himself out without assistance and carrying on his way, showing no anxiety. When he was tired of wandering, he'd get in his bed and rest. He stopped playing with toys within a year of diagnosis, but continued to play chase with the cat. Eventually he needed belly bands for his old man bladder but no big deal. While his personality was slowly fading, he was still essentially himself in my eyes. In addition to his cognitive meds, he was also on carprofen for arthritis.

A lot has changed in 2024. He started to circle along with his wandering/pacing. He gets stuck all the time. He had a tiny stroke. He started having nighttime anxiety. He needs calming meds (2 gabapentin, CBD, and a melatonin chew) to sleep through the night, but it's hit or miss. He also had to be moved from his bed in the bedroom into a round playpen in a separate room so he can get up and pace if he needs to without waking us up. He sometimes zones out when we go outside for walks and won't move. He zones out in front of his food bowl and it takes him a minute to realize what's going on before he starts eating. I have to hold up his bowl to his mouth to help him eat. He had to go off of carprofen in May and we were unsuccessful in getting him back on it (GI issues). We tried Galliprant and he also had side effects to that, though not as severe. He's starting to occasionally lose control of his bowels, and there's been a few times where we will go out on the weekend and come home to a poor pup who has pooped in his playpen and then gotten it stuck in his paws as he paced over it.

The last few months have been really hard for me. I've been obsessively trying to find ways to hold back the flood. Some things have worked and I wished I'd tried them sooner. Those things are Denamarin/SAMe, CBD, and Gold Standard Herbs Halscion. The combination has really helped his depression/anxiety and circling, and I'd recommend them to anyone else in this situation. But I digress. The amount of energy I've put into taking care of my dog has drained me completely. It's impacting my relationship with my boyfriend. It's impacting my performance at work (luckily I WFH). It's certainly impacting my mental health. I always feel exhausted and depressed, unable to really enjoy my life and feeling trapped.

After months of thinking about it but not truly taking the leap, this past weekend I really considered if now was time. Once I started to accept that it could be, my heart broke but it also felt like the most compassionate choice. I didn't think I was keeping him here for me, because everything I've gone through to keep him comfortable has been so difficult, but maybe I have been because now all I can think about is how much I'm going to miss him. It's also so hard because with dementia, there isn't an obvious moment to make the decision. I could keep him here longer, maybe much longer, if I really wanted to. We do get at least one slow walk in per day. He does eat his food. Thanks to the Denamarin/CBD/Halscion, he rests more during the day and paces less. He is on my lap now wrapped in a blanket, and it's everything to have him so close. Part of me wonders, what if.. what if we tried Galliprant again? What if we tried that other cognitive supplement? But I know it would at best give us a couple short months of only relative improvement. He's not doing the things dogs love to do. He doesn't interact with me much. No toys, no tail wags, no joyfully scarfing down his food or begging for treats. His essence is faded.

It feels like now would be the time to let him go, before his whole life is confusion and anxiety, while he still knows who I am and gets some comfort from my presence. It feels like we're in a compassionate window, where it might in fact not be too early and not too late. But how do I ever possibly go through with it? I am beside myself at the thought of him being gone forever. It's so so hard.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fp9c4p/conflicted_on_saying_goodbye_to_my_15_year_old/,,40,,,,,,,,,,
,"I'm so sorry. I've lost 3 dogs in 3 years and 2 of them took extreme care-taking for a year before I had to make the decision to let them go. You did everything you could. You took the best care of him! It's ok to let him go now. It sounds like he's not even aware of life much of the time. And there's probably more bad times than good times ahead. It's ok. You know him best. It's hard, but what if's are so unlikely just to keep him going a little bit more.  It's ok to let him rest now.  If you're still unsure and you trust your vet to be honest, maybe call and talk to them.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fp9c4p/conflicted_on_saying_goodbye_to_my_15_year_old/#lovuhdw,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You are doing the right thing. 

I'm not going to bore you with the details of my pet losses.  Just know, that making this decision doesn't come easy for anyone. A good pet owner always second-guess themselves. Why wouldn't they? They love their pets so much that they don't want to let them die. 

Now that you've made the choice, think about all the things that you need to do to fill his bucket list.  My biggest recommendation is the obvious one which is to spend as much time with him and take pictures, lots of pictures, and videos.  Some photographers offer free or discounted professional photos for dying pets.   Check out https://thetillyproject.org

I don't think you mentioned in your post whether you are going to have the euthanasia done at home or at the vet's office. I would highly suggest having it done at home.  The site below will let you search for at home euthanasia providers in your area.

I am really sorry that you have to go through this. It's going to suck any which way you slice it.  But you are going to bear the pain so that your puppy won't have to anymore.  He has done his job, and you have done all that you can for him. It's time for him to go ahead of the trail and wait for you.

,"I really relate to your story, I said goodbye to my 16.5 year old shih-tzu with advanced dementia on Aug 12. His dementia went downhill quickly over the course of three-ish months, and by the end I was so exhausted trying to keep him from hurting himself and worrying and medicating him and waking up multiple times in the middle of the night in a panic to check on him. I agonized over it for so long, because despite everything that was going on cognitively he still ate absolutely everything that was put in front of him and could go for short walks even though his mind was “gone”. 

In the end there was a day when I realized I could no longer leave him unsupervised in the house, so I picked a Monday, cancelled my plans for the weekend, fed him steak and ice cream and tons of other goodies, took him to his favourite park and was able to say goodbye peacefully with him in my arms at home. I miss him so so much (even all the fussing over him and medicating him and constant worrying about him) but in hindsight I’m so glad it didn’t come to an emergency situation where I would have to take him to a clinic in his confused state.

And in the end, we must grieve their loss in our own way.  The depths of grief are a direct reflection of the depths of love that you felt.  And the pain you feel is your heart turning your loss into memories.

"Dog with CCD
Hi everyone. I need some advice. Pardon the long post but there's a lot to say. 

So I rescued my staffy, Tilly, at 3 weeks old. I hand-reared her and she's been by my side ever since. We've been through 9 years of life together and have a very strong bond. She's my soul dog. Obviously, you build a strong bond with a dog when you bottle feed them every hour and then help them wean, your basically their mum. Then later in life I lost my dad (I was 21) and it sent my Bipolar into a spiral. She literally saved my life multiple times, like literally, she alerted the neighbours to me being passed out, she pulled me off a window ledge, and so many more things. She's literally lived every trauma, success, everything with me. 

When we moved into our bigger house, now married and with a child, we got a second dog. A boxer pup. She absolutely loved him. She babied him and washed him. They were best friends. 

Earlier this year she was diagnosed with CCD (canine dementia) and her personality started to change. She's always been feisty but she's started attacking our other dog (he's one now) and not even my presence can calm her, like it used to. We've had to keep them separated and its breaking my heart. Luckily we have a big enough house to comfortably do this, but I miss snuggling them both on the sofa and seeing them play. 

She's back at the vets Monday and I'm hoping they can give her something to help with the aggression. Its breaking me to see her so distressed, and to see my boxer boy being hurt. 

What does the road map from here look like? Are we near the end of the road? Do I have a tough decision in my immediate future? ",,https://i.redd.it/gm5j6f3gmiud1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1g2oaxb/dog_with_ccd/,,41,,,,,,,,,,
,"CCD can be tough but it's manageable.  I had a dog live with it for 2 years, though his symptoms weren’t severe, and he eventually passed from an unrelated issue.  However, our most recent girl had severe CCD symptoms.  She would pace, pant, spin until she fell over, get stuck in corners or under furniture, and bang into walls- it was heartbreaking. The vets often prescribed medications like Gabapentin, Trazodone, and sometimes even Xanax or Prozac, none of which are specifically for CCD.  We only tried Gabapentin and Trazodone, but they caused more harm than good.

There's a common medication now called Selegiline (Anipryl), and some have had success with it, though it can have side effects too.  We were considering euthanasia when we decided to consult a holistic vet.  She recommended and guided us with CBD oil, and it completely stopped our girl’s symptoms.  We were fortunate to have another year together.  When signs of aggression appeared, we separated her from the other dogs, but the CBD mellowed her out, and the aggression was no longer an issue.

It may or may not work for your dog, but consulting a holistic vet is worth considering.  They often have more knowledge on how to manage CCD.  You’re not at the end of the road- you're at the start of what might be a long and difficult journey.  Finding the right combination of supplements (and possibly medications) can make that road easier to navigate.  There is a CCD group on Facebook that has a lot of information and people dealing with it.

"CCD and selegiline senior chiweenie

My husband tries to encourage me to believe that he’s still happy and fine doing the things he does now. Which I think is true, I don’t think he knows any different, you know? Because if they did then they probably would at least try to engage in activities they used to do. I think they adjust pretty easily because they’re such adaptive animals. Now I just try to engage with him on his new level. So we still do walks but I’m about to get a stroller. I will try to play with his old toys but if he doesn’t engage then we do a puzzle. He has not lost his love of food so we do lots of puzzles and mental stimulation with treats! And he’s a sleepier boy now too so I take in all the cuddles and how sweet he is when I can move about the house without waking him up.

"Pain, PTSD, or CCD for a 13 year old Chihuahua?
My wife and I have 3 pets: 13m chihuahua, 13f cat, and 1.5m chihuahua. I work at home so I am with the pets all day, my wife works outside the house and is home mornings and evenings. The cat hides in the basement since the puppy has been introduced. We want her to eventually be able to be comfortable around the young chi to join us upstairs. Dogs get walked multiple (4+) times per day. They also both sleep with us in our bed.

We found the younger chihuahua this past August on the street. When no one claimed him, we decided to keep him and he was neutered eight weeks ago. He is very sweet and affectionate 95% of the time, but occasionally will snap, go berserk and viciously snap at the 13m chihuahua and occasionally my wife.  He has now bit my wife on 3 occasions. Each time these bites happen if he is disturbed when resting or woken up. We will also have to hold him back because he has a tendency to redirect it towards our older Chihuahua if he is nearby. His demeanor always goes back to normal (which is very affectionate/tolerant) after a quick separation, but. We have hired a dog trainer who has told us that this behavior is because he is scared, and that when he is burrowed up or sleeping he becomes really reactive. we are working on training methods to lesson these responses, which will hopefully calm him down enough for our cat and our elder Chihuahua

The 13m chihuahua is our primary concern. My wife has had him since he was a puppy, and he has always been a very snuggly and affectionate dog. After finding the younger chi the 13m Chihuahua was diagnosed with pituitary Cushing's disease (which was otherwise not in full swing yet), and found to have some mass cell tumors that had to be removed (one in the center of his chest and the other on his rear leg leaving some pretty serious scars). These tumors were rated low on both of the relevant grading scales when lab work was done, and they had clean margins when removed. They also did an x-ray of his lungs, which were clear of any cancer and they did his bloodwork, which did not alert them to anything other than the Cushing's. When in recovery  the younger chi because the younger would snap at our senior about once per day, and as a toothless old man, he wasn't really able to defend himself. Fortunately we were able to intervene before any real conflict broke out. The 13m Chi had to get stitches removed 2 weeks post-op and did not take the experience well by yelling and howling throughout the whole process (he turned 13 the day after). Now, six weeks post-op and four weeks post stitch removal, our once very affectionate and physical chi is acting totally different.  The combination of the new stressful younger chi puppy, medical scares for the older chi, and a recent tragic loss of a friend, has caused an overall very anxious and sad vibe in our home since the beginning of October, which I fear is exacerbating these problems.

What was once a very snuggly, kissy, and physically affectionate dog has gotten very touch sensitive and will yelp, growl, and retreat just a few feet away when we attempt to touch.  This behavior is more pronounced in the evening, which is unfortunate, because this is when my wife gets home and she is unable to love her baby boy.  He will stand a few feet away from us, and just growl lowly, tail wagging. He will then hop up and beg to be held, only by me at this point, where he can be touched and pet as normal (he will also give kisses). If we are on the couch, he will sit in physical contact with us (either next to us or on top of us directly) but any attempt to touch him with our hands is met with the response mentioned above. We brought him to our vet, who did a routine physical, and ruled out any obvious physical pain through applying pressure to his body and joint manipulation. He had been in surgery recently, and so they had a fairly recent physical and bloodwork for him, and we had just dropped off a stool sample with no red flags. She also ruled out any cataract caused blindness and hearing loss. She prescribed Senilife, which he has been on a little less than 2 weeks, to help with any potential cognitive decline, and she also prescribed painkillers in case any residual pain from the surgery was causing this behavior. He was only on the painkillers for a few days, before she took him off of them to see if there was any change. I was out of town at this time, and my wife was their primary caretaker. During this week of my absence, she said that he was feeling and acting a lot better. When I came back from my trip, he started acting up again. Our vet told us not to start him back on the painkillers, but encouraged us to provide chewable CBD tablets (5mg / day) and Melatonin in the evening. With another week of no visible improvement, she has now prescribed Gabapentin in the evenings, which we started yesterday. As of now, he has not been on any of these supplements or medications for more than 2 weeks. Maybe we need to stick with the routine a little longer to begin seeing results?

He is still excited for food and has a healthy appetite, very alert, and has a good trotting when he is on his many daily walks (he is enthusiastic when we put on his harness, no touch sensitivity at all). He doesn't play as much with the new puppy as he did when they first were introduced, but I attribute that to the age difference, the surgery, and any residual pain he might be in. He does get very short tempered when the puppy wants to play with him, but they sleep next to each other all day by my feet when I am working with no incident.  I had a dog with CCD before, and she was not acting like this when she succumbed, but maybe this is early stages? He doesn't get stuck behind things. At night he has some trouble using his doggy steps (which he was normally very proficient in) but that has been occurring ever since the new dog was introduced, and there was a lot of early nighttime conflict on the steps between the two. Throughout the day he manages to use them fine. He will sleep cuddled in my wife's arms the whole night, occasionally waking up and going to the bathroom, or he will get up and growl at us from the bed (perhaps at the puppy?). He will then come back to his spot in her arms when asked. He has always been trained to use an indoor pee-pad for all of his bathroom needs and he is consistent in using them (when I don't take them out). I filled out a CCDR evaluation, and depending on how I interpreted some of his recent behaviors, he was either not suffering from CCD, or in the ""At Risk"" bracket. I have one of those cross body dog carry bags, and when he is it he is as snuggly and calm as he has always been. He is more tolerant of my contact then of my wife.

For our older Chihuahua we mainly have the following concerns:

1. He is in still in some form of pain from the surgery or from another source.

2. He has developed touch sensitivity as a result from the trauma of the last few weeks of surgery and overall environment of our house. We hope that this can be modified or will lessen with training / time / pharmaceutical intervention.

3. He is exhibiting symptoms of CCD and we will need to start some kind of treatment. I've heard positive things about ""herbal"" oil, as well as Senilife. I have read that Anipryl (Selegiline) is the only FDA approved medication for CCD treatment as well as Cushings. 

4. Some combination of the above.

Looking for any advice or anecdotes. Part of me knows that the treatments he is on have just started, and they will take time. But I also try and practice ""Hope for the best, prepare for the worst."". We just want to have our sweet old dog back to normal, or at the very least comfortable and at ease.  I have done a QoL evaluation, and he seems to be still very much in the healthy range.

,"Is it possible to keep the dogs in separate areas while the older dog recovers?

How soon after surgery did the new behavior start? My senior chi who was displaying very mild CCD symptoms (just wandering, getting stuck in corners) HAD to go in for a dental, his bloodwork came back GREAT, his heart was in great shape but after anesthesia he immediately started declining and the dementia got markedly worse.

We did do a ton of supplements, Senilife, blueberry extract powder and salmon oil which did seem to help. We also made sure he was comfortable and had no stress.

We did eventually also try selegeline. We had poor results but some people report great results so maybe join some CCD FB groups and get some advice there.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/17wyccy/pain_ptsd_or_ccd_for_a_13_year_old_chihuahua/#k9kiv54,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's looking like tomorrow might be farewell for now. 
I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, maybe just so other people keep him in their minds in the next twelve hours or so. 

This is Buster. He's 15 and a half years old. My grandmother bought him from an online ad listing when I was just a kid (28 now) and was told he's a full bred pomeranian. We've since conceded that we were lied to and his vet says he's lucky if he's ever even smelled a full bred pomeranian which still makes me laugh. 

In the past he's survived a broken leg, gum disease leaving him with zero teeth after a full extraction, and more recently arthritis and canine cognitive dysfunction (doggy dementia) as well as reduced liver function.

He's always been an anxious little guy, but it's constant lately - the pacing in tight circles, waking up scratching and whining at 3am, uncharacteristic snapping at familiar people. We started him on pain management and anxiety medication over a year ago now when he began urinating indoors - turned out he was just too stiff to get off the sofa in time to go outside! He was back to his usual shelf, playing in the garden, desperate for cuddles; but recently even his groomer had noticed him becoming more restless and fearful, and increasing meds hasn't helped at all.

Two weeks ago he ended up with two open wounds from obsessively picking at his skin - even without teeth he did serious damage to himself from a combination of pain and CDD. He was given antibiotics, steroids, antibacterial cream and confined to the cone of shame for two weeks. He healed up beautifully but the cone had to go back on as he was still biting himself like crazy. His appetite has all but disappeared- which is so concerning as he had to use slow feeders his whole life because the boy is ravenous. 

This evening he managed to wiggle out of his cone, and his entire inner thigh is red and oozing from his constant biting and gnawing at his skin. It's not an allergy, and he hasn't been laying in urine or anything like that. Nothing will distract him, nothing will interrupt him, and it's impossible to get the cone back on because he's so aggressive. His eyesight and hearing are both fading. He doesn't want food, rarely wants company lately, and just looks so confused and scared that it breaks my heart.

I think tomorrow I need to call the vet in the morning (we have a wonderful team at the vets we go to who make us feel so safe and reassured thankfully) and ask whether they agree that it might be time to let him go with some amount of peace and dignity. We managed to sneak his Gapapentin dose into some cheese and get him to take it and he's resting now, thankfully. Still occasionally getting up to pace, but pulling at his leg less. I just know it's a huge infection waiting to happen and even if we manage to treat the physical wound again, his spirit isn't there any more, and we'll be in the same situation but worse again in another two weeks. We had a feeling he wouldn't make it past Christmas, but I didn't expect to be saying goodbye quite so soon either somehow. 

My heart is breaking as I type. He's worth every second of the sadness, but this responsibility is the heaviest part of having a four legged companion. Please think of little Buster tonight, and let me know if I'm doing the right thing. I know I am, but I need to hear it from someone else too, yknow? Love to you all.

"Cognitive dysfunction and frequent night accidents - any tips?
Hey all

I have a 15yr old Lab who is fairly mobile (does struggle to get up) but not really active. She's almost 100% deaf and her eyesight isn't great. She pretty much sleeps all day long but when awake she just paces around panting a lot. In addition to that she started randomly pooping and peeing in the house a few months ago but now it has become a daily occurrence. I wouldn't say it's uncontrollable as se doesn't seem to do it during the day and we mostly find it around 7am when we get up. She'll often step in it and walk it through the house too.

So we took her to the vet for blood work and urine and results came back normal, or normal for her age anyway. They told us the panting/pacing is likely onset of dog dementia, as is the frequent accidents.

Is there anything we can do to control the accidents? I refuse to put her in diapers and we've never used pads so doubt she'd take to them. We've tried changing her feeding schedule as well as limit water early in the evening but even if I take her outside before we go to bed (midnight/1am) and watch her go, she'll still have an accident by the time we get up.

If it is behavioral and not incontinence, could we try crating her over night? Maybe feeding her once a day? Any medicines that help with this kind of stuff or will I just have to resort to get up at 3/4am every day to let her out?

TIA!

,"I just had to put my 15 year old pup down and he was suffering from some of what you mentioned. He didn’t have pee accidents though. And his poop accidents happened when he struggled to get up. I don’t think changing feeding schedule would have fixed it. He lost control of his bowels when his body struggled. Sometimes it was a full poop, sometimes just a little bit of poop. 

I was getting up with him every 3 hours in the night to prevent this. Basically, he slept in my room with the door closed and when I heard his paws I’d get up and we’d go outside. I was very very tired the past 3 months. 

I do know other dogs have incontinence issues in different ways. And CCD can also cause dogs to pee/poop in areas they would never previously, even though intentionally and not an “accident.” 

If your pup already is taking a melatonin supplement to help her get through the night, I’d try that at first. It helped my dog a lot for a few months, and really until the very end. His bowel issues didn’t really start until a few months ago, and didn’t get back until his last few weeks. But the melatonin helped with the pacing and restlessness, general sundowners. 

I’m not sure why you are so against diapers. I got belly bands for my dog (male, peeing)… but since he didn’t have pee accidents in the house, never actually used them. The poop diaper thing for me didn’t make sense cause my dog had super crazy thick fur on his back legs, tail, and butt area. And he hated baths, whcih I already had to do 2-3x a week cause he was falling into his poop (outside) when pooping due to bad arthritis and loss of leg muscles. But a poop diaper is better than shit around the house! 

Suggestions other than that: keep your dog contained to one room (preferably with someone) lay down sheet or something in that room for easy clean up. I would avoid limited water, since it’s so important to their health. And I would also avoid switching up her feeding schedule. Loss of muscle is real in older dogs, problems absorbing nutrients, and with CCD dogs can forget hunger cues/pains (similar to humans with dementia) and think they haven’t eaten or they are starving. You may consider always leaving food out, or at least sticking to her normal schedule. Same thing with a crate, if she wasn’t crate trained as a pup I wouldn’t introduce it now. CCD can be frightening and anxiety inducing. I would pay attention to those signs. 

You could try urinary track health dog vitamins (basically cranberry supplement). Unfortunately, I don’t think there is much else to do. Maybe someone else has better advice though.

,"I’m glad you posted this because my 12 year old dog has pee accidents during the night while we are sleeping. He will wake up and pace around and then urinate in a couple of the same spots. 

We walk him before we get into bed, but I’m thinking we need to walk him closer to when we actually go to sleep which can be a good 1-2 hours after getting into bed. 

I recently had 2 months off in between jobs and I walked him more frequently throughout the day and he had NO nighttime accidents! Now that my husband and I are both working he’s back to having accidents. Not sure if it’s due to us not being around during the day or what. We walk him twice in the morning and when my husband gets home he walks him, so there another 2 times in the afternoon/evening. 

I am going to bring up melatonin to our vet the next time we’re in. Until then I’m just going to try to walk him as much as I can and get up in the night when I hear him pacing.

,"I have a 15 year old who was experiencing something similar. She started pacing at night and developed an attachment to certain areas of the house where she felt comfortable. She’s deaf and almost blind. She gets “lost” in the backyard at night and will start to panic and dig at the floor if she gets turned around in a corner in the house. All of this at night. During the day she sleeps like a puppy. She started to have mini accidents (diarrhea not pee) at night during the pacing and then when we’d take her out she would try to go but wasn’t producing anything. This would go on every few hours until sunrise. During the day she had totally normal bowel function and old dog behaviors, just a lot more sleeping. Off to the vet and now we are treating the anxiety that is causing the accidents. She takes low-dose anxiety medication (not sedation) at night and we’ve had success. We’ve also added cognitive supplements, calming substances, and senior probiotics to her diet. Overnight the change was immediate. Recognizing that we’re in the final chapter here, but our old girl is so much more comfortable and her anxiety caused by the decline is managed, which resolved the nighttime pacing and accidents.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/15x5obz/cognitive_dysfunction_and_frequent_night/#jxzkr9e,,,,,,,,,,,,

"How many months/years of sundowning before you made the call?
Hi all. Just curious, for those who went through CCD and sundowning, how long did you handle it before making the call to put them to sleep?

My dog’s first bout of sundowning happened summer of ‘23. We started to manage his pain and liver issues and it really wasn’t too bad. He only paced in the evening and still today goes to bed and stays asleep for the night. However, the daily pacing and accidents have ramped up in the last couple months

So much so that my husband and I kind of had a dose of reality yesterday when we remembered how only in the spring of this year we decided we wouldn’t do any vacations or overnights because we didn’t feel comfortable leaving him with a babysitter or having someone just do potty breaks. And how now, after just the last month or two, we are like there’s absolutely no way we could leave him. Although he is manageable, he still requires around the clock care. 

He has started going in the house very frequently (sometimes 3 times a day) which is fine, really not a big deal. When he does go potty outside, especially at night, he will start rapidly pacing and following a path over and over again. When it snowed the other week he got stuck on this path and started barking for help so we had to do a search and rescue operation. This has been happening a lot at night where we’ll let him pace in hopes he’ll go, but eventually we have to call it and direct him back inside. I don’t think it’s just a vision thing (although when you call for him, even right in front of him, he looks off trying to find us), he’s just frantically pacing. 

This is in addition to constant pacing throughout the day. Eventually I can get him to lay down, but he will be restless for a good portion of the day, and then it happens again in the evening. 

I’m just trying to gage if I have blindness to these issues because in most aspects he still seems happy to be here and fortunately is sleeping through the night. Or if this kind of pacing and the accidents are worthy of letting him rest. 

He is on gabapentin, galliprant, and denamarin. We started selegiline ~1.5 months ago, not seeing  much from that yet. And I started him on senelife today. He’s a parson Russel mix and turned 15 in August.

,"We were at the point of calling Lap of Love to plan for saying goodbye, but we reached out to a holistic vet first.  She recommended and guided us with CBD oil and that was a game changer.  Our girl needed nothing else- the CBD oil stopped the pacing, panting, spinning, anxiety....everything.  We got an extra year with her until we ended losing her to another issue.  Maybe that could help your boy.  He's on so many things right now, which honestly, could be making the issue worse.  The side effects of many of the medications commonly prescribed for CCD are the same as the symptoms of CCD.  Our vet basically said cut everything out and give the CBD oil a shot.  If you have a holistic vet in your area or if there is one you could telemed, that would be a good option.  You have nothing to lose.

,"The greatest gift we can return to our dogs is to not allow them to just exist. They have given us unconditional love. We need to return that to them. When they can no longer be the dog they were born to be. It's time. They aren't living as a dog . They are existing with a life that without constant care . They would pass into God's arms sooner.

,"Adopted  my 13 yr old GSD in late November 2022.  Yes. We got her when she was 11.


She started sundowning noticeably spring of this year. She was already on Prozac since December 22 for severe separation and general anxiety (I work from home but need to go out for groceries, school stuff for my son, plus dog sitting my neighbors pups). 

Added in melatonin pm, then melatonin am and pm plus CBD oil. The CBD has made the most difference. She’s not zombified at all, she is her usual sweet prancing funny girl self. I’ve had times where I’ve run out of CBD and it’s very noticeable. 


As the other person said if they’re zonked out the dose is too high.  Even though she’s lost some hearing and vision she’s still very spunky on this cocktail. Also she’s on Librela and bright minds by Purina. I don’t know how long we will have but as long as she’s prancing and enjoying each day we will keep going.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gucdn0/how_many_monthsyears_of_sundowning_before_you/#lxubm6a,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your situation is so familiar. Our sweet Bella was mostly blind, deaf & incontinent all of which we worked with because she was also seemed mostly happy. But in her last 6 months, her anxiety intensified, even with medications. She seemed lost, crying until I held her til she calmed. Night pacing began at 3:00 am, so I got up and held her. We didn’t leave together for long because we were afraid of what we could find even tho we Bella-proofed the house & yard. She wore a bell so we could find her as she paced. Luckily I’m retired and was able to give her the attention she needed. 

We loved her so much. There was never a sweeter soul on the planet. But, ultimately I was exhausted & she was so anxious despite more & stronger medications to calm her. My heart told me it was time to let her go in a calm, loving way instead of as result of an emergency. The hardest part was forgiving myself for making the right decision. Listen to your heart.

"Tips for doggy dementia pacing and lack of interest in play/walks?


My 14.5 year old Parson Russell Terrier mix has canine cognitive dysfunction and chronic pain (and possibly cushings but we’ve kept his levels at bay with medicine). Luckily I work from home so we have a pretty set routine and I am with him 99% of the time. He takes gabapentin for his pain and we see a chiropractor so I think that’s managed pretty well. The problem is that in the morning, when we used to play and then get settled for work, he now has a new routine that consists of him pacing up and down the hall for an hour or more. 

He doesn’t play with toys anymore, which is really sad because he LOVED toys and fetch. If I try to play with him with a stuffed animal he will bite at it and immediately let go. Very rarely will we actually play tug-o-war, and if we do, it lasts literally 30 secs if I’m lucky. He doesn’t play fetch anymore either. I’d throw his ball down the hall over and over and he’d never tire. Over the last year that changed to shorter bouts from him getting tired eventually to now I throw it down the hall and he just barks at me. He does have these little squeakers (emoji-like, from Walmart) that he also used to love, and those I can sometimes get him to play with, but again, he’ll chase it down the hall if I’m lucky. I can throw it closer to him and shorten the distance, and he might go for them, but he’ll just catch it or grab it and instantly drop it and just bark at me. 

I know he is not blind or deaf (which we thought initially) as our vet verified he’s good (he does have blue overlay on his eyes from fluid build up but he’s on an ointment and she said it really just affects depth perception and night vision). I try to stimulate him with a puzzle game and putting treats in a towel I wrap up. That’s kind of substituted playing but he will still pace after doing this. If I firmly demand that he lay down or go to bed, he’ll look at me and turn around to pace again. It’s like he’s on a magnetic conveyor belt, comes down, looks into the office, turns right back around to go to the living room. And he’ll do this over and over. I let him out in case he needs to go potty but forgot, but this will continue until he either listens to me to lay down or eventually does it on his own. 

He also used to enjoy walks and walk normally with me and our other dog. Now he will be the whole length of the leash behind me for nearly the whole walk (an hour). By the end he will usually get to our pace and walk with us. It’s worse when we go through the neighborhood, he’s a little better when we go to the park. He used to be such a sniffy boy but now I consider it a good walk when he actually stops to sniff and stays up with us for any amount of time. Idk if much can be done to get him back to loving walks again but thought I’d throw that in there too in case anyone has ideas. 

I’m about to get some CBD our vet recommended so hopefully that will help. I don’t think we’re going to try that one doggy dementia med on the market because it can cause GI issues and he’s pretty sensitive in that area. But does anyone have any other tips to get him to stop pacing and any ideas on other toys that he might go for or actually play with? Thank you for any suggestions!!

,"Definitely get him in some medication like Selegiline or Trazodone. Those really help. I had one dog on Selegiline when he was 15 or 16 and it really helped his (and my!) quality of life. Eventually I did have to up his dose but it saved him.
Last year my then 16 year old dog had a fall which literally made him senile. I put him on gabapentin and Trazodone and eventually just Trazodone because the gabapentin made him sleep too much. The Trazodone helped immensely when I gave it at night, when his symptoms would kick in.
I would have liked to have tried Selegiline but the Dr never talked to me about transitioning him over to it but he did ok. 
Please discuss these medications with your doctor!
CBD wont do much, sorry :(

Also, for arthritis pain, ask them about Librela Injections! They don't help every dog, but when they do they DO!
Also it alternatively, you could try Cartroohen injections. I've seen these work wonders on dogs, even when started at an advanced age.

A natural supplement that can help with pain is green lipped mussel.

,"Our senior Aussie has dementia and right now it is worse at night. I know from experience with other senior dogs we’ve had it will progress to the day time. 

We always start with supplements. 

All our dogs are on good probiotics to ensure gut health. Ask your vet. 

The next thing we use is Vetriscience PRO Composure. These are calming treats. I have found that only the PRO line works. Unfortunately you may be past the point that these may help, but you never know! You can get these on Amazon. 

We also use compression shirts. We like Thundershirts because the cotton ones are easy to wash. Our senior likes them a lot. 

I’ve also found she thoroughly enjoys her heating pad. Go on Amazon and search for dog heating pad indoor and there are tons of options. Most of them have timers and adjustable temperatures. Our girl really enjoys this. 

She also likes her penguin. It is a buckwheat filled shell that we can put in the microwave and then stuff inside a soft penguin stuffed animal. The outside is washable. She likes to lay with her head on it or with it on her hip. Search on Amazon for microwave heat pad animal. 

Lastly we use low doses of Xanax. We decided not to use trazadone because it was way too sedating. The Xanax is more calming. Our girl is 14 and I know she will be taking this for the rest of her life. Our vet told us it’s safe but check with your vet. We give it at night but we can give a small dose in the afternoon if we need to. 

We also do training. Our girl cannot hear anymore at all so we have taught her sign language for outside, eat, walk, cookie, water and business (pee/poo). She responds really well to these and we noticed where before she would not want to get up, now when we do the sign for walk and cookie she “hops” up and “runs” to the door.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1bhv05q/tips_for_doggy_dementia_pacing_and_lack_of/#kvqvghi,,,,,,,,,,,,
,So challenging for you both. Sadly they lose interest and focus overall. I had some luck with the sundowner's restlessness and using melatonin.  The vet recommended 5 mg. You'll need to see what your vet says about it. I gave it to my 17 yr old chiweenie at dusk so it would kick in before night. It helped a bit but not completely. Keeping an area sectioned off for  nighttime that has no furniture and a dog bed is good. The pacing can turn into middle  of the night random wandering and getting stuck in odd places.

When she starts her pacing I just let her do it. I remind her that I’m here if she needs me but I also let her soothe herself. If pacing calms her down then I’m okay with it. 
My girl doesn’t always know her name so I call her silly old lady names in a quiet baby voice. That seems to get her attention. I also started making my own soft dog treats. I give her lots of “cookies” and that seems to pull her focus away from pacing.

,"Some of the problem may also be from vision/hearing loss. As they get older the lens gets cloudy - kind of like looking through a dirty windshield - it makes them more cautious when going for walks and also makes it very difficult to find their toys, especially in low light. As for hearing, they have a harder time figuring out where noises are coming from, and if there is a lot of noise, they get confused. Keeping them close to you and touching them frequently helps. If they become hesitant, bend down and say let's go. When they are pacing or seem agitated, try distracting them. Brushing, treats, playing, ear scritches, kong with peanut butter, all work well. I've been dealing with this for the last 2 years, and while I know my dog does get confused just due to his age, a lot has to do with his vision and hearing.

"How did you know when your dog got dementia? 


I have a 14 year old Pomeranian who I love dearly, he's my first dog and I just want to make the right choice (my apologies if this is long) 

A few months ago, my pup developed dry eyes which required me to do daily eye drops. After a few weeks of this, he started to become reactive when I got close to him so I stopped the medication. Luckily, it’s summer and he no longer has dry eyes. 

In the past few months, he’s become more and more aggressive towards me, my boyfriend and everyone that he knows. It’s to the point where I can’t even put his leash on without him biting my hands. I’m not sure if it’s to do with being upset about the past treatment plan, but I’m also starting to wonder if it’s dementia/cognitive decline. 

He seems upset and confused most of the day and was the most cuddly dog in the past. 

He still eats normally, uses the washroom outside, does tricks (on some days) and knows his way to the park. He’s friendly with other dogs on the street but barely walks- he’s incredibly slow and has trouble turning corners. I can see his legs shaking but if I pick him up, he’ll bark loudly in my arms and try his best to bite me. 

At night, he lays in bed and barks as if someone is there when I’m in the other room. I try to calm him down but he threatens to attack me so I just try to leave him alone. He also stopped letting my boyfriend get near him even though he’s been in his life since he was a puppy. 

I took him to the vet, he thinks the sudden aggression is to do with pain, arthritis and cognitive decline. He mentioned the main signs of dementia are things like house soiling, pacing, forgetting where his dish his but he doesn’t do any of those things. 
Instead, he just has a total change of character- more aggressive, reactive, doesn’t want to be touched/looked at. 

All of my friends think it’s time to euthanize him because he’s a completely different dog than he was a year ago, but I’m honestly not sure if this is a case of negative conditioning from his past treatment or if he is seriously confused/in pain. 

If you could please let me know your thoughts/experiences with senior dogs with CCD I would greatly appreciate it. 

I don’t want to euthanize a healthy dog that is just upset, but I also don’t want to make him live in pain if that’s the case. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1e6lvt5/how_did_you_know_when_your_dog_got_dementia/,,54,,,,,,,,,,

She’s on some medication for her dementia.

,"Our 13.5 yo Cavalier King Charles started pacing all around the house. He then became reactive when I tried to pet him or clean his face baring his teeth and growling. He would keep growling even after I walked away from him. He seemed stiff and it was hard for him to get up from his bed. His appetite changed and feedings have become a challenge. This all seemed to happen from one day to the next. 

We took him to the vet and he was diagnosed with doggie dementia. He’s now on trazodone and gabapentin. He’s a lot calmer and the pacing in the middle of the night has stopped. We thought it would knock him out but I guess it doesn’t when they really need it. We had tried hemp and cbd but it didn’t work. 

On the positive side, we have two min pins and he doesn’t bother them. He’s not waking us up in the middle of the night to go outside. Most importantly, we’ve found that we need to be consistent with the meds and we see the old Rocco instead of Cujo. Don’t lose hope.

,"I remember your post from a few days ago and I mentioned CBD oil for your dog and to ignore people saying to put him down.  From what you describe, it can be dementia/CCD.  There are many symptoms of it, and I thought you said your vet ruled out physical issues and pain.  My one dog with CCD did get aggressive with certain people, which was completely out of character for him.  Other symptoms followed gradually.  They don't develop all the symptoms at once.  My last girl had the pacing and anxiety but never sundowning like one of my other dogs- he had sundowning bad.  Give the CBD a go and avoid the typical meds vets prescribe, because the side effects aren't worth it.  See if it helps.  I'm happy to give you brands and dosage if you want to message me privately.

,"My 16 year old chi-mix also has dementia and I've been watching its progression for about 1-1.25 years now. Now, this is 1-1.25 years from when she really started showing clearer dementia symptoms (starting to whimper for no reason, starting to pace a bit aimlessly, neurological weakness in her hind legs, being unsettled more). However, even before that, the subtle symptoms  began around 2 years ago (age 13-14 or so). Those symptoms are like your Pom's current symptoms. My sweet girl, who used to let us carry her around like a baby in our arms, and who used to be excited to meet every single stranger she came across (when younger she worked as a therapy dog visiting patients in long term elderly care) , started showing aggression to my spouse and I. She would growl when we approached her face for snuggles, occasionally bite us, starting forgetting her tricks (she used to know a ton), stopped wanting to be handled as much yet was still clingy, starting walking past our house and not recognizing it, spent more time by herself etc. It was a change in character that we initially chalked up to old age or slight body pains. At that time, we got her x-rayed, full body examined, blood panel, etc and she had a clean bill of health so we knew her change in demeanor was not due to pain at that moment. But 2 years later, now today, our girl is very deep and clearly into the late stages of dementia. She now walks in circles, gets stuck behind furniture, can no longer solve food puzzles shes had her whole life and used to previously crush with ease, doesnt seek our attention, and seemingly has lost her volition/intent in her actions...shes almost like a passenger in her own body and no longer in control...I've been accepting that her time with us is coming to end. 

I wish I had recognized her symptoms earlier, when they first began. It was only about 1 year ago when my vet and I started coming up with a gameplan in terms of supplements/treatment/medication to help slow the dementia down. CCD will 100 percent progress in its severity, but the rate of which may be slowed if you take action. Even so, while we had managed her dementia well for the last 6 months, it still took a sudden turn for the worse this last week, even though we have continued the same program. Its the unfortunate nature of this terrible disease. 

My advice for u is to ensure that you are treating all the possible causations that are possibly due to pain (make sure her dental is good, and that she has treatment for arthritis if she has that, have her ears examined for infections etc), and if that doesn't change your dogs demeanor, you should start thinking about dementia as the causation. If your vet is not familiar with CCD, and many are not, change vets. Many vets just think its anxiety, and prescribe meds for those symptoms. I had to find a vet that understood CCD and that would prescribe me Anipryl/Selegeline, which is the only FDA approved drug to treat CCD in dogs. Our girl is also on senilife supplement.  That being said, the most helpful for us has been the introduction of Gabapentin, which both calms her anxiety and helps with pain  If you want a great resource on this topic, considering reading Eileen Anderson's book ""Remember Me.""  It consolidates a lot of info about dementia in dogs. My vet also provided me with great summary about other potential  drugs/supps that we should try throughout this journey. DM me and I'll forward to you. 

The tough part about dogs at this age is that there are often comorbidities. Their vision can be getting worse, there hearing is diminishing, and in turn that also affects their ability to interact with the environment and keep their brain stimulated and strong. My girl got worse as she became more deaf, and more recently her vision has gotten worse which also seems to have made her symptoms worse. She started having more accidents in the house, not only because of her dementia, but also because she started showing signs of kidney disease at age 15.  If you can, try to keep your dog engaged with exercise, training, or some other mental stimulation, to the extent that she is comfortable doing so...studies show that dogs on dementia meds do even better when they have exercise/stimulation. Lastly, please baby proof their environment. Consider putting down yoga mats for traction throughout the house.  As dogs progress in dementia, they started doing wild Sh\*t they never would have done before. My girl who used to train agility, would now face plant jumping off sidewalk curbs because she couldn't judge distance anymore. She also zoomied straight into a wall the other day.  My first dog that had dementia who passed 4 years ago, jumped through the rungs of our 2nd story railing, he survived but it clearly was not good for him.  Lastly, be patient with your pup and yourself and dont be too hard on yourself. Realize that none of the things your dog is doing, is out of spite or within their control, and realize that there will be bumps along the way and that you are doing the best you can to control the things within your reach.

"My dog has dementia/ sundown. What do I do now?
Long post fair warning! 

We went to the ER Vet around 10:45pm last night because we were concerned about my 17-21 year old papillon. The last few days he’s been bumping into things he shouldn’t be and getting disoriented. I was afraid it was neurological as a previous pet had also died of a brain tumor and behaved similarly.

 So we hurried to the vet. After a while the vet came out and said aside from an elevated temperature they could find nothing physically wrong and gave him subcutaneous fluids. 

When I received him back he seemed like my normal sweat old boy. He was alert and seemed to recognize everyone. Even my mom who came to support us. 

Now it’s 6:30 am and I found him standing between me and my husband. Not terribly unusual as he normally gets our attention so we can get him off the bed if he needs to potty. We have a captains bed so it’s pretty high off the ground and he can’t really jump down.

I ask my husband if he could take him to potty and he told me he’d tried two times already and he just bumped around the living room, but did still take him to try again. 

I got up as I wanted to confirm our primary vet visit this Monday and watched him. He did pee on his pad and then proceeded to walk in a kind of circle and start bumping into things he normally wouldn’t. The guitar stand, the kitchen table leg, the pet stairs to the couch. Things that we don’t move so even blind he should know. 

We are now back in bed and it took him about 20-30min of him standing, laying, standing, laying ect. And he finally seems to be sleeping now. 

I’ve never had a pet who was so old they developed dementia and Sun downing. As the vet said he’s in no physical distress. No pain, no heart problems, liver and kidneys are all good. No normal quality of life issues. But I don’t know what to do and how to support my old man! What would you suggest? 

TLDR: how do you help a dog with dementia and Sun downing?

Edit: unfortunately we had to go to the vet and he told me if it was his dog, it would be time. We already knew it was coming but it still wasn’t easy. Said good buy about 30min ago. I wasn’t ready then and I’m still not now. But he was. And he went from being in my arms to into my heart.

,"I went through this with my senior dog. Keep in mind that wandering isn’t inherently bad. A high level of agitation and wandering is what you want to avoid. 

Stick to your regular schedule. If you usually sleep with him in your bedroom and have the door closed, keep doing that. If the bedroom door is usually open, try sleeping with it closed. If that upsets him too much, leave the door open and let him wander. 

You know how people baby proof a house? Dog proof your house. Look at it and say, if he’s wandering around, are there stairs he can fall down? Is there pottery that will fall on him if he bumps into a shelf or table? Just dog proof it. Keep in mind that bumping into things is truly not the end of the world. If it really bothers you, use foam mattress material to create “bumpers” on furniture. Do not rearrange the furniture. That will make it harder for him. Use baby gates as needed. 

Make your bedroom “home”. Have a soft, dim nightlight on in your room or close to the door of the room, so he can see “home” at night. If it won’t bother you, and your dog can still hear, play a soothing soundtrack on your phone or tablet for the night. I would play “Forest Sounds No Loop” on YouTube. Then my dog could hear “home” at night. 

I also added a bed for her in the living room, so if she wandered there but decided to lie down, she had a bed there too. 

She still wandered, but was less agitated, often found her way “home” during the night, and I was still able to get some sleep. Of course I checked on her when I got up to use the bathroom, and often she would follow me back to bed. 

If she was very agitated, I would hear her and would guide her back to the bedroom. In her end days she wanted to be in the living room, so I slept out there with her. 

Melatonin didn’t work for her. She did not tolerate sedative medications and they did not work on her as desired - they actually made her more agitated. 

She did not toilet indoors until very late stages and I used puppy pads. 

Sundowning is something you have to learn to live with.  

She was safe. She was secure. She was confused. But we got through it. You need to sleep to be your best self for your dog and your humans. 

Sundowning could go on for many, many months. Your plan needs to be sustainable. My plan was made in consultation with our vet. 

I wish you well. Pets to your beautiful pup.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1bb3g1w/my_dog_has_dementia_sundown_what_do_i_do_now/#ku788rz,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I'm  so sorry . It's  a frustrating thing for the dog and humans. Prepare to be patient and loving. Mine would stand in corners and get wedged behind furniture and wander with no purpose. 
  If you can keep your dog in an area where they can't have too many things  to bump into or places to wander  around at night it helps. 

For sundowner's my vet said 5 mg of melatonin was allowed. But you need to check with your vet to see if that is ok in your dog's situation. I would give it to my dog at just after sunset/ early dusk do it would kick in. It was not a fix but it helped a bit. Also the dementia med segeline (sp?)  did not help my dog at all. Possibly she  started too late and was too advanced with the canine cognitive disorder.

,"Sorry to hear what you all are going through.  The frequent vet visits, life style changes for everyone in the house, and just slow dissent you have to watch every day.  It’s difficult to really step back and see all of the changes that happen over time as they’re all so gradual.  

We had a house of 4 dogs, all seniors.  We still have our little one Olivia with us but the other three have passed away over the last 8 months.  Our 13 year old greyhound had started having loud barking episodes completely out of nowhere in the middle of the night.  She also lost control of her bowels, which she never had any problems with her whole life.  I could tell there was some dementia or something like it towards the end.  It’s hard to watch unfold, but certainly started getting me into the headspace of it about to be time.  

For all of our dogs we waited until we felt it was time, looking at their behaviors individually for their bodies and heart to let us know.  They will keep showing up for you over and over, it’s your place to make the call when you feel it.  We had in home hospice for all of our pups, definitely was helpful.

,My 16 year old Yorkie mix has early dementia. It’s so sad and heartbreaking. She doesn’t have the sundowners but she would whine and whine after dinner wanting to go outside. So we’d go outside and she may or may not potty then we’d come inside and she’d immediately start whining again to go back outside. It was like she had no recollection of just being outside. She’s on Prozac now which has helped tremendously. We’ve also tried CBD chews which also help but do seem to knock her out. You could ask your vet about an option like that. She’s very easily thrown off - like if we go out of town it takes her a few days to readjust when we return. She also struggles on stairs and has problems getting on the couch and bed. It’s rough.

Selegiline worked wonders for our senior dog.

"Tomorrow I put down my beautiful boy. 14 and a half years old. I lived for him. I don't know what i will do without him.
He's called Jasper and a few days ago we rushed him to the vets with white gums, found he had a 3.5cm tumour on his spleen that could rupture and he would hemorrhage. He also has dementia and arthritis. We have tried every type of drugs and therapies for those conditions and they helped for a bit but we've decided that it would be so cruel to risk the tumour rupturing and causing an awful.

He got me through some really tough times with my PTSD, he saved my life on many occasions. I just can't fathom a life without him.

He was the bestest dog you could wish for, I've had him since he was 7 weeks old, and he has never bitten, been aggressive to anything, never chewed anything he shouldn't, never went to the toilet in the house (even as a puppy). He was good as gold all his life and I couldn't have asked for a better dog, even without professional training he learned how to help me with my PTSD and mental health.

"Said goodbye to my best friend... I feel like I'm drowning 

Oh Molly
You have been with me through so much...Recovering from intense surgeries, bone marrow biopsies, collapsed lungs, strokes, an abusive relationship, faith crisis, multiple bouts of sepsis, suicidal ideation, kidney transplant, grief, loss of loved ones and so much more. You've not only helped me, but every member of our family through some of the hardest times in our lives. 

You always found a way to make us laugh with your goofy antics. 
You showed me love when I didn't believe I was deserving of it. 
You were my constant shadow and confidant. 
You were the reason I got up most days. 
You saved my life, time and time again. 

15 years and 7 months is a long time... But I selfishly wish we had more time together. I use to roll my eyes at people who called themselves ""dog moms"", but you were the closest thing to a child that I'll ever have in this life.

Just like you've loved every version of me, I have loved every version of you. Even this last one, as hard as it's been, struggling with doggy dementia, severe arthritis, pain and health issues. But I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

The unconditional love you've shown me is a gift I'll forever be grateful for. I feel incredibly lucky to have known and felt this kind of love. 

To say I'll miss you is an understatement, and I'm not sure how to live without you. You were truly my soul dog, and have taken a piece of me with you.

,"This was sent to me by a breeder when I really needed it. Please pass it along to anyone who needs its comforting words: 

“All I can say is that I know how it feels when a personal dog dies and that it never gets easier, the older I get. However let it be a comfort to you that the pain will turn into great memories of lessons given to you by your dog; lessons about love, loyalty, happiness, forgiveness, courage, humbleness, and zest for life and most importantly about yourself. I believe that dogs are God’s gift which he gave us so that we have a chance to learn these lessons from them. They are also here to give us comfort and encouragement when we are down. Thus our dogs are not just our guardians, but most importantly they are our teachers. And when their dog’s job is done, then they have to go to doggie heaven back to God. The pain we feel when the dog goes young or old is so great, I know. However, it is only a bargain tuition which we pay for these great lessons, protection and happiness the dog so generously and selflessly gave us.

Cherish these lessons and remember that your dog is not buried in the woods under a tree or in the desert or in the urn, but please know that your dog is buried in your heart where he will live in your memories as long as you do. Anytime you want your dog, he will jump smiling from the tall grass and remind you of the happy times which you have had together and will have forever.

"My dog is turning 16 in a few months. He is blind, deaf and has dementia. What should I do that’s best for him?
The only way he’s navigating is through smell, he bumps into walls numerous times a day, only likes walks for a couple of minutes of the day, and defecates everywhere multiple times a day. He paces around a lot, doesn’t know where he’s going and gets stuck in corners a lot. Today he was stuck in a corner and was crying for me to help, it really was a sad thing for me to witness. I have never heard him cry like that before, he sounded so helpless and lost. 

He still eats well, physically still ok (he still gets zoomies but with no sense of direction) but I don’t know if he is happy anymore. The only time I see him at peace is when he’s sleeping. I thought of putting him down but my mom made it like such an evil thing to do. I shook it off after a while, then came across a thread that said “But extra life no matter what is not always the kindest choice, if that life barely contains anything enjoyable.” and now I am rethinking things. 

Keep note that I have to travel a lot and most of the people in the house don’t care too much for him other than feeding and cleaning him. Do you think it’s best to send him off in my arms rather than wait for his body to fail him?

,"I'm so sorry to read this.  I won't tell you what to do, but I will share my story a bit.

I put my Bessie (11) down on July 7th.  She had Cushings, kidney disease, a heart murmur and the very beginning stages of dementia.  Her final 10 days, she was eating less than normal, peeing every 2 hours or so, diarrhea every few hours and vomiting bile.  Her vet was on vacation.  Perhaps I could have taken her to the ER for more testing, more meds... to prolong the inevitable by a few weeks/months.  But my baby had already had her share of it all, and honestly was never a ""well"" dog.  We adopted her when she was 4 ish. 

I called Lap of Love on July 6th, she was euthanized on July 7th around 11am in my home.   I just didn't want her to suffer anymore than she already was.  And the thought of me going to work and coming home to her passed away, alone... just couldn't do it to her.  She was my best friend... I love her.  So I said goodbye.

For me, when my gal lost the things that made her ""her"", that was when I made the decision. For example, she was always unbelievably prissy clean and dedicated to only going potty outside.

She passed at 17yrs and 4 months, unbelievably healthy except for her cancer which was hemangiosarcoma. I'm proud to say that I did everything in my power to keep her as ""her"" all the way until her last week.

My dog goes to sleep in the comfort of his own home; my other dogs were able to see the passing so they had closure; last, but not least, I don’t feel guilty about blubbering like an idiot on the floor for an hour.  

It’s one of the hardest choices you can make, but if you truly believe your dog’s quality of life has diminished greatly, please consider doing the humane thing and letting them go. 

Spoil them on their last day. Go on one last little trip for them, if that’s their thing. Maybe not a walk if they’re not up for it, but I’ve driven my dogs to the park and the river before they’re passing. Home-cooked meals like hamburger, chicken, whatever. One of my dogs liked tuna, so that’s what he got. And all of them had chocolate shortly before they’re passing favorite toys, and favorite toys and blankets around them, it’s sometimes the best we can do for them.

,"I had the same dilemma a mere 9 days ago.  We want to believe our babies will live forever…or they’ll peacefully pass in their sleep.  I watched my beautiful, fun almost 18 yo doxie become blind, deaf, dementia ridden, fighting off infections, having to be given so many pills & shots, etc.  His body just could do no more - and I was so afraid his end would come cruelly.  I was afraid he’d struggle to breath, struggle to eat/drink, just plain struggle…I couldn’t do it to him.

It is the hardest decision I ever had to make.  And it hurts like nothing before.

But what has given me some solace is looking at his old pictures and videos (over a thousand).  I saw what he once was - how we laughed so hard at his antics, his intelligence, his strong physicality.  Then I looked at the last pic I took of him when I made the decision.  Although I miss him sleeping next to me, crying to me, and his dry kisses, I know he’s okay now, being spoiled by my mom and meeting the other babies whose owners are in this community- they’re eating steaks, guys!

You make the decision, don’t let anyone guilt you into doing something you’re not ready to do.  Our vet was fabulous and yours will not judge you at all.

It was over a year from diagnosis, can't recall the exact timeline, but we finally acted (waited too long we all agree) when he grew weak and couldn't really support himself going outside and was just unfortunately a living shell.  My MIL came for our son's graduation and was shocked at his appearance.  She kindly told us we should say goodbye.  It is easy to let this condition go too long because unless there is some other disease at work, they don't really suffer in the traditional sense with outward signs of pain.  I kept telling myself I wouldn't end his life if he wasn't suffering but him being our first go through end of life stages, I didn't understand the QOL thing like I do now.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gorjhp/dog_with_dementia/#lwlbphy,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"18 years is incredible.  Abby looks so sweet.  I've had dogs with CCD live a couple of years with it and it was something else that they ended up passing away from.  I've never had a dog pass peacefully in their sleep.  My last girl with CCD was having really bad symptoms.  Our traditional vet was no help, but we consulted a holistic vet.  She recommended and guided us with CBD oil.  That stopped all of our girl's symptoms.  You can always consult a holistic vet too and try some natural ways to help Abby.  CCD is manageable.  For when she gets stuck in corners and furniture, you can take away those places.  We used throw pillows and bubble wrap.  Take away the corners.  They make bed rails that are mesh and solid- nothing for her to get stuck in.  

As for when to let Abby go, I’ve put together a page specifically to support people in moments like these, with resources and articles that might offer some guidance.  There's no agenda or promotion- just heartfelt information I hope can help.  If you scroll to the bottom, you’ll find some articles that may bring clarity and comfort.

,"This is so hard, and I’m so sorry you’re going through this. My dementia doggie passed away last year, and we struggled with the same thing. Falling off of the couch, getting stuck in corners, generally acting very confused and fearful. There was no magic moment for us — one day we just “knew” that we didn’t want him to live like this anymore. We knew that his moments of happiness had diminished down to almost nothing, and that most of his waking minutes were spent confused or in fear. 

And on the selfish side, it was becoming very hard for me to keep waking up with him every hour or two throughout the night (he would wake up and just start wandering around the bedroom. And even though we’d made the room safe for him, I still couldn’t just lie there listening to him walking around in the dark, knowing he was confused). 

Deciding to let him go was the hardest decision I’ve ever made. My heart is still so empty without him, and the grief is still very palpable. But I know that he wasn’t enjoying life anymore, and that keeping him with me was for my own happiness, not his. 

I wish you the best of luck, and peace in your decision. Make the most of the time you have left with her, and spend every moment you can making her feel loved. ",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gorjhp/dog_with_dementia/#lwmjv7v,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is Harley, he’s 9 years old now. And his eyes are milky and he’s always pacing and whining for our attention.
It breaks my heart. He’s never been like this before.
We’re thinking it’s the beginning of doggie dementia, and partial blindness… and it’s so hard to watch. My fiance has had him since he was a puppy, I’ve lived with my fiance for 3 years now. He’s such a sweet boy. So cuddly, loyal, confident, protective and sweet. 
I don’t know how to relieve his stress until he goes. He seems so concerned.

,"What a big, handsome boy Harley is!  Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) can be so tough to witness, but I want you to know you’re not alone.  There are two supportive Facebook groups you may want to join: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/CanineCognitiveDysfunction](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CanineCognitiveDysfunction) and [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1273930059288831](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1273930059288831)  I’ve been through this with two of my own dogs, and I know how challenging it can be.  Years ago, there weren’t many treatment options, and vets had little understanding of the condition. Thankfully, that has changed a little (there's still a long way to go) and there are now specialists and holistic vets who are more knowledgeable.

It was actually a holistic vet who helped us tremendously with our last girl.  We used CBD oil under her guidance, and it stopped all the distressing symptoms like pacing, panting, whining, spinning, and sundowning.  There are other supplements and even medications available, though I would suggest trying natural options first if possible.  While there’s no specific test for CCD, your vet can help rule out other causes.  

CCD is manageable and doesn’t have to be a death sentence.  We were able to get an extra, symptom-free year with our girl, and I hope you’re able to find the right approach for Harley too.

My beautiful Daisy had Canine dog dementia hers was rapid on set and it was heartbreaking. It was little things we noticed to start with like pacing and she couldn't settle throughout the day, then she would go into the garden and would just stand there as if to say ""why am I out here?"", then her pacing turned into 22 hours a day and it was full on circling and we would try and break it by holding her to calm her but as soon as we released her from a cuddle she would start her circles again. My other two spaniels would help her regularly with guiding her or settling her as much as they could when she was stressed with the pacing or needed help down to the garden or back they also took her under their paw. We would often help carry her to and from the garden as well so she didn't have to struggle

She sadly lost continence and couldn't find her dinner bowl so we would hand feed her at the end. We could tell in her eyes she was tired and had enough. When we had to make that decision it was the hardest thing we had to do but we knew it was the right one for her.

My vet agreed it was time at the end and also said he thinks she had a brain tumour as well sadly but she wouldn't have survived any treatment so we didn't investigate the possibility of this.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gbjc5x/dog_dementia/#ltnhep8,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Our 15 year old Aussie has arthritis and dementia. She is also almost completely deaf and has trouble seeing in the dark. The hearing and vision loss are due to age. 

We tried a lot of different things but what has worked the best for her is fish oil, a good joint supplement and we loosened the rules on her diet. She is not overweight so if she wants an extra piece of freeze dried beef tripe she gets it. We also make all her meals (kibble) with broth. She has no issues eating but she loves it. 

For pain we use carprofen twice per day and we finished the loading month of adequan injections which we have been very happy with. At night she takes Xanax because she does get anxious and this helps her a lot. 

We just added in CBD and we give this to her on days when she seems more uncomfortable. We went with Ellevet CBD because they are third party tested and they have done clinical trials. 

We also make sure she gets daily walks. They are sniff walks so it is a lot of mental stimulation. She has become very aware and nervous when she cannot find me in the house so we use hand signals - your guy can hear so maybe try commands - to let her know what is happening. 

We talked to our vet at length about medication and she flat told us that using medications for dementia is the same as using medications for diabetes - it’s necessary. The Xanax at night changed her life during the day. She slept better and was able to participate happily in walks and we could tell she was less anxious.

,"Sending comfort and love! I’m so sorry you’re going through this. 

My senior pup recently started to showed signs of dog dementia as well and the vet confirmed this. He also came to us a few years ago with one eye that was going blind, which eventually became fully non-functional (and is shrinking, which is interesting). He very recently fully lost vision in his “good” eye, making him totally blind. For what it’s worth, he’s doing fine in that regard and can still navigate his way around 3 different homes he became familiar with while still having partial vision, as well as two outdoor areas for walks. Otherwise, in new areas, he sometimes is slow and sniffs around a lot, as well as sometimes walks into / off of things, but we are just careful. It’s of course a bit harder to guide a big dog like yours but it can be done. 

The confusion your dog is feeling will likely fade as he navigates the world with his new symptoms. He’s probably under a decent amount of distress, as you suspect, but dogs are super adaptable. All we can do is try to stay strong for them. You can do things like “baby-proof” your house so pointed edges or sharp corners in areas he often traverses are covered or even moved, so he has a clearer path. If he’s whining, perhaps try a calming chew or even talking to the vet about anxiety meds? My dog seemed to do well with CBD calming chews from the pet store. 

Best of luck! You got this. Remember dogs are strong and smart. He may be stressed now as these changes start occurring but he will likely adapt, especially with some help.

Edit to add: Mine also doesn’t get visibly stressed anymore due to losing his vision, and tbh, his dementia symptoms faded though they were initially mostly present in the evening. This may be due to other health factors but I like to think perhaps it was a phase or perhaps he adapted.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gbjc5x/dog_dementia/#ltok9hg,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Dog dementia, arthritis and euthanasia 
My chihuahua mix is 14 and a half years old, I've had him for 10 years and he's truly the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love him so much. The past year and a half has really been hard for him as he has developed arthritis I believe and dementia. He's gone downhill really quickly. Although he is this way, he's not on any medication as my vets never felt like it was any concern. Yesterday he took a turn for the worst and was displaying concerning behavior so I rushed him to the vet and they assessed his quality of life and by their opinion think it's time for him to go. I have been thinking about this for a while as he no longer enjoys anything he does, can barely see or hear, and has anxiety and sundowning. He still seems to want to live and I can't bare with the idea that I would be the one taking that from him. I guess I'm just looking for any sort of advice on navigating when it feels like time, and if anyone has had a dog with similar symptoms which got better with medication. I would hate to put him down if all he needs is some meds. This is the hardest thing I've gone through.

He’s walking again, playing and his mood has improved substantially. As for the dementia, I have seen lots of people on here whose vet treats that with medication as well. I don’t know personally but a lot of people post about it. I would consider seeing a new vet honestly. It’s strange to me they haven’t offered solutions. I would try medication before putting your baby down. Hopefully others will chime in with their experience but consider a new vet.

,"My dog (15, also a chihuahua mix) has similar symptoms and she's on the max dose of pain meds 24 hours a day. They help some but not as much as I'd like. She has some heart and kidney issues that have been well managed, but the back pain and dementia are the things I can't seem to help her with. Yesterday I had a long talk with the vet and they recommended that I put my dog down sometime in the next 6 months, because she's kind of okay for now, but her condition is only going to get progressively worse, and her quality of life is declining. They told me that by doing that, I can avoid the terrible suffering in her final days that could potentially come about as a result of some kind of catastrophic event like rupturing a disc in her back. I mentioned that I would be moving in about a month, and the vet told me I should seriously consider putting my dog down before moving because it's just not necessary to put her through that stress. Honestly, I agree, even though it will be the hardest thing I ever do.

What you described sounds really similar to what my dog is going through. If you're not satisfied and you feel that you need to try harder for him before he goes, maybe you should get a second opinion from another vet. Maybe they will want to try pain meds. But pain meds (I can tell you from experience) won't stop the sundowning symptoms, are often only partially effective against pain, and very likely won't help bring your boy's quality of life back given that the dementia, deafness, and blindness are already isolating him from the world, and he's not very happy. Keep in mind that physical pain is only one part of the equation - mental pain like anxiety, fear, isolation, confusion, etc are all a form of suffering for animals, too.

Obviously I can't tell you what's best for your dog, but I figured I can share some recent similar experience and maybe this will help you feel at peace with whatever hard decisions you need to make.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fjtbqj/dog_dementia_arthritis_and_euthanasia/#lnqh7lc,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I have fostered and adopted many senior chis over the years and have been in a similar position a few times.  The situation with my super senior girl was bleak.  She had arthritis and very bad dementia symptoms.  She was blind and deaf when I got her.  We were considering euthanasia, but I figured I'd reach out to her holistic vet about it first.  Her general vet was no help.  The holistic vet recommended CBD oil and guided us with using it.  Once we figured out the dosage it completely stopped all of our girl's symptoms (panting, sundowning, pacing, spinning in circles until she fell over).  A side effect of CBD is it decreases inflammation, so it also ended up easing her arthritis.  It was like a miracle in a bottle for her and it gave us one more year with her symptom free.  She passed about 2 months ago and I've been trying to help other chi parents since.  If you have a holistic vet you can take your boy too, I would recommend it.  If you want any guidance with the CBD oil, don't hesitate to message me.  I'm happy to go over brands and how to give it.  It can be tricky and there are so many fake brands out there.  (I should mention at one point about 5 or 6 months before my girl passed, she completely lost mobility in her hind legs.  CBD can only do so much and it was more for the CCD/dementia.  We had to add prednisone to the CBD, and the pred gave her full mobility back.

We found our dog Phoebe (~16y.o. chihuahua) running around downtown in the rain on a November morning in 2016. She was between 6-8y.o. at the time.

The vet told us, when I asked for absolute best case scenario, that she *might* improve 25%, with time. After we made the decision, she told us she thought we’d made the right call, the call she would have made.

"Canine dog dementia 
Hiya my springer also has canine dog dementia. She is 16 and it's beyond heartbreaking. She circles continuously when she doesn't circle she needs constant supervision or she sleeps. 
To the parents of other CDD have your beautiful babies tried eating their dinner bowls at all?  My beautiful girl tries to eat hers after her meals each day today she nearly fell asleep in the water bowl. We have two other dogs her little rescue sisters who try to help her in terms of stopping her from circling or with helping her to find her way down the garden.

I think my question is when do you ""when is it that dreaded time"" it's beyond heartbreaking because we lost two of our previous girls over the last two years as well so knowing that we've lost three dogs in three years is so hard but we would never keep her going just for us because we always do what's best for them.

We've never had to deal with CDD before so this is a new one on us. In the past with all our previous dogs we had the normal issues such as the back legs and hips going which impacted them so much that they couldn't carry on and then one had incurable cancer so we knew we were on borrowed time with her anyway but the CDD it's so hard because she's like a dimming candle and she isn't how she was even a month ago and just writing this I'm in floods of tears.

He would walk in circles 90% of the time and would just fall asleep randomly. It got really bad in late April. He went down hill from there. He had symptoms for two years and had been diagnosed with CCD March of 2023. I just couldn’t watch him go in circles anymore and get stuck in corners. His soul was exhausted. It broke my heart. He passed away so fast. He was just done.

"Doggy Dementia
My boy, Ted. He's 12 1/2 years old. He has Canine Cognitive Disfunction...aka doggie dementia.  His symptoms started very subtly. Almost unnoticeable at first. The last month or 2, though, has been really trying on us. His symptoms progressed so quickly.  The sundowning is the biggest issue at the moment.  Ted just howls and whines to the point that NO ONE sleeps. The vet has prescribed a pretty good cocktail that keeps him comfortable for about 8 hours straight. We bought him diapers with suspenders to ensure he makes it through the night without peeing everywhere.

She doesn’t really sundown, thankfully, but she doesn’t remember what the outdoors are for, or why she wanted to go out. She also has arthritis, so going walking isn’t safe because she can no longer get away from loose dogs. But she seems happy, so we’re just kind of monitoring her, and she wears diapers now to try to mitigate some of the damage to the carpet.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1by8ula/doggy_dementia/#kyhvsn3,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Mine is a 100-lb senior Great Dane/GSD. She always followed her older lab ""sister"" and kind of never really had to make decisions most of her life. Sister did something, and she followed. We finally had to say goodbye to our lab just after Thanksgiving (I'm still crying at least once a day but I'm counting it as a good thing that I still have so much love in my heart for her) and it's been an adjustment. 

So now our old lady is on her own, and it's up to her to decide when she feels like doing activities or what she wants to do, or even to choose a direction on walks. We were so worried she'd be adrift after being so used to happily just following and not having to make choices. And she was for a bit, but now she's more self-assured at this age than ever. 

Unfortunately, it does coincide with a bit of sundowning, so this giant dog who's suddenly feeling a little pushy is now huge, pushy, AND a bit confused. 

We are using gabapentin 300mg as-needed, which is currently maybe 2 nights a week on average. If the weather is bad or the routine is off schedule, maybe a bit more frequently. I changed my own routine to be with her once evening hits. Where I used to be doing little tidying tasks around dusk, I've shifted to now be in my cozy clothes and just near her. She's got that shepherd guarding/herding thing going on, dialed up to 11 with the recent change in our family partnered with her feeling anxious at night. She just wants to herd us all together, and then needs to look at us for a good long while to feel like we're all here and accounted for and safe. 

One little random trick is we started ""tipping her out"" at the ""end of her shift"". Basically, we give her a little bit of kibble, like maybe 1/4 cup at most, and take one more trip outside to pee. Then we come back in and thank her for doing such a good job today and tell her she's ""clocked out"". I know it sounds totally ridiculous, but it's like getting your tips from the house at the end of the night, which flipped a switch in my brain, so I experimented to see if it helped her. And most of the time, it does. 

All this to say, you're doing great. They get confused, and just like with the rest of our family, it can be helpful to have a consistent, low-stress routine that helps everyone feel grounded, secure, and safe. Some nights are easier than others, but we just roll with it and do our best in the spirit of mutual love and loyalty to our canine companions.

"help with senior doggie dental
hi all, i just joined this group and i’m so glad i did because i see so many senior pet owners going through the same thing i am. it helps a lot. 
writing this post to ask about what folks have done in regards to when your senior pup needs dental attention/ bad teeth pulled? the vet bill estimate is $3000 and the vet said he would PROBABLY be ok because his heart is still pretty healthy, but yes there’s always a risk anesthetizing seniors and she also said that with his canine cognitive dementia she has experienced that dogs have more rapidly declined after going through the sedation so that’s a possibility? :( 

the bad teeth don’t seem to bother him unless you really try to look in there and mess with his mouth, and he still eats his food totally fine (he’s on the prescription kidney diet wet food.) it does not seem to be affecting his quality of life to the point where the vet feels its an emergency and needs to be done asap, and i also worry about the risks and if his quality of life will decline afterward? just asking what others have experienced. thank you in advance for kindness and openness i know we are all struggling in some way trying to do the best for our pups.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1bkleer/help_with_senior_doggie_dental/,,68,,,,,,,,,,
,"My two cents.

My husband and I rescued a senior at 12 in November 2023. She’s a Shih Tzu mix. Could eat but, her teeth were bad. All needed extracted as they weren’t well kept. Infections are the issue that you need to be most worried about, and the older they get the more risky the surgery and possible recovery.

We had them all taken out and her quality of life is better than ever. Cost was overwhelming; also around $3200 with labs. We aren’t financially well off. I do have excellent credit however, including Care Credit which many vets work with for an extended payoff plan. Paid upfront with Care Credit and some cash, then did a gofundme and recovered $2800. $2200 of which came from a single donor, (TY whomever you were.).

Focus first on the surgery. Then do your best to explore all viable financial possibilities.

Again, just my two cents.

,"I think dentals are super important. But mostly because I started having dental issues and the nerve pain that comes from tooth pain is just so unbelievable. It was so intense that my entire head throbbed. I started avoiding eating anything that wasn't mashed. Just eating an apple would make things worse. Dogs can mask a lot of pain and I would not want my dog to suffer like I did. No way. Never. But that's my personal experience.

It is true that things can go wrong. One of my dogs surgeries had unseen complications that impacted him the rest of his life. We could not have known it would happen. But also I would not do things differently in the future. There are no 100% safe surgeries. That's why everyone signs a waiver.

My 5 year old mutt on the other hand has the MDR1 gene and is very sensitive to anesthesia. I ended up getting her teeth scaled while she was awake.

"Our dog died this morning and I'm Disheartened and Bawling non-stop
Peaches was a PERFECT 2 1/2 years old chocolate lab. Incredibly smart, she would learn tricks and anything in minutes. She would understand us, what we wanted, what we meant, all the time. Obedient. Sweet. Happy. Enthusiastic about anything and everything. Loved our kids. And above all absolutely loved to fetch her oversized Kong tennis ball over and over and over. And that was her last fun and excited interaction with us.

My wife was playing fetch with her, as we always do, yesterday afternoon. After just 15 minutes Peaches stopped, laid down and didn't wanna play anymore. Couple of minutes later, my wife noticed Peaches had an unusual lost gaze, and was not responsive. We rushed her home and started to cool her down with wet towels, under a ceiling fan. Her temperature went normal in a few minutes, but after almost an hour she was still unresponsive. We took her to the vet, they did all they could, but she didn't make it and we lost her this morning. She was taken away from us so suddenly, so unexpectedly. It feels so unfair, like life is just being rude. Its extremely painful for me, for my wife and for our 8 y.o. twins.

Peaches you always loved all of us, unconditionally, non-stop, all the time. You brought joy, excitement and fun to our lives. You were the incarnation of a Noble Dog. We loved and cared for you with all our hearts and souls. We will miss you, forever. Our PERFECT big chocolate nugget, Peach-o-leena, our good dog, our good girl. See you in heaven my big girl.

"Anyone have advice for a dog dealing with CCD (doggy dementia)? We are struggling with our 19 year old girl.
Hey there, everyone. As the title says my best friend will be 20 this year, and she has been lately really been struggling with her canine cognitive dysfunction.  It's been a minor thing for a while now- her being confused at times, not remembering how doors work occasionally, not eating at dinner and looking at her food dish like it's a foreign object but then fussing uncontrollably five minutes later and scarfing down food like you've starved her, etc.  

Then last month we had to make the decision to stop taking her on her regular walks because even though we've lived in this house for 12 years and always go the same route, she was getting upset and acted 'lost' every time we went out and we figured why stress her out if it confuses her.  She still enjoys roaming in our fenced in yard and sniffing for groundhogs and squirrels and such, and is still quite spry for her age.

Lately though, she's had days where she just will not calm down and will fuss and whine and whine for hours like she's very upset, even when all her needs are met and she's otherwise physically healthy.  She gets so worked up and circles and whines, and it's not due to any outside noise or something like that because she is very hard of hearing, it's always random.  Under our vet's advice we are starting cbd oil when she gets very stressed, sometimes it seems to help her and sometimes it doesn't but it's early days so we'll see.

She also has started having occasional accidents in the house.  Sometimes she will have just come in from outside and then you turn around and she's made a mess, and once in a while there is no indication and she's just laying down hanging out on the couch and makes a mess under herself.

Any advice you can give to help us help her if you've gone through this, or just comforting words would be nice.  She is still a mostly happy and healthy doggo, always recognizes who we are and still wants to chase critters outside and beg for treats and ear scratches and has plenty of tail wags, but I know her condition is getting worse and when she has her bad days sometimes I just want to cry.

,"You might want to discuss anti-anxiety meds with your vet, depending on your girl's tolerance. CCD is obviously a pretty disorienting condition for her, and keeping her calm may help nudge her into more familiar patterns of behavior. At the very least, the amount of distress she feels should be reduced!",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/14vwm26/anyone_have_advice_for_a_dog_dealing_with_ccd/#jrjqsku,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Purina makes a food that helps with dementia. It's called ""Bright Mind"". It has a proprietary blend of MCT oil in it. As the brain ages, it sometimes becomes less able to use glucose as an energy source. MCT is converted to ketones more readily, which the brain can use instead of glucose. You can also add MCT oil to her food directly, but you need to introduce it slowly and it can be hard on the gut. Plus, you need the right kind of MCTs (coconut oil isn't going to cut it, use a filtered product with C-6, C-8, C-10 MCTs.) 

There are giant reusable puppy pads/puppy pad-like blankets that you can use to protect your furniture or the floor right in front of the door. Diapers are an option too, but I would wait to use those until she is incontinent while walking around. 

Your old girl looks so sweet. I wish you the best on this difficult journey. May your remaining time together be more sweet than bitter, and may your love for each other buoy you through the end of her days and beyond.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/14vwm26/anyone_have_advice_for_a_dog_dealing_with_ccd/#jrpct3a,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""diaper"" ideas for our Brussels griffon with ccd?
We have a 15 yo bg with ccd.  He pees at night and it's a large amount. We cannot leave him outside or section off the house because he starts barking nonstop. 

Unfortunately the belly bands and diapers weve tried fall off his body.  He has a barrel chest and very weak lower body.  I need to weigh him again but I think 12ish lbs.

Does anyone have ideas?   Most of our floors are wood which makes cleaning even worse.  Thanks all.

"How long did your dog live after CCD diagnosis?
Hi all,

Been a lurker but first time caller to this sub. My dog is a 12 yr old Aussie mix and just in the last week I've started piecing together a string of symptoms that seems like my dog started having cognitive dysfunction about six months ago. She struggled a lot over the summer with the heat/humidity, which was new for her, and also with what I realized was a gluten intolerance, so that was a few weeks of serious gastric issues and illness (honestly thought she might die). About that time she pretty much stopped responding to commands but I didn't really know what to think of it. She is also arthritic and has been ""hitchy"" for about a year but the last couple months she is consistently quite lame and occasionally, for just a moment or two, not weight bearing on one leg. She ran trail 10-milers and half marathons and hiked all summer long in 2021 without a step wrong, and now can only walk 15-ish minutes three times a day max, and will be head bobbing lame most of the time. Her stomach is so sensitive that she can't handle a lot of meds. She was on previcox for arthritis but her stomach couldn't handle it (and I didn't notice a difference).

In the last week, she has started having more nighttime anxiety, neediness, confusion, and hearing difficulties. Also for a couple months I've noticed she is sleeping SO hard during the day, to the point where most of the time I wake her up for walks. She has gotten a little stress-pant-y in the evenings over the last few months but I figured it was pain because she's been (manageably) lame for a while now. But in the last week it's been more anxiety, following me everywhere, not laying down, etc. which feels more like sundowning in dementia. We saw the vet a couple weeks ago before the more obvious symptoms started and she recommended the next step be gabapentin (she just started galliprant), which I will see if we can start next week.

All this to ask, in your experience, how long did your pets live after they had a CDD diagnosis, or strong suspicion? Websites say two years but when I think about how quickly things are happening with my dog, I feel like she has *maybe* a year. And even then, I would hate to put her through another summer after how hard this past one was, so then I think 6-7 months. But is that unreasonable? Obviously we'll see how things go, and she may go sooner, I don't know, it just seems fast and I am trying to do what I can for her to prevent suffering. I don't want her to get to the point of poor quality of life (which I don't think she's there yet but it is certainly declining).

ETA: good grief, I meant CDD not CCD. My dog is not Catholic. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zm7bqw/how_long_did_your_dog_live_after_ccd_diagnosis/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"[HELP] My dog, Eastie the Westie, was diagnosed with doggy dementia (CCD), what can we expect?
My dog, Eastie the Westie, was recently diagnosed with canine cognitive dysfunction at the age of 11/12 (we don’t know his exact birthdate). My mother and I both knew it was coming but were consistently told that we were wrong, but finally the vet has listened and agreed. 

Eastie eats just fine but his back legs have lost all muscle definition and he “bounces” rather than walks. He will dissociate (I think that’s what it’s called, I do this so I don’t know if there’s a different word for dogs) and has been just laying in a corner for hours looking, well, dead. But he’s still affectionate to me (not anyone else, I don’t know why, I don’t live at home, but I live close enough to drive and see him often). He is having incontinence and cannot be locked in his crate because he will cry for hours, so he has free reign of one room, but his incontinence irritates my parents. 

It may also be important to say that our other dog, Bella, a dachshund, was killed by a mountain lion (we live in Arizona) in May of this year. It was traumatic for all of us, but I think it affected Eastie a lot as she was his buddy, always got him outside, and offered comfort, now he doesn’t have that and I don’t think he understands that she’s gone. 

The vet has prescribed him anipryl, so we are wondering what the drug will affect and what to expect as he ages further? 

And if you have any tips to help him or make him feel better, I welcome them. He’s a really good dog, he was always good to me, maybe not everyone else but he lived with me for a while before I got my dog (they do not get along so I couldn’t keep him with me and the situation was never meant to be permanent) so I care for him deeply. I just don’t want him to be scared or hurting. 

We know that his time is limited, and have discussed what to do when he no longer has functions, but we want to be prepared for any behavioral or physical changes that may arise from the drug and the CCD progression as we do hope he can have a bit longer to live a good life. 

Thank you for the help.

EDIT (12/12/20): Thank you all for your help! I’m currently taking care of Eastie and he was so energetic and happy! He’s still having a bit of trouble remembering people so you have to let him know you’re there before you try to pet him or give him a treat or else he nips, but he was very happy and running around which makes me very happy! Thank you all for your kind words and help! He seems to be doing better and hopefully the new diet will come in soon and we can get him on that!

Some dogs will get ""stuck"" in a doorway and forget where they are going, and I just help them into the next room so they are ok. I had one who would get lost in our garden, and we'd lead him out and tell him he was amazing, and give him a cookie.

They also tend to try and go around doors the wrong way, and also when on walks they want to keep going forever. The golden I knew would always collapse when turned around to go home because he wanted to keep walking, and had to be carried home every time. Not sure how it works when they can’t walk very well.

He was so thin that the weight of the diaper wrap was too heavy so puppy pads work better. He was never on medicine for it, he had clorocalm to help with anxiety. We tried our best to keep him comfortable until he stopped eating. One hard thing the vet told us was when he paced and then slept hard it was because he couldn’t get comfortable until he exhausted himself. Looking back we probably should have put him down earlier, but it was our first dog. Talk to your vet often and maybe keep a diary.

We used throws, towels and puppy pads, because he was incontinent but liked to sleep on couch or bed. We did so much laundry, and took him out every hour, it was exhausting.
In retrospect, we were being selfish. And he tried his best to stick around for us. His last night he curled up tight to my husband and cried. He had never shown pain or discomfort before.

,"I just lost my Chihuahua Angel in February I had her from the time she was 10 weeks till she was 19 years old she had dimentia bad. She didn’t even need a corner she would back up to a wall and Yelp like she didn’t know how to get out. She would bark and Yelp all night and I would get up and hold her and she wouldn’t recognize me right away. She was my best friend for almost 20 years she always slept in my bed with me but then she started to walk off the bed and fall on the floor so I had to make her a comfy bed on the floor next to the bed then she started to pee and poop in her bed and she was always a very well potty trained dog so she would be upset and confused when it happened. She was on melatonin at first but it seemed to give her nightmares. We tried cbd oil, Mtc oil and then we put her on anipril but it takes so long to work even three weeks later there wasn’t any change and she hated to taste of it. I knew she was miserable so I brought her to my vet to be put down. I would have rather cut off my own arm but it killed me for her to suffer. What made it worse is they had trouble putting in the IV so she was in pain and fear before she went. I wish I could have known exactly how to make her more comfortable. My only comfort is my belief that someday After this life I will see her again. Dementia is the worst. I hope the anipryl will work for your dog and it is really good that your dog still recognizes you. There are lots of options out there that might help. Specific dog food like neurocare, cbd oil, Melatonin, anipryl, just food for dogs, mtc oil, dog diapers, pee pads, exercise during the day to help them sleep.

"[vent][discussion] Deciding it's ""time"" when your dog has CCD
People often say that ""you will know”... but I believe that when we wait for dogs to tell us, we have often waited too long. “Better a week too early than a day too late” has become my mantra. Even so, it doesn't make the decision easier...the lab we were fostering for my SO's brother passed away from kidney failure just two months ago...going through the grief of losing another member of our ""pack"" so soon is just so difficult to consider...

I adopted my old chihuahua, Monty, just over 3 years ago, from a wonderful rescue that rescues senior dogs and cats from shelters to give them a chance at having a loving home for whatever amount of time they still have. Monty never acted like a dog. Never interested in our other dogs. Never played. I'm not sure if he was in the beginning stages of canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) aka ""doggy dementia"" or if he simply was never treated like a dog. Either way, over the last year or so, he started showing clear signs of CCD. It started with him just standing in front of a mirror or window and staring. Then, he started walking in circles. He lost all ability to find his way outside (or back in), which meant constantly cleaning up after him. We finally had to secure him in one area of the bedroom whenever we leave the house because he will wander someplace and get ""stuck,"" then start screaming in frustration. A few months ago I had to start helping him eat, because he can no longer maintain his balance enough to stand long enough in one place to eat. We have to help him drink water because he usually can't find the bowl, or can't balance enough to drink from it. But he does know when it's dinner time, and demands it! And, he wants to be around us, so when we're home, he wanders in his circular way to follow wherever we go. His ""awareness"" of us, and his interest in food, have kept me from making the decision to let him go. But, the last few months, we had to switch him to a bland diet of chicken and rice because anything and everything gave him diarrhea. But then he started refusing to eat it (I suspect he's losing almost all his senses, so the bland diet is simply too bland). The ONLY thing he will eat now is roasted chicken. And, that gives him diarrhea. So, yes, he's eating. But he's losing weight because he cannot sustain himself on what he will eat. He's down to 5 pounds (was 8 pounds a year ago). Under all his fluff, he's a skeleton. But, he still demands his food. He still follows us. And so, I'm tormented with the decision I must make. I will be going out of town for a week at the end of October. I have already decided that I won't put my SO through having to care for poor Monty on his own, in addition to our other 2 dogs, especially since I have no idea how Monty will react in his declined mental state to my absence (I'm Monty's ""person"" and when he's upset, I can calm him by laying him on my chest). So, the latest I will wait is mid-October. But every single day I wonder if I am waiting too long. Or am I trying to justify making the decision because I am so very exhausted (physically, mentally and emotionally)? 

I'm not looking for answers...I know this is a personal decision that only I can make. But maybe someone out there will read my post and feel some comfort knowing they are not alone, as we struggle as caretakers for these wonderful animals, with making the hardest decision we often have to make...when to say goodbye...",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/cwoidn/ventdiscussion_deciding_its_time_when_your_dog/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"For me personally, the point where the only food he’s eating by choice isn’t getting absorbed would be an important one. Many animals will end up dying of hunger or thirst when eating and drinking becomes too difficult or painful, or when their bodies stop absorbing food or fluids. You can buy them more time by spoon/syringe feeding and injecting fluids, but if his quality of life is otherwise not great I’m not convinced that’s so beneficial for the animal. If he’s not able to absorb nutrients from food he will end up starving to death, and that’s definitely an outcome you want to avoid.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/cwoidn/ventdiscussion_deciding_its_time_when_your_dog/#eydu0kl,,,,,,,,,,,,

"[Help] Think my dog is showing signs of CCD (doggie dementia). Have a vet appointment next week to discuss. What should I be asking vet? Any remedies you've found useful?
My dog is 40 lbs and 15 years old. She's showing some intermittent signs of CCD:


-Gets stuck under the dining room table until I see her there and remove a chair. She ""forgets"" she can back out on her own. That's been happening intermittently for over a year. 


-Over the past 8 weeks or so, she's completely changed her morning routine and goes back to my bedroom after her walk and feeding or paces from room to room.


-Got stuck in a corner Tuesday. Again, seemed to have ""forgotten"" she could back up until I went over and talked to her and gave her the Back command. 


-Intermittently disinterested in greeting neighbors she would usually be very excited to see. Happening for a few months now. 


-Wanders into other rooms (when she would normally hang out with me) and barks. She's not a barker except when playing, normally. Happening intermittently for a few weeks.  


As these behaviors were intermittent and not occurring simultaneously, I had been attributing them to other causes. But when she got stuck in the corner the other day I realized they may well be part of a pattern indicating some cognitive decline. 

So, what should I be asking the vet next week? Are they any remedies (pharmaceutical or behavioral) that you've found helpful with your dogs? Thanks!

UPDATE: Vet said there's nothing proven to delay the progress of CCD.   While that disappoints me, considering her current meds are $150/month and we can't seem to go more than 60-90 days without a vet visit now, I'm glad to know I shouldn't waste my money on so-called ""senior brain health"" supplements.

,"I thought this book and others by Hope Morgan were helpful. One of our dogs has been displaying some CCD symptoms like going into different rooms and barking as if he forgot why he went in there. Our vet said we could try medication but we decided to wait. He also has vision and hearing loss, so we thought that was a factor. We just physically redirect him when he gets lost. We usually put him on his bed because it's a familiar place and then he plops down and goes to sleep. We also have a gate on the stairs and keep the dogs downstairs when we're out just in case.

"Anyone have experience with CCD in dogs?
My baby is 17 years old and back in October was diagnosed with Kidney Disease and she has been showing signs for about a year of ""Canine Cognitive Dysfunction"". Such as circling, getting lost in the house, getting stuck behind things, anxiety, increased aggression, etc.

Between this and her kidney disease sometimes I feel at a loss as to what I can do to make sure she enjoys her final years (fingers crossed for years...) with a great quality of life. Before anyone suggests- I have a Vet appt for her early next week. Nothing is urgent, it's more or less me just seeking some ideas maybe I haven't thought of already!

We keep her on a steady routine, provide water all awake hours (she's in a kennel at night and when one of us isn't home because she paces and the kennel is her 'quiet' spot), keep stress low (we try!), and have her on a good diet for her CKD.

"Canine Cognitive Dysfunction: What's Working for Us
I'm posting to share what I've learned about how to manage Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. I was searching for answers everywhere and could not find anything comprehensive. Even our vet wasn't sure what was happening with our dog or what to suggest. Of course, what works for our dog may not work for everyone but it may give you some hope!

We have a 15 yo lab mix who started having incontinence issues approximately seven months ago. Shortly thereafter she started hanging out in odd places (like under the dining room table in another room when she's usually wherever we are), climbing on furniture (think: standing on top of the dining room table which she had NEVER done before), panting/pacing constantly (would lay down and immediately get back up), climbing into the tub while we were showering and standing under the water (a dog who hates baths), and just would not settle down, day or night. We took her to the vet who suspected separation anxiety.

At first we first tried CBD supplements recommended by our vet which did nothing. We tried another brand of CBD - nothing. We also tried the Thunder Shirt, Thunderwunders, calming music, leaving the tv on, putting something with our scent on her bed...nothing helped. 

Six months ago we started her on ??mg Prozac (sorry, cannot find the records) and 100mg Trazodone which may have helped a little at first but then did nothing. We were getting frustrated, not sleeping due to her being up all night and were concerned about her quality of life. We'd have to put her on a leash just so we could sit down to eat dinner because we feared her climbing/falling off something and injuring herself. We considered it may be the end for her.

After a lot of research I found out about Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and subsequently Anipryl,  which is apparently the only medicine prescribed specifically for Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. Even our vets were not very familiar with Anipryl, but said they would prescribe it if we wanted to try it. After a daunting withdrawal from the Prozac (we learned after having our vet contact the manufacturer that she needed to be off the Prozac *14 days* before starting the Anipryl; our vet initially suggested 2 days which just shows how little they knew - it could have killed her), we started her on 15 mg Anipryl during the day and switched the Trazodone for .5 mg Alprazolam/5 mg Melatonin at night. **This combination made a world of difference.**

Not to be dramatic, but it almost feels like we have our old dog back. She is no longer climbing on furniture, panting/pacing throughout the day. She does have an occasional ""episode"" but they are rare and short lived. She still gets up in the night and will dig in her bed, but she will eventually settle and sleep. We also have her in diapers for the incontinence issue and these have been life-changing as well. THEY WORK. Sometimes we'll double them up (like at night) and put a washable diaper on top so she can't wiggle out of them, but it saves us from having to wash her bed, and it saves our floors & furniture. FWIW she is also on estrogen but it does not prevent her from peeing inside (another thing she'd never done before). 

It has been about seven months since she started exhibiting symptoms and she is doing so much better now. Aside from the CCD she is in great health; even if it only affords us a few more months with her, we are so happy to have found this protocol that works for us.

I just wanted to share in case anyone is having similar issues and is not sure what to do. Sadly we had to do most of the research/legwork ourselves because our vets were just not educated about this disease and how to treat it.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/xw9wtx/canine_cognitive_dysfunction_whats_working_for_us/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I wish I'd known about Anipryl two years ago. We had a 16 year old girl who developed doggy dementia, and we were slow to pick up on it as our other girl was going through treatment for lymphoma. Her thing was three times a day she'd start pacing until she was fed, then she'd settle back down and go to sleep. When she was pacing, she'd often get stuck in a corner or with her head around the leg of a chair. Apparently a common symptom is the dog losing the ability to back up. She also started having problems picking up and eating her food, so we developed a technique to hand feed her. She was bonded to my wife, and up until the very end being with my wife brought our girl peace and comfort.

,"I'm glad the medication worked well for your dog.

My dog also showed CCD, and this is how my vet and I are managing it.

My vet suggested that we try the medication as the last resort after trying all other methods that have less side effects.

1) We changed our food to Purina Pro Plan Bright Minds or Hill's Prescription Diet b/d Brain Aging Care . This kind of food takes 1-2 months to show the effect. Purina Pro Plan doesn't require prescription and IMO is as effective as the Hill's. I do rotate them.

2) Since the food takes a while to be effective, we added CBD oil for more immediate result. But not any CBD oil. Ellivet is the brand that does most of the research on canine CBD oil. So despite the price difference with the human CBD oil, I decided to just go with it.

3) We also added small dose of melatonin at night to calm the dog down as the CCD symptoms tends to flare up at night.

Voila! My dog has been without the symptom of CCD since then. No more staring absent-mindedly at empty space or wall. No more sudden anxiety attacks at night. No more roaming around without any purpose at night.

"Panting, pacing, pawing and whining
Hello doggitors,
My 13yo Aussie, Buck, has recently developed these habits. We're not as active as we used to be, so boredom may be contributing. He's eating, peeing and pooping normally. He's been checked by a vet, but she found no pain, except possibly neurological along the spine. Thinking that it may be anxiety, he was prescribed an SSRI and a pain med. The pain med really knocks him out and he's rather unsteady on his feet. I'm wondering if any of you have seen this behavior. He's also licking his paws and the floor.

"Brainstorming breed ideas for the future
I'm struggling with the inevitable loss of my 15.5 year dog with CCD and want to start looking into getting another when we're ready. I can't fathom the idea of being without a dog and I feel like looking into the future is helping me cope with her decline, even if it feels a bit callous. 

So I guess I'm crowd-sourcing ideas for breeds. I already have several in mind but maybe want thoughts from others on whether or not they're a realistic fit for me. And maybe someone has suggestions I haven't really thought about. I just really love talking about breeds!

&#x200B;

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* No, I've had my old girl since she was about 10 or 11 months old (Chihuahua mix) and at one point had a (best guess) Lab/Husky mix I adopted from the shelter as a senior, who has passed. I also helped train my aunt's terrier when she was young as well as a few of my other aunt's Rottweilers over the years and would dogsit for them at my home years ago. My husband's childhood dog was a Rough Collie they got from a shelter and after she passed his mom got into Greyhounds. He was largely responsible for their day-to-day care but none of them were actually really trained._x000D_  
_x000D_  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* Reputable breeder

_x000D_  
3)	Describe your ideal dog._x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* I want something more on the medium or large side, though I wouldn't rule out a small breed. I prefer breeds that are more biddable and easy to train. Something that does not need to run miles a day but will keep up on long outings and has a good off-switch in the house. I want a dog who won't rip my arm out of its socket to greet every rando it sees but one who can be trusted around strangers. My husband and I love to go to breweries and our favorites are dog friendly, so my dream is to have a dog who enjoys that sort of environment but will remain calm and content to just hang with us. We also have a cat and I know my husband will never be okay being without a cat, so I need a dog who isn't likely to try and eat one. 

_x000D_  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* I love Keeshonden, Bearded Collies, Shetland Sheepdogs, and Silken Windhounds. Mostly because they're all said to be fairly biddable and within the size range I'm looking for. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* I would love love love to be able to compete in obedience and get a therapy dog certification. I love teaching silly fun tricks like wave or sit up. 

_x000D_  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* I don't have experience in any sort of competition but I absolutely want to. Mainly I'm interested in obedience and rally. Maybe even FastCAT. 

_x000D_  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*_x000D_  
_x000D_  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* I'd say at least 3 hours, split up throughout the day.

_x000D_  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  _x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* At least 2 hours of physical activity. I live in a nice area to walk around and live right across the street from a very pretty park I love to walk through. I also like to hike (nothing too strenuous, usually easy or moderate trails under 5 miles at a time) and we have so many dog-friendly trails around us that I really want to take a dog to. I'm not a fan of dog parks, but we do have one in my apartment complex (right across from my unit) a dog run that doesn't get too crowded I would be willing to use when it's otherwise empty or with a safe, friendly dog. I see it more as an opportunity for the dog to kind of sniff around outside the home while off leash in a secured area than the ideal way to burn energy off it. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\*I currently work a part time job in a grooming salon as a bather so I'm already brushing other peoples' dogs for hours every week and have no problem brushing out my own multiple times a week as needed. I have minimal experience doing full haircuts but am comfortable in trimming a dog's paw pads and sanitary. If I got something that needed a more complex haircut I didn't feel comfortable attempting, I would absolutely bring it in as often as needed. 

_x000D_  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*_x000D_  
_x000D_  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* Ideally something in the medium range, like 35-50 pounds but am willing to go larger or somewhat smaller. Husband is not on board with very small breeds (has already said ""absolutely not"" to Chihuahuas)

_x000D_  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* Shedding I'm fine with though I'm more okay with fluffy hairs or dust bunnies then the tiny stabby hairs my current short-coated dog leaves everywhere. At the risk of sounding like a freak, I feel it extremely satisfying to brush or blow out huge amounts of fluffy undercoat on a thick double coated dog. 

Barking I can handle and I realize I may be over-confident at times in my abilities but I did manage to train my once-barky mix to be, well, significantly less barky. To the point at least where she wouldn't bark at any strange noise but would alert for the doorbell/a knock but would settle quickly when asked. I understand that dogs will bark and just prefer that they can be taught to tone it down or stop when called off, if that makes sense or sounds realistic? 

 Slobber I would rather not have._x000D_  
_x000D_  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* Not at all important. 

_x000D_  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*_x000D_  
_x000D_  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* More on the snuggly side 

_x000D_  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* Eager to please

_x000D_  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  _x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* I would appreciate a dog who is alert but whose first response is not ""attack"". If someone is being welcomed into my home, I don't need them to be exuberantly greeting them but don't want to have to worry about someone getting hurt or the dog being anxious at their presence. Neutral is probably the word I'm looking for. 

_x000D_  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* I want to be able to take the dog into public and to get-togethers with family who have dogs so I would rather not have one that is a potential danger to others.

_x000D_  
17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* I would really not want to deal with true separation anxiety, which I know is a concern potentially in some of the breeds I like

_x000D_  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*_x000D_  
_x000D_  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* Right now I only work 3-4 days a week because I'm in school, which is mostly online. With the way my schedule lines up with my husbands, the dog is looking at being alone for a maximum of maybe 5 hours a couple days a week. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? _x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* My husband is much more of a cat person and while he is accepting of a dog, he will mainly be taking it outside on bathroom breaks and feeding it at times I cannot. He mainly wants a dog that is not too small, not brachy, and will listen to him. While I'm going to be the one who mainly works with the dog training-wise, he understands he needs to help reinforce the behaviors. 

_x000D_  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* I'm not expecting to get this hypothetical dog until my current one passes, so future dog would be for a time at least the only dog in the household though I do want to be a multi-dog household eventually. We do have a cat who has lived with current dog all his life and previously also lived in a house with retired racing greyhounds so he is at least moderately dog-savvy. We also have a couple of small reptiles who of course will never come into contact with any other pet. 

_x000D_  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* Not likely

_x000D_  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* We do currently rent an apartment. No weight restrictions, but your expected banned breeds (no bully breeds, Dobermans, Rotties, Akitas, Huskies, German or Belgian shepherds)

_x000D_  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* I live in Southern California, USA and no breed bans. 

_x000D_  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* Summer in my area can get over 90 degrees F. Winters are fairly mild around 50-60 F. _x000D_  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*_x000D_  
_x000D_  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant._x000D_  
_x000D_  
\* With the temperatures we live in, in the past on days where it was too hot to be outdoors, I would take my dog/s to dog-friendly stores (currently live literally right across the street from a PetSmart) and walk them in there. Our apartment itself isn't a struggle to keep cool in the summer due to its position and our central air so I don't feel super concerned about keeping a double coated dog comfortable during the hot months. It's also surprisingly well sound-proofed in that I share a living room wall with someone who has a husky I can never hear unless I'm outside and they have the windows open, so I'm not worried about getting in trouble with neighbors if I do end up with a barky dog. We also do not have kids yet but are looking to try in the next few years.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/18dcjbw/brainstorming_breed_ideas_for_the_future/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Maybe a whippet? They do very well in apartment style living despite their reputation as runners. They sleep and cuddle very well. Short coat, that's a bit of a drawback, but no drool, not too large (25-40 lbs) and they are trainable (for what it's worth male dogs in this breed have a reputation of being easier to train than females). If the cat can handle living with retired racing greyhounds, then it could manage a whippet too. Also a whippet would be quite happy in socal weather.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/18dcjbw/brainstorming_breed_ideas_for_the_future/#kck2vit,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think Border Collie

Almost no trained dogs would be that eager to run up to strangers maybe poodle would fit some are quite excited about guests though exercise almost 2hours would be fine if you keep 1hour max at a  time

You seem like you would exercise them a lot so even more active herding breeds like Border collie( or aussie) may be fine for trainable dogs. If you're getting them as a puppy from a reputable breeder espeicially can get  training in so that I doubt most dogs would try to eat a cat though there are different desired behaviours you will need to train/work on regardless.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/18dcjbw/brainstorming_breed_ideas_for_the_future/#kclt8v1,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My dog will not stop pooping and peeing in my apartment
I have a German Shepherd Husky mix, and she is around 9 years old. I have lived in an apartment with her for over 3 years now. The last few months, she has been pooping and peeing once or twice a day in my apartment. I let her out several times a day, and we go for walks every other day. Does not matter how long she is out or if she goes to the bathroom, she will poop or pee in the apartment. The thing is, though, she will do this for a week, maybe more than stop for a few weeks. I'm taking her to the vet next week to make sure she's ok. But I am getting very angry with her. My apartment smells so bad now. I can't go into my main living area anymore because of the smell. I bought a carpet cleaner to help with this. The stains are removed but not the smell.

"How do you know if a cushing's senior pup is suffering?
Supposedly dogs stop eating if they're in pain or at end of life or they slow down. Mine has cushings and he loves to eat and drink a lot of water. He's also blind and cataract surgery didn't work after a vet promised it would. So he bumps into things a lot and I have kept him coned since he got eye ulcers. The eye ulcers are gone but I'm afraid to take off the cone since January. He also walks in circles and isn't like when he was young but he recognizes my mother well and sits or lays by her side. When I take him for a walk he tries to lunge forward and brushes his face against the grass. He's doing things he didn't do when he could see. However he refuses to eat his medication which include trazadone for his restlessness, a blood pressure tablet, senilife, and vetoryl 5mg. It's hard as heck making him eat these pills. He especially hates the senilife for his CCD. Idk what to do at this point and my mother isn't supportive of me putting him down though she says I should but she doesn't want to be there. My brother supports it though and I feel bad because I tried to get him better and his eye ulcers went away a month ago. He also has periannal tumors due to him not being fixed. His vet said that they're benign by the looks of it but she didn't recommend any further testing because his peeing and the extra protein in his urine could be cushing's or kidney disease but she didn't rec further testing for it. IDK how to measure if his quality of life is fine or not but it also requires me to take him out 2-3x in the morning and again 2-3x in the afternoon and 2-3x at night. I feel it's a lot.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/124h2a4/how_do_you_know_if_a_cushings_senior_pup_is/,,,,,,,,,,,,

what was your decision? how is the little one doing? 💕

"Senior dog urinating literally everywhere
My 14yr old senior female has CHF, losing vision and hearing, kidney failure and CCD. Amongst her medications, one is a diuretic which makes her very thirsty.  I leave water out for her to drink at her convenience. This dog will do her business outside, and immediately come inside and urinate again. I don’t rush her time outside, and have often stood in the yard with her for a good 20-30 minutes. She doesn’t struggle to urinate, and will go 2-3 times in one single outing. Yet, as soon as I bring her inside. She will urinate again. I literally set a ton of pee pads down for her, she will avoid them all. It’s not just my house. She’s done this at others house (don’t take her to other houses anymore because of this) old houses, new carpeted houses, my office… she will urinate on carpet and on hardwood floor. Again, after she just went outside. I’ve purchased way too many cleaning enzymes , bought a professional shampoo machine and rented the industrial kind. It’s become so bad that my younger dog , who also goes outside to potty, has started urinating next to where the older one is going. I have to clean every day, multiple times a time. 

I considered if leaving water out for her was a bad idea. But I think it’s kind of cruel to deny her it right? She takes sips throughout the day. She gets regularly check ups and I report all behavioral changes regularly to her vet. I asked her vets if we could change medications to make her less thirsty, but if I change one then it affects some else and so on and so on. Her primary vet (and also got a second opinion) both said that given her health issues, they believe she still has a lot of life left and to just let her do her thing. I inquired about getting professional training but was told that given her age and CCD, it wouldn’t be of any use. 

Lastly, she was never crate trained because she didn’t have issues with destroying areas before. She went on her walks and went outside just fine. She has no desire to go on walks. She has extreme separation anxiety due to CCD and if she doesn’t see me at all times, she will bark and whimper for hours and hours. Not good for my sanity. Vet prescribed her fluoxetine for that and she had a terrible reaction. Anywho. 

I can’t possibly take her outside every 30 minutes. She won’t use pee pads. Im honestly at a loss of how to get her to stop the excessive urinating in the house.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/vqwk5l/senior_dog_urinating_literally_everywhere/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I’m sorry you are experiencing this. I had a dog with similar issues. Doggie diapers worked well. In his case, the urinating in the home was due to the dementia and not incontinence. And his excessive thirst because of diabetes didn’t help either! But you can def see if medication will help your pup. Anything is worth a try. Also ask about doggie dementia meds. They were suggested to me, but a couple days after vet wrote the script, we had to let him go. I read they can take a while to help so the sooner the better.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/vqwk5l/senior_dog_urinating_literally_everywhere/#ierzl0n,,,,,,,,,,,,
," Hi. I am not well versed on heart failure or cognitive disorder.

 I just wanted to (and I know that you know this already) say that she is not choosing to do this. Her body is failing her, and no matter what you do, her time with you is limited now.

 I don't want to be too grim, and I am not trying to make you feel bad at all. It is just what is happening. I know it is hard to manage things when this happens, and feel free to tell me to fuck right off. I just wanted to maybe help you remember that she is not choosing to do this.

 So for practical advice, cheap dollar store garbage bags. Any couch or chair cushion, or dog bed, or anything that she lays on, put in a garbage bag. Slit a bag down one side and the bottom for larger areas. If you can get some cheap sheets or blankets to 'giftwrap' anything you cover with a garbage bag, that might help, but will mean more laundry to do.

 I am not sure if she will be able to lean pee pads considering her age and her conditions. Won't hurt to try, but it sounds like where she urinates is not really under her control.

"When is it the right time to euthanize ?
Hello guys, sorry this is a bit of a sad post for a Christmas eve.

My old pal named Milou (artesian basset x chow chow) is going to be 16 in a few days, but his physical and mental health has been degrading for the past few months now. He has gone almost entirely deaf, he is pretty blind, he has lost most of his teeth, he is now fully incontinent, he has had a stroke a month ago (which he seemed to have mostly recovered from), he sleeps most of the day and cannot be walked anymore (he doesn't even go into into the garden anymore, most he can do is a few steps before tumbling) sometimes he refuses to eat or drink and maybe worst of all he is suffering from CCD (dog's dementia).

So he isn't doing very well, and hearing him cry out alone for hours on end even if we try to soothe him is just becoming too painful. Factor in the fact that my mother has gotten sick, that my father is only here every two weeks and that I moved to college and you have a pretty grim picture, where none of us can properly care for him.

Still he was truly my best friend for years, we grew up together, and he has become more cuddly than ever, he runs up to my arms if I open them and he never gets enough of hugs and kisses when he seems to be conscious. I just can't bring myself to make a decision even tho the vet has said that it was up to me (my vet is pretty emotionless, great at healing, not at caring). I don't know if the suffering he is going through is greater than the happiness he can still feel...

What should I do ? Do you have any experience regarding this ?",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/rnupvq/when_is_it_the_right_time_to_euthanize/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"FWIW I’ve heard it said that it’s rare to hear someone say they euthanized too early, and unfortunately common to hear them say they waited too long. That has been my experience with my own pets. I was heartbroken to say goodbye to them, but I’ve never, ever felt I did it too soon — and once, sadly, a bit too late :(.

I put down my 16 year old dog a few years ago and she exhibited most of not all the same issues your dog is experiencing. She didn’t enjoy life. It was kinder to say goodbye.

,"I think the main thing to consider is always the quality of the life they're living. If they can't walk, play, see, eat what they like, and especially if they are in pain, it's time. 

Talk to your vet to see if there's anything else that can be done to restore his well-being, of course, but if this is his permanent condition, it will def be for the best to let him sleep before he feels even more pain or discomfort. It's a very hard decision, but remember: you are taking their pain from them and the only ones who will be in pain now will be the ones missing him. It's a very brave thing to do, even though it hurts a lot.

If you decide to do it, i advise you to talk to your vet about the possibility of doing it at home. If that's too complicated, at least be sure that he is surrounded by love in his final moments. If you can, try to be with him. Those things make it ""easier"".

I had to let my best friend go last year around Christmas too (he had very aggressive brain cancer and was getting worse very fast) and and it was very sad, but i know 100% i made the right call. I miss him every day but my heart only has room for love and gratitude, cause he went in the best way possible (in my husband's arms, with me giving him kisses, in our couch -- his favorite spot) and i know i eased his pain forever.

"Coming to terms with having to say goodbye
I think it’s almost time to say goodbye my best friend. It’s been 15 years, he started off as the family dog, but as time passed and my sister and parents moved out, it’s just been me and him for the last 5 years. In the last few months he has been on a cognitive decline and I’m trying to mentally prepare myself for the decision I’m going to have to make fairly soon. 

He’s stopped playing with his toys, he doesn’t react to his name or follow commands anymore. If he’s not asleep, he’s panting and pacing nonstop around the house. He’s started to go to the bathroom in the house whether I’m here or not. He’s even walked through it and tracked it everywhere, on several occasions. His vision isn’t great he’s started running into things, falling down or up the steps on the back porch because he misjudges where his feet are. He’ll get stuck in a random place like in between the chairs under the kitchen table and I have to help him out. Luckily he still eats and drinks without any problem.

Worst of all he’s had 5 seizures in the last 2 months, 3 of them in the last 2 weeks. Which, he’s had seizures for almost as long as we have had him, but to have this many in this short amount of time has never happened. I took him to the Vet and all blood work and tests came back great, she said that it’s most likely CCD and that I should start weighing the good days vs bad days. She suggested giving him melatonin at night to help calm him so he’ll sleep, which seems to work. 

So I know that the inevitable decision is coming, I just don’t want to let him go to early, but I also don’t want to hold on to long and it get worse for him. The more and more I talk about it with family and friends the less emotional I get. I guess that’s a sign that I know it’s time. I just can’t make that phone call.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/wyq3wu/coming_to_terms_with_having_to_say_goodbye/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Behavior issues as dog ages
My parents and I have a corgi. He turned 10 years old this year. We have had him since he was 12 weeks old. I should probably mention first that neither myself or my parents have had a dog before. We've read some dog and training books back prior to getting him, and have tried to instill our desired behavior and traits while raising him, but none of us have any prior experience with raising/training a dog. He's a very sweet dog normally, loves people and other dogs. While he is normally friendly/sweet with everyone, he's developed a very strong bond with my mom as she primarily takes him for walks and probably spends the most amount of regular time with him throughout his life. She ended up falling into this role due to being the only one in the house who doesn't work a traditional or full time job (she's more of a homemaker). I will also add that my dog does show signs of separation anxiety, especially with my mom.

The problem is that from the second half of his life he's developed some weird triggers for aggressive behavior. This started off at first with him getting aggressive when opening certain outside facing doors at home that stick normally. He'll go crazy and start biting the edge of the door and nip/bite the person opening it. In the past couple years though, his trigger/aggression behavior has gotten a lot worse. He started attacking my dad if he'd stand up from the couch while in the same room with my mom. He's bitten him a few times on the hand due to this culminating in an incident last year where my dad had to go to the emergency room due to a bite. After this my dad will no longer stay in the same room as the dog for longer than briefly. We now keep the dog separated from the room my dad hangs out in using a baby gate, while myself and/or my mom stay with him in a neighboring room. 

This worked ok for a while but now my dog has started attacking me more frequently. He started attacking me as well if I'm in the same room with my mom and my mom gets up from the couch or bends down towards the ground to pick something up. This only really seems to happen when my mom is in the room. If she is upstairs or not home, he tends to act normally. He also normally acts fine if me or my dad are with him one-on-one.

This past week it's gotten to the point that if I walk downstairs and into the room where the dog and my mom are, he will get aggressive and try to attack me. I can usually get him to calm down if I stay still and let him lick me and calm down, but then if I try to walk over the baby gate into the other room he will try to attack me again. I have suffered some bites myself and it's unfortunately gotten to the point now where I am scared to walk through the room where the dog is. He doesn't really seem to exhibit any of this aggressive behavior towards my mom, save for the first example I mentioned regarding the door that gets stuck frequently, but none of the couch or baby gate issues happen for my mom.

This has been getting really tough on me mentally because I love the dog and it was my idea to get him in the first place. I would never want to get rid of him. But it's really been making me sad that I am not really able to spend a whole lot of time with him now without fearing injury. I realize he probably needs professional help, which I have discussed with my parents here and there a few years back, but then covid happened. My family is still fairly covid conscious so we prefer to keep visitors to our home to a minimum, as well as keeping trips out to public locations to a minimum. Due to this, I'm not really sure how we would realistically enlist professional help for the dog. We also have concerns due his advancing age that his behavior might not be possible to change much at this point in his life. If anyone has any recommendations on how to approach this issue, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/x5dr25/behavior_issues_as_dog_ages/,,,,,,,,,,,,

This poses minimal covid risk as dog fur is not good at holding the covid virus.

It’s possible the dog has an injury or illness causing discomfort and that is causing the aggressive behavior.  

If it’s not a medical cause the vet can probably recommend something to help the dog relax and not be so anxious.  And the vet will certainly know the best behaviorist in town.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/x5dr25/behavior_issues_as_dog_ages/#in0mhol,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Old dog struggles
I have a 16 year old dachshund, with some bad teeth, a heart murmur, and canine cognitive dysfunction…it’s been rough. 

My pup needs to have some teeth removed. The vet has been hesitant to do so the last year or so because of his age. We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. 

Because of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. 

On top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath. We tried all sorts of vet recommended supplements/meds to help with the pacing to no avail and now are moving onto an $85 bag of prescription hard dog food said to help with CCD, which I’ll need to soften and likely blend because of his teeth. They don’t make it in a soft food. 

He tries to bite me anytime I pick him up to go up/down stairs. So at least twice a day he’s super mad at me. Yet all I want to do it pet his ears and snuggle. It’s been exhausting the last few months. Saying all this makes it sound like he’s miserable. I’m sure sometimes he is but most of the time he still seems to be a happy dog. He does adorable laps around the house when I get home. Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack. One of my favorite things is when he’s eating and his tail does a couple little wags…reminds me of a little kid dancing cause their food is good. 

I feel really torn on taking on the expense and risk of the dental, assuming he’s clearly for it by the cardiologist. Putting his little body through anesthesia seems like a lot. And as shitty as it feels to say, spending nearly $2000 for a dog at the top of his age expectancy is a lot. The vet and I spent a long time talking recently. The conclusion is there’s no right or wrong answer on how I should proceed, either try to keep him comfortable until it’s time (cause I don’t think we’re at that point yet) or try to be aggressive with treatment. 

He’s my little buddy and I hate the feeling that I’m going to pick poorly, that his time is running out, and that he might be in pain. There’s no real point to this post beside to vent, I guess.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/vylus7/old_dog_struggles/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"My old guy before we had to put him to sleep was having accidents in the house turned out to be bladder cancer. The vet informed us that he was not in any pain. I ended up taking him outside more frequently so that he would not have his accidents inside. 

It was when he started getting sick couldn't keep food or water down we took him to the vet and found that his kidneys were shutting down. They talked about possibly trying to hydrate him but they didn't feel sure on the outcome. That was when we had decided that we felt it was to cruel to keep going.

If all the tests have come out good for your dog I wonder if it's Canine Cognitive Dysfunction",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/vdze63/when_is_it_time/#icncjoy,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It does sound like CCD, which we just called doggy dementia.  Our little old man suffered from it for about 2 years, and that last year was pretty bad.  We put little pillows as bumpers all around the house to help out when he got ""stuck"".  He'd do circles around and around the house then just stop and stand there and stare not moving.  He was confined to one floor too, because he fell down the steps once.  We would carry up him up to his bed in our bedroom where he would just stare at the ceiling and not sleep (sundowning).  We had him wear a diaper for a bit then just dealt with the accidents by using wee wee pads and doing lots of cleaning.  While all of this sounds pretty miserable, his tests also always came back showing he was healthy other than the start of kidney disease.  He had a couple of neurological episodes they think were mini strokes, but he always bounced right back.  He still wagged his little tail and loved food, pets and going for walks.  It really wasn't until the last 6 months before he died he really started to wither away.  The kidney disease was actually what did him in and fast.  The CCD just required a lot of patience and care.  We had to change our routine dramatically, but we felt it was worth it.  Kinda like when people have dementia, I think it's harder for the loved ones than it is for the one with dementia.  I watched a family member go through it, and it was very similar with my dog.   It wasn't until he showed the first signs of being sick because of the kidney disease that we knew it was time.  You know your dog best, and you'll know when it's time.  Don't listen to other people telling you it's time.  Heck, if it was up to my family my dog would have been put down when the dementia first started.  If you are really worried about waiting too long your vet should offer a quality of life assessment exam.  I wish you the best.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/vdze63/when_is_it_time/#ico53oo,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Has anyone used Anipryl? Please help!
Hi! Has anyone has anipryl to treat canine dementia? My shih tzu is 16 and a while back, I posted on here asking people’s thoughts to put her to sleep. My initial post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/rf2972/should_we_put_our_16_year_old_dog_to_sleep/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

After some deliberating, my family decided to put her to sleep, both because of her condition and also the impact it has on us to watch her 24/7 to make sure she doesn’t get hurt or soil the whole house. She still eats and drinks and enjoys treats, but everything else on the quality of life scale seemed low. Our biggest reason was that she seems to have CCDE. Even if she’s physically fine, she’s really mentally lost and doesn’t seem to derive enjoyment from anything outside of treats. She’s a 5 on nearly every question in this scale: http://rng.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CCDR-scale-revised.pdf

My whole family is really, really sad about this decision but deep down we felt it was best for her. We spent the past week loving her, cuddling her, and feeding her. That said, I still find myself questioning and wondering if I’m failing my sweet babe, when she’s been here with / for me through so much. We have our euthanasia appointment scheduled for tomorrow and I was browsing online about CCD and came across this pill called Anipryl. It may be common but I had not heard of it and weirdly enough, neither of the two vets we saw recommended it (even when we told them about apparent cognitive decline). My dog is already on pain meds for arthritis and Cushing’s disease, so maybe that’s why? I’m now just questioning my whole decision and wondering if we didn’t try enough, but part of me wonders if our decision is just hitting us and we’re getting cold feet.

Could anyone share their experiences or just provide some encouragement / wisdom during this time?",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/s5y4mc/has_anyone_used_anipryl_please_help/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I just wanted to come in and say my dog is also on meds for Cushings and ever since, she is dazed, constantly shaking, hates walks. All she really enjoys is food. A total shift. Obviously better than prior to being medicated... but a far cry from her usual temperament etc. I spoke to the vet about my concerns and they told me dogs can develop anxiety including hallucinations, confusion as a  as a side effect, which in turn influences their behaviour and habits. I've been considering if this is worth it for her tbh, she's a shadow of her former self and it kills me.

Just my two cents. I'm sorry you're going through this, it really sucks. I hope you find some answers ❤",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/s5y4mc/has_anyone_used_anipryl_please_help/#ht0jeva,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My dog is likely going to die soon. What should I do to make the most of our time together?
My 15-year-old dachshund Cookie has advanced CCD and neurological issues (and a potential brain tumor, but she's too old to go under for an MRI to confirm) that are making her just exist. She never wags her tail. She is constantly pacing around and getting stuck in things. Bright light outside scares her. The medications that we are trying (so far we've tried Prozac and Anipryl) haven't helped, and her condition continues to deteriorate. Last night she slept maybe 2 hours total, and was up pacing around and crying in my arms. We have a vet appointment tomorrow to discuss her quality of life, but I have already started looking at in-home euthanasia options so that I am ready for the worst. While she's not ""about to physically drop dead"" levels, she is merely existing, and has no real joy in anything anymore.

To those who have lost dogs before, what should I do in our final days to make the most of our time together and give her a proper sendoff? I've lost pets before and always regretted not having more photos of them, but I have a phone filled with pictures of Cookie. I just don't want her to pass and me regret not making her last days as happy as possible.

What did you do during your final days with your dog? What do you wish you did? I am absolutely devastated that it's come to this - is there anything that can help soften the blow?",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sghgeu/my_dog_is_likely_going_to_die_soon_what_should_i/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"[Fluff] We adopted a senior boy!
https://postimg.cc/SXL7NL86

https://postimg.cc/xkgJ46M4

Last May we said goodnight to Paco Beanz, who suffered from diabetes, CCD, DM, and heart disease. We had a glorious, wonderful and cherishing 2 years and 3 months together, but I could have had 200 years with him and still needed more time. 

Our girls, Belle (rat ter) and Teddy (min pin) spent most of their days doting on Paco and following him around so he wouldn't get lost or hurt, keeping him warm and safe after a glucose drop, and cuddling him to help with his sun downers. They spent all of the time after he passed looking for him and crying for us to hold and cuddle them. 

We thought they might like to add another boy to the family, so we tried fostering but they never clicked. I think the girls are very care takery and enjoy having someone to dote on. 

Last week we were approved to adopt Pepper Jack, a 10 year old deaf, partially blind, double luxating patella, Grumpo Scruffkins. He HATES being groomed (good thing I'm a dog groomer with the patience to work around that) and he has bad skin allergies. 

For anyone that has adopted a senior that is deaf/blind, I'd love some advice on how to keep his comfortable and be able to interact with him. He does get started so I make sure I always step heavily before I try to approach him, and I have the stairs blocked off, but he doesn't seem to know how to do stairs anyway.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/llc41z/fluff_we_adopted_a_senior_boy/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"What a precious fella! 

If he isn't getting startled too badly by you approaching him I would continue the route of making sure he is feeling your footsteps. What I would be conscious of is to make sure when you approach him, that you are stepping heavily enough that he acknowledges you before you reach out to touch/interact with him. While you didn't mention when you adopted him, it could be very possible he is still adjusting and some of that startling behavior will go away some with time and him getting use to the movements and ""sounds"" of your home.

With his knees I wouldn't be too worried about him doing the stairs, especially if he doesn't seem interested or like he doesn't know how to do them, and it's always better to err on the side of safety with senior dogs who do have some health problems.
Thank you so much for adopting, though! He's a cute little bugger and it seems like he's fitting in well. :)",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/llc41z/fluff_we_adopted_a_senior_boy/#gnq98md,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dog dementia - struggling to know when it's time
Hi everyone. 

I know this topic has been posted a lot. I've spent the last several weeks reading every post and article I can find but even still I am struggling so much trying to decide if it's time to let my boy go. And I think I just need to talk about it so I'm sorry if this isn't the right place.

I adopted my pup from a shelter about 7 years ago. They think he was 2-3 but I think he was quite a bit older. I never really understood the term ""heart dog"" until I found him.

He's never had it easy. He was mean and cranky and hated everything in the world except for me. He had health issue after health issue, ear infections, utis, and then diagnosed with cushings about a two years after I got him.

He never really acted like a normal dog. He didn't really play. His tail hardly wagged.

But his eyes were so lively. He'd spin and dance when I woke up each morning because the day had begun and that meant pets and snacks and love.

My life revolved around him and I was happy to let it. He started slowing down about two years ago. He was getting injured more often and had arthritis but couldn't take pain meds because of his cushings.

Gabapentin helped. I moved this past summer and he was so happy to have a yard that was all his. But in the fall he started walking in circles around the dining room table. I thought he was just restless because he couldn't spend as much time outside. Then he started vocalzing. Groans and cries and little whimpers. After years of no accidents inside he started peeing and pooping everwhere. The circles tightened up and he would spend hours at night treading the same paths, restless and crying. His eyes clouded and his hearing started to go. He missed jumps and bumped into walls.

It has gotten worse and worse. Multiple accidents a day. He will step in poop and track it all over the house. He stopped sleeping for awhile but some meds got him better nights.

More recently he has started circling in the day too. He is either asleep or circling. He eats but doesn't get excited like he used to. 
But he still dances every morning when he sees my eyes open up. Every time he hears my voice his ears perk and he looks around trying to find me. 

The quality of life scales never seem to help because he never acted like a normal dog. A ""good"" day is an hour or so of pacing. A bad day is hours of crying and circling.

I know his time is nearing. I also know Im frustrated and sad and tired. I feel like I can't make the decesion because my emotions are all over the place. One moment I decide it's time and the next I'm beating myself up for even considering it and convince myself its the frustration speaking. I told myself I wanted to keep him going till spring and see if the sun brings a little of him back to me. But then I see him pacing night after night and I wonder if I'm being cruel. 

I love this dog more than I have ever loved anything. It's just me and him. But when he goes, then it's just me and I am terrified of that.

I'm not really sure what I am looking for. Advice, if you have it. Your stories, if you're willing to share. Thank you for listening",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/11lhi0e/dog_dementia_struggling_to_know_when_its_time/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I'm crying right now.  Honestly, that's not an exaggeration.

My wife and I made the decision last week to have our girl put to sleep.  We had a vet come to our home, because it hurt her to get her in the car.  It was Monday.  Yesterday.  She wasn't there this morning, or when we got home from dinner.  

We had almost 13 years with her.  She was a newfoundland.  We moved into our house 5 and a half years ago, she was nearly at her life expectancy and I thought it would be nice for her to have a big fenced in yard for her last year or two, maybe 3 if we were lucky.  

We got 5 and a half more years.

Recently she has been having more and more mobility problems, there have been a few days where she couldn't get up, for hours or more.  She has spent almost every night of her life in or next to our bed, and she hasn't even made it in the room half the time, or it took her half the night to make it there.

One morning my wife called me, it was last Monday. She couldn't get up.  I was 3 minutes from the house and I turned around and came back home.  She was... flailing, her legs were moving but not in a way that would get her off the floor.

I'm still not sure if it was arthritis or something else, it really looked to me like she had forgotten how to stand up for a little while.  She panicked, she didn't understand why she couldn't get up.  

We both spent a day or two processing it.  Even on a good day she can barely stand up.  She can't make the single step onto the deck, she has to walk through the mulch and around the back to get back to the door.  We decided to have her put to sleep.  It was scheduled for after the weekend.

She had a weekend full of pets and love. And an obscene amount of treats, as my wife put it to the vet.  On Sunday night we got her a double cheeseburger and a medium fry from mcdonalds, it's her favorite meal.  She always got a cheeseburger on her birthday but she didn't quite make it this year, it would have been March 25th.

Yesterday I held her head as she was put under sedation, until the vet and his nurse administered the actual drug to end her life.  It was possibly the hardest thing I've done in my life

I think, that you know, deep down, when it's time.  I think we can tell when they would be better off without the pain and hardships they are going through.  I couldn't bear to see the panic and the pain on her face another time.

I don't really have any advice, and I appreciate the opportunity to share what I'm going through, I hope it helps in some way.  She was the best dog I've ever known, she helped raise all my nieces and nephews, although we never managed to have any kids ourselves.

I believe we made the right decision at the right time.  Even though I am distraught, and grieving.  I hope you can make peace with whatever decision you make.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/11lhi0e/dog_dementia_struggling_to_know_when_its_time/#jbcpdln,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I recently put my dog down, she was 12.5 and had dementia and arthritis. She could handle some gabapentin, but anything else would make her vomit, nauseous, and have no appetite. I think she started having cognitive issues about a year before she was diagnosed, and she lived about 3 months after diagnosis. She didn’t have the accidents, but she had a lot of pain, pacing, crying, anxiety, and forgetting commands and schedules. In her last few weeks, it got to the point where every day around 4 pm I would brace myself for hours of inconsolable crying and whining. Some days were okay, but it was mostly heartbreaking bc while she was crying she would look so confused and stressed.

Like you, I hemmed and hawed a lot about when it was time. But then I realized that if there are so many moments that seem like “it’s time,” then it’s probably time. The good moments became fewer and fewer, and the bad moments increased. And it wasn’t fair to her to suffer. I am so devastated without her, I knew it was coming for a while but the reality is so hard, but I’m glad that she could go out without deteriorating too much.

It’s never an easy decision, but it sounds like your pups quality of life is declining. No one can like stepping in accidents throughout the day, or getting stuck in circles. I had a vet come to my house for the send off, and it made a huge difference in the experience. I hope that can be an option for you.

There’s a Mary Oliver poem that I really love:

To live in this world,  
You must be able to do three things:  
To love what is mortal; To hold it

Against your bones, knowing  
Your own life depends on it;  
And, when the time comes to let it go,  
To let it go.

ETA: For others who might read this post, the common advices of ""you'll know"" and ""they stop eating"" were not applicable to me. My always picky eater dog became a food vacuum in her final months. She asked for food every few hours and ate it enthusiastically. Also, of course she slowed down a lot, but she always wanted to go for a walk (though she eventually could only go about a block, very very slowly), she always wanted to cuddle on the couch, and she still liked chewing her bones and toys. But, she would fall or trip more frequently, had trouble walking well, lost hearing and training (leash manners, commands, etc.), became less friendly to other dogs (esp. puppies), and her separation anxiety came back so I couldn't leave for long.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/11lhi0e/dog_dementia_struggling_to_know_when_its_time/#jbcpl0r,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I just had to do this two weeks ago. My beloved, beautiful, best boy was diagnosed with diabetes and pancreatitis 4 years ago. He took it like a champ, like he did everything that he went through. About a year ago he started acting off, he started barking a lot, and not in the playful way, he started pacing; not out of the ordinary when looking for my dad, but it seemed a little off to him. He then started to have seizures, and at first the vet and us both thought that it was low blood sugar, as when we took his blood sugar it was low...and then one day when we took him to get a check up, he had one...and his sugars were fine. The vet did some tests and came to the conclusion that there was a very small tumor in his brain, but it was pressing on just the right spot to cause the seizures. The pacing got worse, the barking and whining got worse, his eyesight started going, which frightened him to no end. His hearing started to go and the only thing he could rely on was his sense of smell. With this the pacing got worse, and he was now bumping into things. He would go to the door to be let out, and then immediately forget why he was there, and would bark and act terrified as if forgetting where he was. We had to help him outside, and once out he would remember what he needed and do his business. A week before we made the hard choice, he stopped eating willingly, he would eat, but it was as if he didn't understand how to do it anymore. We were feeding him with a spoon. (which luckily he had learned to do when young thanks to my dad sneaking him some mashed potatoes off the table lol) He resisted his needles, which he had never done before; standing there and trying to walk away when he knew it was coming...He was telling us he was done, that he wasn't wanting to do it anymore, and that he couldn't handle it anymore. We knew at this point he was slipping. We made the hard choice to take him in to the vet while he still remembered us and recognized us, and while we still recognized him. 

You will know when it's time, the signs will all be there, and even your friend will tell you when he's done with it and that he needs to go. It will tear your soul out your throat and rip your heart out from between your ribs, but you will know when it's time and he will thank you for it in the end to be let go with dignity and love; and while he will still know who you are.

,"Trying to decide the 'right' time to euthanise a much-loved pet is almost impossibly difficult.

My 'decision point' has always been when they are clearly suffering to the extent they no longer enjoy the activities they used to love, but having said this - I've been wrong, and then decided to cancel the vet coming to my house, as my dog started showing interest in something. This has happened a few times....

I feel for you.  Trying to make the impossible decision to end the life of a much loved pet is always a living nightmare.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/11lhi0e/dog_dementia_struggling_to_know_when_its_time/#jbdhgvs,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The circling is making me think this could be vestibular.  Same thing with the accidents.  How is his eyes? Are they darting up and down or side to side rapidly? If so, that could indicate nystagmus.  Before you make that call I would take him to the vet.  It could be an episode of Vestibular Disease or “Old Dog Disease” because it usually impacts elderly dogs.  Recovery from it can be slow, it can take 6-8 weeks with proper treatment but it can be treated.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/11lhi0e/dog_dementia_struggling_to_know_when_its_time/#jbe5j8c,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"My pup was 16. He was my first pup. I got him at 1 year old when I was 15 in high school.

He seemed to develop dementia in late 2019-2020. Previous Vet put him on trazodone to help with his severe separation anxiety. He really started to decline around the end of 2022. He started having severe mobility issues, slumping to one side while walking or standing , wobbly walking, and having occurrences of falling over and not being able to get back up (almost like he was having a seizure but it was never confirmed). Lost most of his hearing. He also started loosing a lot of weight even though he was eating way over the recommended amount of food and being pretty sedentary.

He spent most of his days sleeping and when he wasn’t sleeping he was eating his food and then playing (doing what he could) with his little sister (puppy shiba) in the yard. They used to chase each other around a lot, and she was very gentle with him which was amazing because she just seemed to understand he was older, but towards the end he wasn’t really up to much play. 

Comparing him in videos from a year ago to the present, he was like a completely different dog. A year ago he was still very active, alert and somewhat up for a chase at times. And sassy! Would growl when I had to give him eye drops for his old man dry eyes. But when he declined he started declining fast. He was listless and just living life without much meaning. He wasn’t enjoying being a dog anymore. He would still eat but seemed like he was just going through the motions. And come night time, he would pace and cry out at times. I had to keep him in an exercise pen to keep him contained so he wouldn’t hurt himself or get stuck somewhere. 

He also started having frequent accidents and they became more and more frequent. Potty training pretty much disappeared so he had to live in a belly band as well. And the kidney disease didn’t help. I cleaned up his little area every night after work because he would without fail have a poop accident in there, and then pace all over it so it was everywhere. 

The last straw was when I came home with my other pup from an outing, and he was stuck on his side laying in poop, I’m sure he had cried out a few times but I wasn’t there to hear it 😭. He didn’t have the strength to pick himself back up, so he was just laying there in silence until I returned. I called the vet the next morning to make his appointment. I gave him a week to idk maybe prolong the inevitable? I think I just wanted to make sure it was the right choice, but as the week went on, I knew it was. That week gave me time to mentally prepare, I took a paw print from him to have a necklace engraved. Bought a memorial frame and ordered pictures and acrylic blocks with his photos inside. Gave him one final bath and on his final day I made sure he got to say goodbye to little Artemis (they touched noses 😭) . It was the hardest day ever and no amount of mental preparation would save me from bawling my eyes out on the way to the vet and at the vet. 

In the end I know it was the right choice, I didn’t want him to suffer. I’m sure it would have only gotten worse as time went on. He went peacefully in his sleep on January 31st. That’s all I could ever ask for, is a peaceful end for him.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/11lhi0e/dog_dementia_struggling_to_know_when_its_time/#jbd1mct,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Have you asked a vet to confirm that your dog has dementia, rather than a physical problem?

I ask, as recently I brought the vet to my house as one of my dogs was suffering from incontinence and, possibly dementia, but blood tests revealed another problem.  After a week or so of tablets, she improved ENORMOUSLY!

The 'funny' thing is that even my vet thought her incontinence was due to old age, but a week or so later, the incontinence has ended, and she's very lively again!  I'm not about to try to wash her again (she was paralysed by fear, hence my thought of dementia), but there was a physical problem to explain her incontinence.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/11lhi0e/dog_dementia_struggling_to_know_when_its_time/#jbdix57,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I’m sorry you are going through this. Of course only you can make this decision but Id suggest A) gauge it by the standard for what you’ve known his quality of life to be since you can’t use the scale. B) gauge it by your quality of life too! I was in a similar predicament with the exception that my dog was a happy lil angel from day one. At the end he had several health issues and then dog dementia came on top of it all. My vet said it’s about my quality of life too. They can’t go to a doggie nursing home so things like incontinence that may be no big deal in people, is a big deal for pets. Are you delaying the inevitable? Are you keeping him around for you or him? These are things to ask yourself. But either way it’s hard. It hurts.

,"Hi friend, I am in a very similar position myself at the moment. I have a dog who is 14, diagnosed a few months back with dementia. She is also on gabapentin but also trazadone to keep her calm. The meds work well. However, have had to steadily increase as she became accustomed to them.

There will never be a right time. I have been in the animal (welfare and care) industry for 11 years. Even I have been brought to tears by her whining and inconsolable moments. 

Things I am looking out for to know when the time is right (enough): eating and drinking habits, toileting, stability in herself, overall happiness and attentiveness, any unexpected aggression (from confusion or startle). I also have another dog and I am looking out for his behaviour (is she making him anxious? Is he going to act out onto her when she is not being herself?)

The bottom line is, there is no right time. I have always told myself that it would be better to be too early, than too late. When the good begins to outweight the bad, I know it will be time. It is also fair to consider yourself in these moments. When it becomes too much for you, there is no shame in making the call. Why? Because your dog deserves to not have an unstable or frustrated owner during their most vulnerable moments.

I feel like my input here has not been overly helpful. However, I also just wanted to let you know that you are not alone. I am here feeling the confusion, the heartbreak, the frustration and the happiness all wrapped up into one.

All the best for you and your beloved.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/11lhi0e/dog_dementia_struggling_to_know_when_its_time/#jbdpank,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"My girl, Cora, had Alzheimers and had no increase in aggression. 

For food, I put smelly stuff that she loved into her food bowl. Bacon was one of her favorites. I also did home-cooked meals for a year or so, with chicken, rice, and veggies. (ALWAYS talk to your vet before home-cooking meals. You want to make sure your dog is getting the nutrients she needs.)

I also used doggy diapers. We still went outside on a routine, but, with her cognitive decline, she didn't always recognize when she needed to go. I bought a simple pen and some small animal snap-together fencing ([like this](https://a.co/d/1r3rIMj)) to keep her contained in rooms. She liked to pace around. And I lined the floor with blankets that could be tossed in the wash when an accident happened.

It's hard taking care of anyone experiencing cognitive decline. Talk to your vet. If they have no experience with canine cognitive decline, ask for recommendations.

Above all, be patient with both her and yourself. This is frustrating for her, too. Do what you can to enjoy this time together. Tell her everyday how much you love her. If she enjoys being held, hold her often. If she'd rather not, make sure she has a bed out of her favorite materials, in a warm place away from stressers.

Evaluate her quality of life frequently. I should have helped my girl leave this world sooner, but, instead, she spent an hour in my arms, fighting to breathe, before she passed away. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone. And evaluate your quality of life, too. Don't lose your life in caring for someone else's. You matter, too.

I wish you and her all of the best. Feel free to DM me if you need some moral support or to vent. It's not easy, but I never regretted the almost 2 years I spent helping my dog manage Alzheimers. She was an amazing and deserved the best that I could give her. And she was relatively happy right up until the end. She taught me new levels of compassion and patience, and her absolute trust in me was humbling.

[This is her](https://i.imgur.com/izwPpWn.jpeg) in all of her shaggy glory, rocking her diaper, at work with me. This photo was maybe 6 months before she passed away. It'll be 3 years this summer since I lost her. I still miss her every day. Her impact on my life will never be forgotten.

Mostly she just does A LOT of pacing, typically in circles. I give her over the counter hemp based calming chews and she chills from the pacing. If I don’t she will do it for hours until she literally is exhausted then she has a hard time walking to go potty. It’s a whole thing…

My rule with my fuzzy family is that I don’t make any decisions for my convenience. Whether it be because it sucks cleaning up turds or because I don’t want the heartbreak of letting them go. So you have to evaluate the situation, is your doggo still loving life?

"My elderly dog with dementia has found some comfort
Hello, my 17 year old Bichon Frise has been going downhill in health for the last 2 years.  She appears to be blind and has all the classic Dementia signs.  Each day is a struggle because she is constantly walking around and does not seem to ever find whatever it is she is looking for and she appears to be constantly stressed.  It breaks my heart and I cannot find anything that will soothe her or put her at ease… until my husband did this.  He took two squeaky toys that both of my dogs completely ignore and he laid them over her neck in the shape of an X as she laid in her bed.  She instantly falls asleep and rests.  Does anyone know why this gives her comfort??

"Need Dog Bed Recommendations for Dementia Dog That Eats EVERYTHING

"[DISCUSSION] To those owners who are worrying about how they will cope when it is time to let their dogs go.
I’m writing this now as I have not long just got past the first year anniversary of my boy not being here.

So I am you one year in the future.
 

If you are starting to have your doubts about quality of life; if you are starting to watch the things your dog does getting less and less; and most importantly, if you just see from the look in his eyes, then you will know it’s time.
 

I kept my boy going, admittedly for my own benefit, for maybe a month more than he wanted to. I spent hundreds of pounds on his tablets and specialised food and kibble, and puppy pads, and time off work. At that time, I would have paid a million pounds just to have him well again, but unfortunately we as owners know that their life is not infinite. He was 15 years old and had Canine Cognitive Dementia. 
 

When it's near the time, you will sit quietly with them, you will wonder what they are thinking, are they happy, are they lucid, do they understand your pain, do they know it’s time and just waiting for you to know it? All these things and more will go through your head.
 

But the one main thought will be “How will I live without him?”
 

The answer; you will. I promise you of that.
 

You will spend the first few hours after getting back from the vet, just walking around your house like a zombie. You will pick up their puppy pads and newspapers and washable rugs and put them all into a bin bag. You will pick up his bowls and put them in the sink. You will hold his bedding that has his smell on it and cry into it.

You will sit down and not even notice what program is on tv as you just feel numb inside.
These things are absolutely natural and are needed. You need time to process. 
You don’t need people keep messaging you asking how you are (to which you answer ‘Fine’ just to get rid of them) or coddling you. You will cry that night. You will cry randomly for the next month.
 

The next day you get up to do the normal routine (waking the dog, checking the bedding, letting dog into garden, binning the doggy diaper, getting the special food ready) then you burst into tears because that routine isn’t needed now. So you just sit. You sit and think too much. You’ll find a toy or ball behind the sofa/under a cushion and you will hold it and cry. 

 
After a few days you start dragging yourself out of bed with a bit less sorrow; you’ll say to yourself that it was cruel to let them go on, you did the best thing, it’s what they would have wanted, etc. You’ll say anything to validate your choice.
But you don’t need to validate it – never, ever feel guilty for making the hardest, heart-breaking, yet loved and loyal decision you will ever make.
 

A week later you start doing your normal everyday things, but always with the feeling they are just about to walk in the room, so you keep looking around, keep reminding yourself they are not there. You hate checking Facebook because the Memories comes up and it’s all pictures of your dog over the years.
 

A month later, you have some normality. You can talk about them to people but only for short conversations – too long and you just choke up. But you will laugh about the daft things they did and for the first time, you start to smile when talking about them. It isn’t as hard checking Facebook Memories now – you smile at their antics that you posted, and notice by all your friend’s comments just how much he was loved by everyone.
 

Two months later, you realise you have made it through one of the hardest moments of your life, and though you will never forget about your dog, you start feeling like you are coping. Then you feel guilty for coping. Then you berate yourself for feeling guilty. These are things that will happen. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions. You will promise yourself never to have another dog as you can’t go through this again.
 

Six months later, you have a new routine, you still feel guilty that you can go for a night out and not worry about the dog, or that you could stay over at a friends and not keep checking your internal doggy camera.
But you still can't watch movies like Marley & Me without breaking down in tears. Do it. Let the emotions out. Nobody says there is a time limit on grief.

You still promise you will never get another dog because it’s too raw.
 

9 months later you are still getting Facebook Memories but this time you share them again, saying about the fabulous day out that was with them, or the silly thing they did that day. You smile. This time you don’t feel guilty about smiling. You know he’d want you to be happy.
 

12 months later, the Facebook anniversary post of his Rainbow Bridge announcement looms and you don’t read it that day. 


Not long after, something niggles at the back of your mind – he’d want me to have another dog. To rescue a poor pup and for the pup to have the same love as he had, play the same games, go to the same parks and walks, maybe play with some of his toys that you have put away in the back of the wardrobe because you just couldn’t bear to throw them out.

And you would wonder and doubt – could you? Would you?
 

And before you know it, there are the tip-tip-tipping of dog nails across your laminate wood floor, there’s laughter and excitement and pure love at the antics of this new dog.

 
And though you don’t see them, your dog sits in the corner watching all of this and smiling those bright almond eyes, knowing this new pup is going to have an amazing life.

Thank you so much for all the Awards - and all of the lovely comments.
I'm glad this may help some people (even though we never want to be in this position!) and I always say ""I'll get past it, but I'll never get over it.""



For those who still have their dear friend with them, here is some advice I gave online to a friend last month:


Make sure to take lots of photos and videos.
Although I have tons of photos I wish I took more videos of him. 

You miss the little whines, growls, barks and howls.


Please just do whatever he wants until he feels its time. If he wants McDonald's, he gets McDonald's. If he wants a toy, he gets to choose lots of toys. 

It's these fun memories that will keep you going when the time comes.


And this may seem weird, but snip off bits of his fur from different parts (neck, back, tail, etc) and keep them in little baggies. If you then wanted to get a memorial ring or pendant made, lots of online crafters can put the fur or ashes into gorgeous glass creations.

(And if cloning ever becomes affordable, you have him ready!)


Also get an imprint of his pawprint. You can get kits online, or some pet shops may be holding a paw print day (or something similar) where you can take him to the event (if covid permits, of course) and have him stand on a piece of clay that then gets shaped to a heart or a square and its a lovely decorative reminder. 

Or even just an inkpad and lots of paper at home and do all his paws and let him wander around, and you have personal art pieces! Lol


Make sure to take lots of selfies with him - if my camera roll tells me anything, I mostly took pictures of my dog sleeping! You'll enjoy looking over the photos after some time, and you can print them out to keep.


Also, and again another weird one, if he has a favourite blanket or towel, keep it in a sealed bag (one of them vacuum sealed bags are great) afterwards, because sometimes you just have to hold something with their smell.


I have heard that Build A Bear stores let you put your dog's fur or ashes into one of their bears as they stuff them. 


If possible, you may even be able to record your dog's bark/howl onto a voice box (play it from your phone to record to the voice box insert, or upload the file if doing it on an online store) and they will insert it into your chosen bear.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/lwl15u/discussion_to_those_owners_who_are_worrying_about/,,,,,,,,,,,,

We had someone come to the house so he could be at home with us during the process. I was a zombie mess for months and still am when I think of him. He was my everything.

Do be aware that late stage dementia will be a valid reason to euthanize when the meds stop working, and they eventually will.

"[Discussion] I can't say goodbye to my 16 year old dog
 

We have been together since she was 8 weeks old, Aggie and I. She has been by my side every day, at work, at play, on adventures, cuddled up on the sofa watching TV at night…. I couldn't possibly love her any more than I do.  
 

I always hoped that she would pass away peacefully in her sleep one night (don't we all). That I'd find her one morning at peace. I would cry for days and days but it was her time and she had lived a very happy life where she was loved and treasured.

The above scenario now seems heartbreakingly unlikely. Instead I have a dear little dog who has severe dog dementia and I am racked with guilt at watching her struggle through the days whilst having internal, traumatising discussions with myself about potential future euthanasia.

It has been 18 months since she has been for a walk. She just didn't enjoy them any more and clearly wanted to stay home. There was no interest in her surroundings. It is 6 or more months since she wagged her tail even vaguely. Also over 6 months since she recognised anyone very familiar to her in and outside of the house. She hasn't greeted me for months also. In the old days I would be away from her for five minutes and I would get the most wonderful dance of happiness, and grin, on my return. I think she still knows who I am, I think. Toys and games that she once loved now scare her.  
 

She moans all the time. When she isn't asleep she paces round the house getting stuck in corners with me in hot pursuit. It takes a good while to settle her at night. I tuck her in, cuddle her and talk to her. Sometimes she'll mercifully drop off into a deep slumber. Sometimes she'll get up again and again and start pacing and moaning, which we both find distressing.  
 

Accidents in the house are a daily occurrence and have been for a year or more. I am planning to get rid of the carpet when she has passed! At first she seemed upset by this (she had always been such a good little dog), now she is oblivious thank goodness.  
 

Her appetite is amazingly good. She eats an awful lot, which just about sustains her weight. These days she does not always know to drink from the water bowl, oddly, and has to be encouraged otherwise she will just stand there looking and eventually move on.  
 

My vet, a month ago when we had our last check up, said she was one of the best dogs he'd seen of her age physically and her vitals were good.  
 

My partner (very, very supportive) and I used to say that 95% of the old Aggie we know and love has already gone. I fear that it is even closer to 100% now. Yet here I am, desperately wanting her to live because the thought of life without her is just too damned hard.

Coming up fast behind her is my very sweet, nearly 15 year old labrador who is blind and horribly arthritic (he's on gabapentin for this) and tragically and not least, my father with Alzheimers. These are tough, tough times with horrible decisions to be made and no happy endings. I am hoping that writing this all down may help with this in some small way.

"Elderly dog with dementia. Need advice
My rescue pup is about 16 years old, maybe more. Over the past two years he’s been increasingly getting feeble, losing coordination, getting confused, staring at walls, seems to forget to eat ( he starts, then walks away. If I put it back in front of him he eats another few bites), forgets to pee or poop when we’re outside and he’s peeing and pooping all over the house. 

He’s lost a lot of weight and his lack of coordination is making him at risk of falling down steps. When he lets me, I carry him. But, occasionally he gets confused by getting scooped up and he goes into panic mode. That also happens outside if I try to get him to poop or put when he forgets. He tries to go right back inside, but I’ll block him and sweet talk him to do his business. Sometimes he starts to trot away and doesn’t respond to my calls to come back. It’s as if he’s in flight mode. He’s tuned out the world. Even I can’t break through. He’s in “brain stem “ mode. 

I work all day. I’ve been blessed over the past couple of years to work from home or my spouse working from home when I had to go back in. Well, now she’s having to return to the office.  She has a long commute, so she’ll be out for 12 hours a day. 

I’ve started putting a diaper on him. But it won’t help with the pooping if I use the belly bands.  Plus, leaving him in a spoiled diaper all day or possibly in his poop is really bothering me. Today, she had to clean up diarrhea where he messed his diaper, himself and the floor. 

He’s my little bud. He still loves snuggles on the sofa. But there’s nothing else he really enjoys any more.

Any advice? Am I a horrible person because I’m wondering if it’s time to call it?",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/yz1aus/elderly_dog_with_dementia_need_advice/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Here goes. Not sure if this will be helpful. We had a dog with mobility issues so he fell down a lot and he had dementia as well but generally was a super happy pup. I would work on making sure he poops and pees outside prior to coming in. So a long walk because dogs tend to hang on to pee for marking. If you can and some people are not ok with it I would look into how to help your dog with this (check out handicapped pets website which has tutorials). We did this and our pup seldom had mistakes with doing this. If you cannot find the videos I can link them later. 

Now for when you’re not at home, try to confine him to a place with no carpets or rugs. If there are spots where he might go then I would get reusable potty pads and forgo the diapers. Honestly the diapers are a waste of money anyways since you have to bathe your pup. Better to clean up the floor then him each day IMHO. Oh and obviously put a dog bed in the space or blankets or something soft for him to sleep on. 

I would ask someone to come over and check on him and relieve him at least once during the day. If it’s cost prohibitive maybe try to find a teen or neighbor who can come by for a lesser charge. 

Good luck. I absolutely hate it when people say to put down a dog because he has dementia as an option so I hope people here don’t tell you to do that.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/yz1aus/elderly_dog_with_dementia_need_advice/#iwxizg5,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Thank you everyone. Watching the dementia get worse and worse is so hard. The weakness, lack of coordination, confusion and forgetting to eat is terrible to watch. Skippy is a small dog to start with (12 pounds at his max). But now, he’s down to 10 pounds and looks almost skeletal. I hand fed him as much as I can in order to keep him from “resetting” and walking away from his food. But he’s still losing weight, albeit slowly. 

He still loves affection. He’s in the sofa next to me right now. Yesterday and last night he had diarrhea out of the blue…nothing changed in his diet. So it was a tough night. 

I’m concerned about him doing as y’all have mentioned. Popping in the bathroom and smearing it everywhere during the day while we’re gone. He has moments where he paces and just roams. Other times, he just sleeps in his bed and doesn’t move all day until I get home. It’s a coin toss as to what version you get in any day. 

Occasionally, it seems like he gets a great response and forgets even who I am. So I guess that’s what the future holds. Hey become a walking brain stem. 

Thank you all for sharing the dividing line as to when you made your calls. As long as he enjoys affection, it’s a decent life. When that’s gone or it’s a daily hellscape in the bathroom when we get home, we’ll revisit the idea that it’s time.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/yz1aus/elderly_dog_with_dementia_need_advice/#iwzsbvd,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"We recently put our old girl with dementia down. For almost 4 years she would wake us up multiple times at night, sometimes pacing for hours. When she started peeing in the house we just cleaned it up. Eventually we tried diapers, and they worked ok if she peed, but if she pooped (and there was no way to know when that might happen) we would have to give her a bath and wash the cloth diaper holder (we couldn’t keep disposable diapers on her without a cloth thing that secured them.) Eventually she started pooping at night and smearing it all over herself and the floor (I’m talking about like over a 15-20 square foot area.) Mostly we didn’t leave her alone long, but one day we were gone 5 hours when I had to take my husband to the ER. When we got back she was hopelessly wrapped up in an electrical cord and the strap to a briefcase type bag and covered in poop. I had to cut her out to free her. We tried putting her in a playpen at night and she smeared poop all over that. Not long after that we gave up and put her down. It was the hardest decision we had ever made because she was still eating and still quite mobile. But we just could not keep her safe and clean. I’m sorry for what you’re going through. Dementia is really rough.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/yz1aus/elderly_dog_with_dementia_need_advice/#iwxzxdi,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"In the new year I made the decision with my 16 dog, exactly the same symptoms but also staring into space crying when she wasn’t sleeping. The vet diagnosed all the same symptoms were dementia and that when they no longer show signs they’re a dog, it’s time. She explained my dog was now more a breathing vessel than an actual dog and given all the problems she had plus crying it was best rather than hoping she would pass naturally. She also was making my then 10.5 yr old uneasy and distressed too. So I made the decision and stayed whilst it was done. I’ve never cried so much but at last she was at peace.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/yz1aus/elderly_dog_with_dementia_need_advice/#iwzof8d,,,,,,,,,,,,

"What are signs of dementia in dogs?
Anyone have experience with their dogs getting dementia and what the signs are, etc.? Our dog Bailey (F 12) is a Feist (picture a fox with no tail) I rescued when she was a year old. In the last six months her personality has drastically changed. She walks really slow, doesn’t want treats anymore, sleeps all the time, started peeing on the rug, she eats but it takes her ages. There are other small differences. Other than having glaucoma she has always been healthy. We did an initial wellness check and everything looked good. We have done blood work and urine and everything is normal. They originally thought it may be thyroid related but the results came back fine. We are waiting on scan results but the vet mentioned her personality change could be dementia? I don’t know anything for sure but want to keep an eye out for signs and of anyone has advice that has helped them it’s appreciated.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/z4f9lr/what_are_signs_of_dementia_in_dogs/,,,,,,,,,,,,

She can’t go for walks anymore, she can’t run and play. She coughs all the time. I can’t pick her up and snuggle her any more because her old bones hurt, and she only wants to sit on the special snuggle orthopedic bed I got her.

,"Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.
When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.

They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.

You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

,"I lost 2 of my pups of 12 years in the span of a month and it was extremely hard both times.  The vet screwed up with my first pup and cremated him with others so we never got his ashes back which added another burn and when we received the ashes for the 2nd pup, I had so much guilt when we burried him knowing that his buddy wont get to be with him.  I have a new pup now and things have been better but occasionally I’ll walk past old walking spots or find old bones/ tennis balls that they hid in the backyard and it’ll still tear me up.  It takes time and its ok to mourn and cry, thats the biggest thing I’ve learned from these pups.  As a guy, I’ve always been told to not cry and I’ve always suppressed my emotions even when relatives passed by staying busy or keeping my mind off it.  I thought I would be the same but I just couldnt hold it and cried for the first time since elementary school and it helped me appreciate them even more and remember the happy times as well instead of fixating on the loss.  Stay with her till the end even though its hard and others can probably agree but leaving the room and closing the door with your loved one in there is the weirdest feeling.  You’ll have doubt and guilt but just know that you’re doing whats best for her. It sounds like she had a great life in a loving home and she should be able to leave this world with comfort and without pain.

"Advice on dementia dog that I love, but is also causing a ton of stress.
Hi all, I’m really struggling right now with what to do with my Yorkie (12.5). She was diagnosed with dementia earlier this year as I had noticed a ton of changes over the past past few weeks and the vet mentioned she had dementia.

We tried a few dietary changes, medications, and at first it seemed to be working for about a month. However, it seems to be getting worse sometimes she who always was so peaceful gets snappy, has bladder problems throughout the night, and now hates her crate which I try to put her in at night now to help with her restlessness and accidents. I started walking her a few times at night to see if it’d help with her bladder, but she still is having accidents, it’s disrupting my own sleep with an already labor intense job, and I’m a woman that lives alone so I have some safety concerns with even walking her that late. I tried getting a potty grass for my patio with still no such luck.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. The cost of her meds and my other bills are stretching me already as I’ve just graduated. I can’t get proper rest because I’m antsy about her at night and she whines all night if I put her in the crate. Even my neighbor that checks on her said they can’t watch her anymore because it’s more time consuming than before (they just would walk her if I knew I’d have a long work day). I really don’t know what to do as her vet.

I hate that all the stress I’ve been feeling has made me think about putting her down. I feel shitty for even thinking about it as an option right now, but I’m so sleep, financially, and physically tired at this point that I have no idea what to do at this point.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/vfpv6a/advice_on_dementia_dog_that_i_love_but_is_also/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Elderly dog with dementia not sleeping at night
Just some background info: I adopted an 11yr old mini dachshund about two years ago, so he's now around 13. He has what I've been calling Sundowners, basically showing signs of confusion and irritation at night when he is sleepy. 

Well the past month it seems to have gotten significantly worse, still only at night though. He hasn't been sleeping well and has taken to pacing around the room in the dark and whining. This also upsets the other dogs. On the worst night, I had to pick him up and put him back in bed at least 6 times because he was lost and scared. 

What I have done so far, is I got him a baby pen with his bed and favorite blanket so he can't get lost. Set up a nightlight so he can see and hopefully not be as scared. I also have been giving him 1mg melatonin before bed to help him sleep, with permission from his vet. While all of this worked for a few days, he is back to not sleeping and now cries for hours, but if I let him out of the pen he gets confused and paces all night.

"Advice on dog dementia/senility
 Hello all  


I have a **14 year old Pekingese** who is often crying, but not for any observable reason. He has also become food obsessed and is starting to bite. I’ve had him for most of his life and neither of these is a big deal to me aside from sleeping arrangements because he goes through phases where he *won’t lay down without me laying next to him and even then often wants to get up in the night.*   


Taken him to three different vets and had X-rays and other scans and he seems in excellent physical health; his teeth aren’t optimal but so far we haven’t had any major issues. He tends to wander and cry a lot… I was worried he’s in pain from arthritis but even with medication (CBD and an NSAID) the symptoms haven’t changed. He was having seizures for a bit but the CBD seems to have solved a lot and he’s going on two months seizure free. Deafness and blindness are creeping in but I've had older and more disabled dogs and this is different.  


He sleeps with me every night and I have to let him up and down a lot; it’s inconvenient but I adore him as does my girlfriend so this is really just about him. He stopped responding to his name or any cue commands like snapping or clapping(he was never great at these anyways) over a year or two ago. He uses a pee pad in the house to go but has started doing weird things like pooping in the kitchen or dragging his refuse places. If we try and walk him with the other dog it's impossibly slow and if we let him out into the field we have he just stands there, yet sometimes he will get crazed and start darting around the apartment like he's looking for something and get very active. He has no interest in toys and never has, never really engaged in play with other dogs.  


**TL:DR I guess I'm just looking for perspective and advice on this stage from similar dog friends and what the outlook is; I've had old dogs before and the physical side always came into play first. We have some options for local play dates and maybe could try walking him more? He's in such good physical health and ability.... I don't want my guy to suffer and be sad.**

EDIT: I have another dog, half Pit/Irish wolfhound named Obi. They get along together even though Obi gets along with almost no one, because Obi grew up with him from a pup; that’s the other dog, he’s half his age and much more active. Never fixed. They’ve only played together once.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/v4lqt3/advice_on_dog_dementiasenility/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Hey! I went through this with my first dog. He had to be medicated due to the severity of his symptoms. At night, he would just pace nonstop. He constantly had accidents indoors even after just being outside. It was so freaking depressing to watch him go from the best dog ever to a helpless, confused and beyond anxious old man. He was the love of my life and my very best friend so I did anything and everything for him until the end. Unfortunately, there is no cure or training your dog out of dementia/canine cognitive dysfunction. Prescription medication from the vet will treat some symptoms but unfortunately it will only get worse. I wish you and your dog the best. If you aren’t anti prescription medication, please discuss your concerns with a vet you trust to discuss treatment options.

,"My girl just turned 13 and was diagnosed with dementia a few months ago. She has what I describe as sundowning (pacing, anxiety, trembling, confusion, only at night) but no potty issues. She now gets anti-anxiety meds at both morning and evening meals (heavier-duty meds in the evening), and I’ve switched her to a food specific for brain support, and she’s now almost back to her pre-dementia self. Took some trial and error to find the right combo of meds/food but it’s made a huge difference in her life. Talk with your vet about trying anti-anxiety meds, if you haven’t already done so - might make a huge difference in your dogs life.

She’s also slowing down a lot on walks so I bought her one of those ridiculous pet strollers. Haven’t used it yet but that’s going to happening sooner rather than later.

"Dog with Dementia, A Health Hazard
Hi everyone, this is sort of my first post here and I wish it were under better circumstances. I live with my Grandmother, who owns an old dog (16 I believe) with Dementia. She's a collie mix we think, in good health, not in pain, still eats, and still jumps up like she's a puppy when she sees the food packets come out. 

However, she's reach the point of peeing/pooping around the house frequently, which she never did beforehand. The peeing is a bigger issue. This isn't an issue on the carpet, which is an unwelcome surprise to step in, but on the tile it's exceedingly dangerous. Both me and my Grandmother have slipped and fell, and neither of us are particularly built tough. Fortunately, I've taken the harder falls and no bones have been broken yet, but I can tell it's stressing my grandmother out terribly. She's very emotionally attached to the dog (it was rescued off the street by her late husband, and is sort of her last living part of him) and the idea of having to do anything to make the dog's quality of life worse is a topic that simply can't be approached without tears.

Do any of you know of any ways to help? There are pee pads out on carpeted sections, and the tiled section is central in the home, so just barricading her from that would mean just locking her into a single room/hall.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/vwcq0m/dog_with_dementia_a_health_hazard/,,,,,,,,,,,,

You could try limiting her access using baby gates to control where she does her business but due to her age and dementia would probably cause a lot of distress. You could also use Doggy diapers. 

You could potentially give her up to owners who can better suit her needs for the rest of her life. 

It's a hard decision to finally let dogs go. My grandma wouldn't give up her terrier even though he was suffering.

"[Help] I don't know when/if it's time to let go of my senior dog with severe separation anxiety and canine cognitive dysfunction (dementia)
Heads up, this is going to be really long. TL;DR at end. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads and/or comments. Formatted on mobile. I tried to organize it in a way that makes sense. 

Picture of my dog and 19 pictures of some (not all) of the damage he’s done when left alone in the last three months [can be found here](https://imgur.com/a/ViQUkWG). Warning, there are some light bloodstains in some pictures. 

# General Background

* My dog Khan is about 10 or 11 years old, he weighs 60lbs, and he is very loved. I adopted him a little over 4.5 years ago. The shelter said he was a black mouth mountain cur, but he’s probably mixed. All I know about his past is he was shipped up from the south like many dogs are to avoid kill shelters, and a woman had him for a month before me but gave him back because he was too clingy. 

* Khan has always been clingy, but in the past three months his separation anxiety has become very severe and keeps escalating. I’ve brought him to the vet (bloodwork was fine) and consulted with a separation anxiety behaviorist, and they both think in addition to the separation anxiety he is also suffering from canine cognitive dysfunction (dog dementia). He seems physically fine, and he has a cushioned step for my bed in case he is hiding joint pain, which he uses sometimes. He is on Prozac and Valium, details can be found below. 

* For years he was totally fine being left alone even though he was clingy. He always had free range, he’s not a crate dog. The vet and behaviorist both said a crate would make him suffer even more and I agree. 

* We live in an apartment in a city right next to a huge park and a huge dog park. My room is also pretty big. He goes to the park twice a day and goes out once more at night. When I'm at work he has a dogwalker who he loves. 

* We also live with a roommate who he is very bonded to, he used to sleep with her instead of me every night (heartbreaking!) until the dementia set in and she couldn't handle him waking her up, now she shuts him out of her room at all times which I think stresses him out more. This all started after she went on vacation one week a month for about three months but didn't stop when she came back, she's been home for three months now. But she is going to be gone three weeks next month and that means he's going to freak out even more than he has been the past three months when she was home. The other night she told me I should consider putting him to sleep which shocked me. Then she suggested I give him away which also shocked me. It would be so cruel to abandon a dog with abandonment issues, and I doubt anyone else would do as much as I am to help him. I love him so much, I thought she did too. I think the apartment damage is really stressing her out but I'm going to pay to fix it. We're friends but the whole situation is becoming a source of tension. My family and co-workers also think it's time. 

* For three years we lived with my exSO who he was very bonded with, but he handled the transition when we moved about 10 months ago way better than I expected. They still see each other about once a month. He frequently travels out of state for work though so he can't really help out a lot. 

* Whoever trained him did a great job, I worry they were strict though because he isn’t very playful. He likes to chew on antlers and ostrich knuckles and plays with a frozen treat Kong but only for a little bit and only if we are home, he won't touch them if we're gone. He never destroyed anything in the past. I could leave a steak on the floor and tell him not to touch it and leave the apartment and he wouldn’t. So what I’m about to describe is very out of character. We eventually decided to get a tall thick metal gate to keep him in my room because he was so destructive to the apartment and my roommate's things.

* I work full time, but in four days (have a dogwalker as mentioned above). So three days of the week I'm home all day with him, I don't go out and don't have anyone over because that stresses him out too. Sometimes I have errands or appointments and have to leave a little bit. I used to practice leaving in short increments to desensitize him before I was told by a behaviorist that was futile because of the severity of anxiety, more details on that below. I have to practically wrestle him into my gated room before I leave, he really resists it. If I could work from home I would. 

# Symptoms

### Separation Anxiety

* I want to preface this by saying I value him way above the damage he has caused, and I do not punish him for it. In the past three months he has clawed/chewed up six door frames, six doors, a windowsill, a tall teal standing cabinet (and knocked it over and shredded the shreddable contents twice), a dresser, a vanity, a laundry basket, a chair, part of a vacuum cleaner, two thick metal bars from a gate, etc. I leave cardboard for him and he'll chew that but it doesn't prevent him from scratching up wood. I'm really worried he's going to hurt himself, so far he's split a few nails and when he ripped the bars off the gate there was blood. He also pushed my vanity into my room and the legs are unstable, so for weeks all my furniture has been clumped in a corner surrounded by barriers so he cant move it, but he still finds ways to chew and scratch it. 

* He never has accidents, but gets terrified when I take him out to pee at night and he usually refuses and drags me back to the stoop. In the daytime he doesn't pee on multiple things on our walks like he used to, just pees once. He won't eat or drink or play with his toys when we're gone. When he panics he pants and individual drops of drool fall, by the time I get home there's a huge puddle by the gate. I've filmed him before and the destruction starts as soon as I leave. Some days the Valium works better than other days and he barely destroys anything. 

* He also is not as interested in food and only eats a little bit at a time, instead of excitedly wolfing it down. He usually still likes treats though, unless he is panicking, then he refuses to eat anything. As I mentioned before he will not eat or drink alone. 

### Dementia

* The reason he also was diagnosed with dementia is sometimes he'll just stare off into space in the middle of the room and he'll try to go into a different apartment than ours after walks and he panics even when I'm home (but is only destructive when alone), and he gets worse at night. He forgets his ""sit"" command unless the Valium works better than usual, things like that. 

* At nighttime he frequently wakes me up panicking. At his worst he'll wake me up every 20 minutes, pretty much as soon as I fall back asleep. If I'm lucky and the Valium works better than usual it happens in two hour increments. He will be shaking and panting and have a crazy look in his eye, and he'll jam his nose in my eye socket and thrust his head upward, or sit on my face or chest or step on my long hair and rip it out or straddle my chest and refuse to move trapping me, etc. I used to try taking him outside but he doesn't have to pee because he just panics there too, like I described earlier. 

# Medication

* He has been on Prozac titrating up for two months, he’s been on 60mg for about two weeks. He also gets a total of 30mg of Valium a day, split into two doses for when I’m at work and nighttime. In the past we tried Xanax and Trazodone but neither helped. He also gets strong strength dog CBD everyday. 

* The Prozac/Valium/CBD is helping a little, but not that much, and it’s clear he’s going to keep getting worse. Last time I talked to my vet she said she was out of ideas for medication but I’ll reach out to her again. I was told to see a board certified vet behaviorist, essentially a vet psychiatrist, because they have more training in the nuances of brain medication, but there are very few in the country and I was quoted $900 for a consultation which unfortunately I can’t afford. I was also told by the separation anxiety specialist that we can’t work on training him unless the medication worked because when dogs are too anxious their brains can’t create memories necessary for training. 

# Other Things I've Tried

Things I've tried (open to ideas if you have them): 
* Taping cardboard over the door, thick gaffe and duct tape over the door, taping a towel over the door, putting a vacuum in the way, doing a lemon/vinegar rub (this worked but caused him to move onto furniture). 
* Various types of calming treats and a calming pheromone scent. 
* Medication described above. 
* Extra exercise and longs walks.
* Leaving a fan, lights, Bob Ross, and calming dog music playlist or long audiobook on. Leaving a frozen Kong which he won't touch anymore.
* Thundershirt. 
* My ex took him for three days so I could paint my dark navy room a light color which I thought might help with the nighttime anxiety but it hasn't. I also spackled and painted over some of the damage but his first day back he tore the door frame up again. 
* Getting ready to leave but sitting around, leaving in seconds to minutes increasing increments, not acknowledging or making a big deal about coming home or leaving.

# Other Factors

* I try really hard to be patient with him at night but the sleep deprivation is taking a toll. Unfortunately when I get woken up repeatedly I sometimes lose control of my mood and react before thinking and get frustrated with him and push him away or yell, then I feel so guilty because I know it's not his fault and getting frustrated makes it worse. Full disclosure I have bipolar disorder and anxiety, I'm well medicated and have been for years but can't take my insomnia medication anymore because him waking me up on it would make me hallucinate. 

* I'm trying to keep the effects on all of this on me out of my decision about when it's time to let go, even though it is taking a financial (vet bills, apartment repairs, various potential remedies, etc), physical, and mental toll. The decision when/if to let go will be made with his quality of life in mind first and foremost. I just don't know though. I feel bad because I know how panic attacks feel and I don't know if it's cruel to keep him alive when he experiences them so frequently and for so long. He is also terrified of thunderstorms and fireworks, and doesn't handle heat well (for example frantically digs holes to lay in and cool down during walks despite drinking lots of water) and it's getting to be that time of the year. My roommate also just dropped the bombshell that she wants to terminate the lease this September 2019 instead of 2020 like we planned, and I don't think he can handle another move. I love him so much. He's definitely suffering but has good moments sometimes, but the bad times are bad. He isn't the dog he used to be, and I know the prognosis is his brain will keep deteriorating. 

TL;DR My senior dog has severe separation anxiety and dementia and is not responding to medication. He is physically fine, I don't know when/if his mental suffering is too cruel for him to endure.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/bg810v/help_i_dont_know_whenif_its_time_to_let_go_of_my/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I had to put my 10 year old Doxie to sleep last December. His main issue was pain from IVDD, but in the last 6 months it had really changed his personality to the point that he was miserable every day. He wasn’t destructive like your dog, but the things he used to enjoy (guarding the patio door while sunbathing, walks to the park, playing with his toys, etc) didn’t appeal to him anymore. He went downhill so gradually that at first I didn’t realize it until it just smacked me in the face. We tried different meds until the vet gently told me it was the end of the road for him treatment-wise. I could have kept him hanging around for my sake, but I decided that because his quality of life was not good at all, it would be cruel to keep him here just for my selfishness. It was very difficult to make the decision to let him go, but I preferred to be in pain from grief instead of him being in pain every day and not enjoying his life.    

I think the question to ask yourself would be - is your dog enjoying life right now? If I look at the level of destruction he has caused my thoughts would be that no he’s not enjoying his life at all, especially since the medications are not reliably helping him. Obviously you know your dog better than me, the internet stranger. But sometimes we hold on more for our sake than for the animal’s sake which may not be what the animal would prefer.

,"Hi there I’m so sorry about this tough situation. I have no idea about how to help but your post is so genuine and heartbreaking and I freaking love dogs so much I don’t even have one. So let me share why that is: 
I had a JRT who was my companion for several years. He had cataracts and later appeared to be blind. I didn’t have vet money. I didn’t take him until one day I came home from work, let him out to find his back legs were collapsing. Poor baby. I held him and cried all night and took him to the vet the next day. I was horrified when they told me his corneas had separated from his eyeballs (or something horrific) and that he is probably in pain because of it. (My fault) and that his pain could be managed blah blah. But I knew it was time so we did the thing. Warning. It wasn’t easy. I could hear him yiping in the back- they were taking FOREVER to get the medication started. I marched back there, took him in my arms, balling and held him while they stuck him with the needle and administered the drugs. 
Worst things ever. A full year later I adopted a dog  who was sweet but my roommate (daughter)’s dog also my grand puppy revealed a food possessiveness which led to fights. We had to keep them separated and my dog started being destructive. But the stress of separation was too much. I walked him 3x a day and he was still crazy energetic. I couldn’t deal and neither could my daughter and her dog. So I had to return him to the rescue. I had him 3 months and cried for six. My attitude now is that unless I have bazillions of dollars I won’t take on another pet. It breaks my heart. I love them so much. 
I don’t know if this is helpful at all. I just feel for you. 
Take the basics into consideration and think about making sort of a pros and cons list but headed: things he used to do/ enjoy vs things he does/enjoys now. 
My feeling is that in your heart of hearts you already know. Sending strength and ♥️. I think it’s time but I’m not the one whose heart is shredded rn because of it. Good luck my friend.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/bg810v/help_i_dont_know_whenif_its_time_to_let_go_of_my/#eo4t6i3,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Question about dog dementia -- do the severity of symptoms come and go?
We are currently petsitting for an 11 year old lab that has been diagnosed with dementia. His owners told us about the diagnosis beforehand, warning that sometimes he gets confused, lost in the house, stares vacantly, etc. He's also got classic old dog tendencies, like stiff joints and a propensity to sleep, but overall he's still still a very happy, active boy.

We've been caring for him for 2 days now and have noticed some of symptoms mentioned above, but in general found him to be very youthful. For example, he gets very excited when it's time to go for walks and loves running for the ball.  

However, today we took him for about an hour long with walk (at which point all was normal) then left him at home alone for 4 hours. When we returned, he did not excitedly greet us as usual. Instead he slowly made his way down to the front door and then sat, staring vacaantly for about a half hour. He didn't eat his dinner (which, according to his owner, he sometimes doesn't do) and (most worringly to us) trembled quite badly from time to time. Finally after about a half hour we were able to convince him to come with us into another room and lay down, but before that he just continued to sit and stare and occasionally tremble. 

Does this happen with dog dementia? Do the symptoms sometimes come on quite strongly and then other times don't really show at all? He is undeniably an old boy, but the sudden intensity at which these dementia symptoms appeared was unnerving.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/tdft1j/question_about_dog_dementia_do_the_severity_of/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Extreme zoomies in senior dog with dementia and arthritis
I have a small mixed breed dog about 12 years old who has been diagnosed with canine cognitive dysfunction and arthritis.
He has all the symptoms of dementia and is having more and more trouble standing and walking on the hardwood floor without slipping due to arthritis.
Despite his physical difficulties, every now and then he goes into a kind of madness and starts running around the house like crazy, crashing into doors, furniture, slipping and falling, hitting the floor hard... totally out of control. It's really hard to witness because I can't do anything to calm him down (on the contrary, he gets more excited if he sees me) and I'm afraid he might actually hurt himself.
I've read a lot about mindless wandering, anxiety and confusion as symptoms of dementia but have never seen anything related to these crazy outbursts that make him race around like he's possessed.
He's done this in the past after pooping or when returning home from a walk (he gets overly excited coming back home), but rarely indoors and to such an extreme.
I'd like to know if there is anyone who has experienced such behaviors in their senior dogs or dogs with dementia?
I mean, is this related or unrelated to his cognitive disfunction?
I've read arthritis could be causing this: ""pain from a flea bite or arthritis that's acting up may spook your pup, who then runs to escape it.""",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/w01iun/extreme_zoomies_in_senior_dog_with_dementia_and/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My dog with dementia 😢
My 13 year old beagle mix rat terrier started showing extreme signs of dog dementia a little over 2 months ago. The vet put him on selegiline which worked after about 2 weeks then stopped working after 1 week. My husband and I are at our wits end. We tried taking him on long walks hemp, hemp Chews, hemp chews with thc, cbd oil for dogs. He doesn't sleep at night, cries paces soils in the house and barks, looks so scared and confused. In the day as recent as 4 days ago he's going through bad separation anxiety, knocking stuff over breaking things biting things trying to climb or hide behind things and soiling inside again looking so scared and confused. Now he's jumping up at the apartment entrance door and scratching clawing and biting till he's bloody and the door is full of blood. We don't have someone to stay with him while we are at work. We're scared he's really going to hurt himself.

"Advice needed on elderly dog that is blind, deaf and possibly with dementia
Hi,

My dog is 17.5 years old. He has gone both deaf and blind for about 1.5 years now and is suffering from symptoms of dementia. The only thing he looks forward to is his breakfast and dinner. He is uninterested in walks as he can't see and he doesn't have the strength on his hind legs. He has also stopped playing fetch and doing basic commands (which he used to love to do so much before). Although he does not seem to be suffering from physical pain, he is having more bad days than good days. He spends his day pacing around the house and knocking into stuffs. Getting stuck in places, barking and howling throughout the day and night.

I am wondering if it is time to let him go but it is definitely a very tough and painful decision to make. Would like to ask if any pet owners have any advice on this.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/vfw06h/advice_needed_on_elderly_dog_that_is_blind_deaf/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"[Breeds][Discussion] Thoughts on standard poodle as a service dog for someone with early onset dementia?
Hi /r/dogs!  I just got back from a visit to my father and stepmother, and am trying to talk my father into considering a service dog for my stepmother, who started showing signs of early onset dementia about three years ago and declined pretty rapidly until her doctors were able to get her on proper medications and other treatments.  When they were first married 10 years ago they had 2 dogs and 2 cats, but all have since died, and my dad has been mentioning since they lost the last one that he really misses having animals around the house.  However, he is really trying to do as many things on my stepmom's bucket list in terms of travel as he can while she might still be able to enjoy them and remember them, and didn't really think it was fair to bring an animal into the house if it was going to be boarded most of the time.  After seeing her this past visit and seeing how lonely and confused she could get when my dad wasn't around, I mentioned to him that he should consider a service dog, since a service dog would be able to travel with her, as well as keep her company and help with her disorientation and confusion when my dad or one of her friends isn't around, and potentially keep her from getting lost or in a dangerous situation when traveling.  She is still self-sufficient enough to not need a great deal of help and loves going on walks, but has gotten lost in the past (in a town she has spent 25 years in) and does often get depressed and lonely, so it seemed like a service dog would be great for her.  I have done some research and pointed my dad in the direction of the Dog Wish organization, as well as how to register a dog as a service dog.  It looks like that particular organization mostly works with goldens, labs and GSDs, but I was wondering what people's opinion would be about a standard poodle.  I was kind of gravitating towards a poodle because they are highly intelligent and trainable, don't shed everywhere (I know they need professional grooming but my dad could easily take care of that), my stepmother could provide adequate exercise for a poodle but then still have them chill with her at home, they are large enough to guide her around if needed but aren't huge, and are fairly tolerant of both heat and cold (they live in Colorado).  I have really liked the personalities and temperaments of all the standard poodles I have worked with (vet tech), but I was hoping people here could weigh in on whether I should suggest a standard poodle as a service dog for my stepmother or go with the more typical golden or lab.  Thanks for  any input!",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3gsbb7/breedsdiscussion_thoughts_on_standard_poodle_as_a/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Is this a common thing?  Service dogs for people with dementia?  I haven't heard of this before.

Honestly, I don't know how I feel about putting a dog (even a dog who is trained for that purpose) into a family working through having a loved one with a progressive, consuming diagnosis like dementia.  I see the pros, giving someone routine and companionship, general assistance, but unlike autism or blindness, it's going to worse.  that's just the reality.  And then your dad will be consumed with your stepmother's care in ways a dog really can't help.

,"I train service dogs for people with disabilities, but primarily guide dogs and mobility assistance dogs. I've never worked with a service dog specifically for Alzheimer's or dementia, but I can see the usefulness. In addition to what everyone else here has said, I would add that this type of service dog would need to be highly individualized. That means that enlisting an organization to help you with this and fully training a dog will take years. So I think your first step would be talking to your grandmothers doctor and seeing if the dog would still be useful 2-3 years down the line, or if her condition would have progressed by that time to a point that a service dog may no longer be practical. You can't just find a dog you like and pick it up next week. Task-trained dogs take time. 

But I can see the application! I also train dogs in scent work, so having a command where the dog leads her back home or to her car would be very valuable, as well as a ""go get help"" command. My dog is in training for search and rescue and I'm in the process of teaching him ""home"" where he finds the scent of my car and follows it back to the source, to keep me from getting lost in the woods! So the application is there, it's just the practicality of it that I'm unsure about.

,"Edit that can't get missed: Are you in the US? There is no registration for service dogs.

Standard poodles can make excellent service dogs, but you may struggle to find a program that provides poodles that also trains dogs for this situation. I would also reach out to programs working with poodles reguarly and see if they would possibly consider exploring this training style. You can potentially try and find a program to train a dog you supply, but some programs struggle to get poodles to work with their methods. 

I would think tasks may be similar to autism service dogs, like being an anchor if the person starts to wander. You can also look at having addition three way team with mom, dad, and dog in case she declines and needs support to care for the dog. I would be concerned about what may happen if she has a bad moment and potentially hurts the dog...",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3gsbb7/breedsdiscussion_thoughts_on_standard_poodle_as_a/#cu120hv,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Regardless of whether you go with a service dog or not, there are many dogs who are highly intuitive and are willing to sit and just be non-judgemental and affectionate to those with early onset alzheimers and dementia. My father in-law is in a very similar situation to your stepmother, and he really enjoys visits from therapy dogs to his day programs, and he specifically requests every time we visit that we bring our 11 month old cattle dog with us. They play together for hours, and he gets so much joy from it, even if it's refilling his water dish 5 times because he forgot he already did it or calling my dog a girl instead of a boy. My dog doesn't care, he just wags his tail and follows him around the house, or plays with him.

While boarding can be tough on some dogs, there are others who really enjoy it, but due to the evolving nature of alzheimers/dementia, I often wonder if a service dog would struggle with adapting almost on a day by day basis to the needs of the person. I'm definitely not saying they couldn't, but I'm really interested as to if there's ever an issue with the dogs interfering because they are trained for someone more advanced in terms of their deterioration, or whether they receive further training as the person's condition progresses.

I can speak from firsthand experience on the benefits of having animals around people with dementia and alzheimers, you're definitely on the right track in considering involving your stepmother with dogs in some way.

The other important thing I would consider is the stress on the spouse. Owning a dog will ultimately be your father's responsibility, and while your stepmother will increasingly be needing care, the dog will also need care. I know my mother in-law really struggles some days, it's overwhelming to watch the person you love fall apart and have to be the one to pick up the pieces every day. I know that even if a service dog benefited my father in-law, she couldn't handle it in addition to everything she has to do for him. Their cats are low maintenance, and that's been enough for them, it's also why I'm happy to provide any doggy interaction he needs by bringing my pup by for play dates.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3gsbb7/breedsdiscussion_thoughts_on_standard_poodle_as_a/#cu176e8,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. What helps and how do you know when to make “the call”?
Our sharpei has been dealing with anxiety for the last year, but within the last few months it seems to be getting worse. We adopted him in 2016 as an adult. We believe he is about 10 years old currently. 

He will be completely fine during the day. He still eats, drinks and uses the bathroom. He’ll nap during the day and be excited to go on walks. Nighttime is when he turns into a different dog. For no reason, he will pant and pace. It seems to take him forever to get settled down. 

We give him cbd, these chamomile bites and recently added in melatonin and nothing seems to really fix the issue. It’s hit or miss. Someone usually has to lay in the living room with him with the tv on until he falls asleep. Then that person slips away and goes to bed if he doesn’t wake up. If he does wake up, the panting starts all over and sometimes he will get off the couch and pace. 

We are losing sleep over this and not sure what else to do. It would be alot easier to understand if he was like this all the time but during the day he is fine. My job recently returned me to the office 3 days a week so I know he is spending the entire day sleeping. When I’m at home, we walk on my lunch break which seems to help. He does not play with toys (he is afraid of them) so walking is his only interaction. 

As I type this he is panting in the other room with my husband. He went on a walk when we got home from work. He had cbd, chamomile and melatonin almost 2 hours ago and he hasn’t fallen asleep yet.

A good death is humane, and soft. It is like slipping into a warm bath, or taking an afternoon nap. It is calm and welcoming. 
A good death is with familiar people. Not alone, not worried or confused. It is beside someone trusted who is guiding the way. 
A good death is not in fear or pain. It is not on the worst day, or the hardest one. It is as merciful as it can be to that. 
A good death is when there is recognition. When the dog is not so far gone in fear, pain, distress or cognition that they do not know who is with them or how they got there. 
These standards to me are what I uphold with all my dogs and I believe all dogs to be deserving of. The cause of death, whether age, illness, behavior, or a combination, are important of course, but their final moments on this earth are totally beyond their control, and I view it as one of the greatest things we can do for them to make them feel valued, cared for and loved in that time.

I think we spend too much of our life 'fighting' death, as though we can ever beat it. To me 'beating' death is one that happened on our own terms, and in the most beautiful and respectful of ways that we can manage. I think we 'fight' for ourselves, not our dogs - a great life with a poor end taints the greatest of lives we gave our dogs.

"[Help] Canine cognitive dysfunction
Hello everyone!

I have a 13.5 year old terrier cross. He’s gotten random anxiety attacks for a long time, but in the last year we have started to believe he has Canine cognitive dysfunction (has night and day mixed up, personality changes, anxious, panting, pacing, putting himself in weird positions/corners).

I finally got a vet to listen to me and agree that he probably has CCD and she prescribed Trazodone for him. 

He’s taken it for 3 nights now and it almost seems to make it worse? I gave it to him an hour and a half ago and now he’s been panting and panicking for half an hour. 

Does anyone have experience with CCD or Trazodone?
I will contact his vet as well! Just want to hear others experiences.

,"Trazadone is *very* old school when it comes to treating canine anxiety. It's meant more for sedation (useful for car rides, or short term anxiety), than the actual treatment of daily anxiety or cognitive dysfunction. Because it only sedates, some dogs can become panicked on it.

You may need to visit a veterinary hospital to get it, but selegiline (used in humans with parkinson's) has been approved to treat CCD. Unfortunately it only slows the progress of the disease, rather than curing it. Actual anti-anxiety medication may also be helpful, but those are typically SSRIs or gabapentin.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/jlbx49/help_canine_cognitive_dysfunction/#gaod04w,,,,,,,,,,,,

That sounds like it. I've had dogs who paced at night, dogs who thought we should all wake up and eat breakfast at 2 AM and dogs who would walk into a doorway, get stuck and not know how to move forward. 

The one who used to pace all night was on Benydrl at my vet's suggestion. It made her tired and we all slept thru the night.

,"Our Jindo mix did this.  At first we thought her wandering, getting ""lost"", and restlessness were age related dementia (she was ~11 yrs), but her symptoms gradually, and very linearly, worsened.  She went from having 1 2-hour episode every ~3-4 weeks to an episode every week, then longer episodes, until she was having more bad days than good.  It was almost exactly 6 months between her first onset and when we had to say goodbye.

This was almost a decade ago.  At first the vet suspected dementia and prescribed sedatives.  But the sedatives stopped working and our girl then started pressing her head against surfaces and having balance issues beyond the disorientation, so the vet began to suspect a brain tumor.  At that point she was about 3-4 months in, and the vet said that *if* it's the kind of tumor she thought, it has about a 6-month span from onset to the end.  It was almost exactly 6 months for our girl.

It was so hard.  In retrospect we probably let her linger too long past when her bad days outnumbered her good.  Whatever it was, like you're doing now we too thought a lot about it later.

"How do I make my dog stay with us and not sleep all day and run all night?
Back in november 2023 our (very) elder neighbors asked us is we were willing to adopt their 12/13 year old yorkie (a little girl). They weren’t able to take proper care of her anymore since she herself was also an elder. She knows me and my family because they used to travel a lot to visit their children and left her at our house weeks at a time because their children “didn’t like her” (they’re assholes btw). My mom immediately said yes because we love her so much. So she has been living here. 

But during the last few months (2-3 months) she has been sleeping ALL DAY, only waking up in the morning to eat and for my mother to walk her and that’s it. She has a very strong connection with my little sister so she spends all day in her room… Sleeping. When we wake her up and take her downstairs to be with us and try to entertain her, she gets upset and runs upstairs to be in my sister’s room. She, also, the few hours she’s awake, she spends them scratching the ground underneath my sisters bed which by the way its above the kitchen so it resonates in the whole house. 

Then, at night, she’s at full force and wanders between my room, my sisters room, and my parents. She cannot be in any bed!!! when she’s in my parents bed, she wants to get down, and goes to scratch my sisters door. When she opens it and places her in her bed, she is not comfortable so she scratches my bed and when i place her in my bed she’s also not comfortable so she wants to get down. This has been an absolute nightmare for everybody around the house. We cannot sleep… I imagine it’s not easy for her either.

We also bought her some toys and a new bed when she came to live with us because she didn’t had any. But she doesn’t sleep on her bed… She doesn’t “recognize” it as her bed.

We need a solution ASAP… we love her and seeing her being so distant with us is heartbreaking.

"[Help]What was your dog's progression through canine cognitive decline like?
 

About 10 months ago my 13 and a half\* year old husky mix was diagnosed with canine cognitive decline. Her main symptoms were pacing and panting at night. We've been giving her trazadone and gabapentin to sedate her at night. These symptoms have worsened over the intervening time. She now starts getting anxious and clingy at about 5 PM and stays that way until she gets medicated at around 9PM. The sedatives are also no long really working as she is unsettled even on high dosages.

For owners who have suffered through this, what was your dog's progression through canine like? What medicines or therapies did you use to ease their suffering? How did you decide to have your dog put down.

"[Discussion] Time to put my dog down? Am I doing the right thing?
I am sure this topic gets brought up often here, but I need reassurance so bear with me...

My dog, Louis, is a 15 year old cocker spaniel. Been a healthy dog his entire life outside of normal cocker ear issues and a TPLO surgery on each knee. In the last year I’ve noticed he’s slowed down considerably and has lost some cognitive ability as well. My vet says he for sure has dog dementia or canine cognitive dysfunction. 

I just got off the phone with the vet to make an appointment to put him down mainly because I am beginning to feel like I’m keeping him around just for me. Lately: he has not been eating as much - but he does still eat, he’s sleeping 80% of the day, has trouble getting up and walks with a hunch in his back, he is mostly deaf and mostly blind, walks in tight circles over and over sometimes losing his balance, and when he eats/drinks he cannot stand for more than 3 to 5 minutes before he has to sit and sometimes just lays down and falls asleep. He also has sometimes pooped while sleeping...or gets up at 2 am messes on the floor and paces the kitchen eventually stepping in his mess. For this reason I’ve been having to keep him mostly confined to my kitchen area. 

I realize these are all fairly normal old dog issues, but I just cannot fathom that he has any sort of quality of life. More selfishly, it’s also affecting my day to day because he gets up once between 11:30pm and 1:00 am and again at 4am on the dot. I haven’t had a full nights sleep in a long time...I know it’s selfish, but I can’t lie and say that it isn’t wearing me down. 

So, am I doing the right thing? I just need reassurance. I’ve read endlessly about the good days vs bad days thing...but his best days just means he ate more than usual and didn’t mess on the floor. He doesn’t play anymore or do anything that I think he derives joy from. I haven’t had to deal with this before so this is all new to process. 

Thanks for hearing me out.

Edit: WOW. I did not expect to get so many responses. Thank you all for the kind and reassuring words. I spoke to my vet again today and reaffirmed that it may be time for my buddy to be eased of his pain. It’s so tough with a senior dog, there were times I felt resentment toward him because of the changes he was causing to my own life. I feel awful for that and wish I didn’t think that way, especially after he’s been there for me through so much - college, marriage, and divorce. I’ll be sure I’m there for him at the end too.

My dogs are all free fed from a large bistro thing and lately we've noticed that Deputy, 11yrs old, has started to slow down on the amount of kibble he's eating.

If/when he starts dragging his back feet, I got my dog [these boots](https://www.amazon.com/Waterproof-Walking-Boots-Slip-Protectors/dp/B01NATECH0/ref=pd_day0_199_8?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01NATECH0&pd_rd_r=X3DR1V46RZRYM548S471&pd_rd_w=HAnUq&pd_rd_wg=xNI9S&psc=1&refRID=X3DR1V46RZRYM548S471)

Slightly high ankle and straps helps support the feet/lower leg, and the rubber stiff sole to help with abrasions and to help keep the foot/ankle in place and not fold under therefore helping overall balance.

I also got her this harness which was a lifesaver https://ruffwear.com/collections/harnesses/products/web-master-harness  but depending on how bad your dogs DM is, this one also has more support https://ruffwear.com/collections/harnesses/products/doubleback-harness",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/6zq56q/help_has_anyone_ever_had_a_senior_dog_with_both/#dmxbn8m,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[Help] [Discussion] Has anyone tried anti anxiety meds on a dog with Canine Cognitive Dysfunction?
Because I'm seriously considering asking my vet if mine can be put on it! 
He was rx'd with Canine Cognitive Dysfunction at the age of 6 (young I know, but he's a 74lb Anatolian/Lab/Pyr mix) and has progressively gotten worse since then (he's 10 now). He also has early DM. 

He has ""moments"" were he will whine, bark, pace and look anxious. We can find no cause for his discomfort, the other two dogs are either sleeping or chewing on something when the moments occur, and both bark at the drop of a hat, so we'd know if there was something outside he's hearing. 

He will also wake up in the middle of the night, whining and needing to be comforted. He will also sometimes pace. 

But I'm worried about how the meds will effect him due to the changes in his brain. I'm just worried about either a paradoxical reaction or aggression, even though he's a giant marshmallow of a dog, its something I worry about. 

What has your experiences been?

I am currently trying prozac. It seems to help her be more calm. Unfortunately, she is having urinary incontinence as a side effect. Overall, you can't really know how your dog will react to a drug unless you try it. It's super frustrating.

so I have a 5yr old beagle.I love her to death... She was in a hit and run when she was a year old, luckily she had a full recovery. She's suffered from separation anxiety for a very long time and we've learned to reduce her anxiety to a manageable level. I just recently moved and the dog sitter mentioned that maybe I should take my dog to a specialist BC she paces in circles and cries and whines unnecessarily. I guess I've gotten so used to it I never realized it was out of the ordinary. She mentioned she had an older dog who did something similar who had age related senility...

"It's Lexi's 13th birthday today!
Happy new year everyone!

I'm sorry if this post isn't allowed but I just wanted to share my girl's birthday. We had a really rough year in 2022, she had two surgeries in May and July and we weren't sure if she'd still be with us. 

She obviously pulled through the surgeries well, despite complications, and gave us all a scare! The vet diagnosed dementia recently, that's the term they used with us but I understand it's Canine Cognitive dysfunction. I posted for advice over on the dog advice sub Reddit and thankfully some of the tips are helping! She's doing great and sleeping at night.

Since it's her 13th birthday and everything she's been through, we are spoiling her today with different cuts of lamb(in moderation to avoid upset tummy) and making an extra fuss with her.

I love her to bits, I've had her since she was around 4-5 months old and I dread the time to say goodbye. For now though, I want to cherish every moment I have.

Happy birthday sweet girl 🥰

"Dog suddenly barking and being entitled 
Our dog is 9 years (will be 10 in march) and is a chihuahua yorkie mix. Normally every night we'll give him a treat before bed in his crate and he sleeps all night. But suddenly, with everything, he seems to be turning into a brat (in the nicest way possible). When it's time for us to take him out to pee, he'll jump into your legs and bark until he's outside. When my mom leaves in the morning, he'll bark and jump into her to get his treat that second. At night when he knows it's getting close to bed time, he'll seem to throw tantrums and bark to go into his crate with his treat. And after finishing it, he barks and won't stop. Even if someone in the room moves wrong, like turning over in bed, he'll start up barking and won't stop, even if you get onto him. It wouldn't be so bad if his bark wasn't so high and shrieky sounding. Is there a reason he's suddenly acting this way? It's been at least a few months that he's been doing this and it's getting worse. He's not seeming to show any other sighs of anything else, like being in pain or being sick. He just seems to be turning into a brat for no reason.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1hnvzz8/dog_suddenly_barking_and_being_entitled/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Stubborn senior
Lately it seems that my 10 year old dog has reverted back to a puppy. She has started peeing indoors out of choice, she has nearly unlimited outdoor time, but last week after I opened the door for her to go outside she squatted and peed AND then went out.  She's been chewing on shoes and socks (an issue that I haven't had in years). And stealing food of the counter. It's like she's a toddler again. I find myself getting frustrated with her and yelling and then feeling bad for yelling because I know it's not helpful and not good for her but I am at my witts end. I do not want a puppy I want my grown up behaved dog that I trained to not eat off my table when my back is turned and to go to the bathroom outside and not dig through the trash and chew on furniture. 
She was never ""properly"" trained (has never stayed or sat when told for long and doesnt know any tricks) but I did the best I could at 13 and I taught her how to at least meet the bare minimum requirements and its like she's just reverted back in the past few months. It's driving me crazy and I'm losing my mind all the time. I love her with all my heart but I cannot deal with new puppy attitude and keep my cool at the same time.

"Intense guilt over euthanasia
My 14 yr old English Mastiff has canine cognitive dysfunction. Doggy dementia. 

I am exhausted. I spend most of my time washing rugs and washing the floor. She will go outside to potty but instead wanders around the yard very confused. It can take her hours to do her business. My yard is securely fenced and we live out in a rural area so she is safe out in the yard, BUT it's also cold so every half hour or so, she goes out to pee. Then comes inside and immediately pees a lake as soon as I turn my back. 

She is on special old dog vitamins designed to increase cognition and remove free radicals from the brain. We do give her Proin and another pill that is supposed to help but I haven't seen any improvement. 

She nearly always pees on rugs, on blankets, on furniture or on someone's bed. All the bedroom doors are now kept shut to keep beds safe. She panics if confined to one room or a crate so crating is not an option. 

Besides the dementia, she does have mammary tumors, but is otherwise very healthy. A bit creaky in the hind end, but show me a nearly 15 yr old mastiff with no arthritis. Early stage kidney disease, but on special food for that. . 

I can't keep up with the pee. My floors are ruined. I keep washing and putting down the rugs thinking that ok, they are at least catching some of it, but they really aren't. I have family members absolutely against euthanasia and berating me for killing a healthy happy dog. I don't know what to do. How else can I handle it? She is peeing in the house probably 5-6 times a day. 

If anyone has any suggestions, I would appreciate it. I really would. I don't want to lose my girl.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sb1tbt/intense_guilt_over_euthanasia/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Regardless of what you decide, you’ve given her a great life. Part of the responsibility you take on when you bring an animal into your home is that you will not let them suffer, and euthanizing is an act of love and respect. It is a sacrifice of our human selfishness and desire to keep our pet with us for their overall well-being. You clearly love your girl and I am sure she loves you. Her brain is clearly ill even if her body is not and she has lived an exceptionally long life for a Mastiff. If the dementia is causing undue suffering, then helping her cross may be the most kind and humane choice. However, if you want to continue to manage her symptoms until you feel she is declining further, perhaps try diapers or putting tarps down (under towels if the sensation bothers her) to protect your home. Please be as patient and kind to yourself as you are to your girl. She loves you and knows you will do what is best for her. No one else’s input (other than your vet of course) matters because they are not her guardian. Anyone who would let a dog suffer needlessly has not really loved a dog.

,"I can totally relate. I have a 16 year old pug mix with CCD. His hind legs are a weak bit otherwise vet says he's totally healthy. I've asked the vet multiple times if I'm being selfish keeping him alive and she assures me I'm not.

I was losing my mind with the sundowning, pacing all night, crying like he was lost all the time, getting stuck in corners. I rarely slept for more than a few hours a night. The vet put him on a medication called Selegiline. It raises dopamine levels and has helped my dog quite a bit, he usually sleeps through the night now. It can take sometime to work though, took about a month for me to really see a difference in my dog. Might be worth asking your vet about it.

My dog also has many accidents a day indoors, with CCD they just forget their potty training. I use bellybands for my guy and use incontinence pads for women in them. Might be worth looking into diapers for your girl.

"Another Breed Recommendation Post
Introduction

**Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

*No, I have owned a Cane Corso, American Pitbull Terrier and a GSD Mix. All of my dogs were trained in basic obedience (Sit, Stay, Down, Recall, loose lead walking)*

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

*I just lost my Cane Corse to Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and my APBT to bone cancer within a year of each other. They were 10 and 9, respectively. So, I'll be going the reputable breeder route to minimize any health issues moving forward.*

**Describe your ideal dog.**

*My dream dog is medium - X- Large, minimal-moderate shedding, easily trainable, happy on a hike or in the house for a movie night. They will accompany me almost everywhere, other than work.*

**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

*My dream breed is a Dutch Shepherd, they are the most beautiful breed I've ever seen. Unfortunately, my research has built up some fear of not being able to sufficiently meet the breeds physical exercise requirements, (From my understanding, they are like Malinois level energizer bunnies that just go and go) and I've also read that they do not enjoy cuddling after a days work, which is something I absolutely need in a breed lol.*

*This has led me to lean towards the GSD breed. I do not particularly like the look of the showline GSD, but their temperament and exercise requirements seem to be exactly what I need. I LOVE the look of the dark sable working line shepherds, with the more square structure and healthier hips / elbows, but I have the same hesitations that come with the Dutch Shepherds regarding the 23.5hrs a day of exercise required to make them happy lol.*

*I also feel like the Doberman could be ideal for me, but their breed-specific health issues seem way too common. Kind of scares me, do NOT want another dog to get sick on me.*

**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

*Advanced Obedience (Strict heel, down, stay, sit, place, recall, off-lead obedience for hikes), I will be putting a TON of time and energy into the socialization of my pup so he can go to lots of places with me and be comfortable and happy, and, potentially some bite and scent work training that could translate into IPO-style dog sports for fun.*

**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

*This is a possibilty down the road when I think he's bored with our normal training routines. I have 0 experience in this field, however.*

Care Commitments

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

*I will be doing about 30-60 mins of obedience training, 60-90mins of physcial play, 2-3 walks about 2 miles each, and as much socialization I can each day. At home, my family will be interacting with him nonstop (light play indoors, cuddling, etc.)*

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

*an hour - hour and a half of physical exercise is a realistic number I can hit daily (more on weekends as I go for hikes or walk through state parks on saturday mornings), I also calculate mental and physical exercise as separate activities, so we will also be doing another 30/60 mins of mental exercise via obedience training and puzzles. This includes walks around the neghborhood, playing in our fenced backyard, going to any of the local parks, hiking, etc.*

*I will NOT be using a dog park. I have seen way too many untrained dogs at dog parks that just become a danger to have around my pups. my pit was attacked at a dog park, it took me years to make her comfortable around strange dogs again. We will walk through dog parks, but we will not be going into the kennel areas and going off leash for unstructured play with strange dogs.*

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

*I'd prefer a brushing once or twice a week, cleaning ears is fine with me, but I do not want to have to pay a groomer for constant haircuts.*

Personal Preferences

**10) What size dog are you looking for?**

*Medium to large but Extra Large is also fine with me.*

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

*My Cane Corso slobbered me out, I am now looking for as little drool as I can get while maintaining some of the traits I need. He will be my going everywhere he’s allowed to with me, so slobbering can make people uncomfortable in public or at BBQ's or something lol.*

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

*I would love to be able to keep my dog off-lead whenever it is safe to do so. I'd say very important.*

Dog Personality and Behavior

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

*I actually love both of these personalities. My APBT was a snuggle bug, while my Cane Corso would get up and go lay across the room after a few minutes of petting. If I had to choose, I'd say I prefer a snuggly dog.*

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

*Eagerness to please is a necessity for my plans with my pup.*

**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

*I would prefer for the dog to have guarding instincts, for sure. I have a son who plays in my yard and If a stranger enters my yard, they should know IMMEDIATELY  that they are not welcome. (My Corso was EXCEPTIONAL at this, while my Pit just wanted to love on everyone she saw lol). Knocking on my door -- I'd prefer an alert bark. The dog will be put into a place while I answer the door.*

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

*I hope, with the amount of socialization I'd be working on through puppyhood, that this wouldn't be an issue but, if it was, I would absolutely put the work in to fix this behaviour.*

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

*The way people talk about Huskies just bolting over fences or out of doors because they want to roam seems like an absolute nightmare. Insanely high prey drive is also something I'd like to avoid, as I live in an area that has a LOT of rabbits and small dogs walking around with their owners.*

Lifestyle

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

*The dog will be alone for 4-6hrs, 2-3 times a week.*

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

*Minimal-Moderate shedding, she will be prepping the dogs meals sometimes and playing / training with him often.*

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

*Unfortunately, no, not anymore.*

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

*Yes, I have a son (2 yrs old) and we spend a lot of time around family members ranging from 3 yrs old to 13 yrs old. I worked with my pit, who would get over excited when she saw my son and I am aware of the rough play risk a dog can pose. I am willing and able to work around this.*

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

*Never renting again.*

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

*I live in PA, USA, North America, Earth. No breed restrictions.*

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

*Peak Summer: \\\~85 F, Peak winter: \\\~30 F*

Additional Information and Questions

**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

*I have a 2yr old son, a half acre yard surrounded by 6ft fences. There are many parks around me that are dog friendly.*

*I have experience dealing with trouble behaviors (ex. my Cane Corso had crazy resource guarding and food aggression when we first got him).*

*I'm looking for a dog that can go on hikes with me, but also chill at family functions for extended periods of time. I also want to be able to train to very high levels of obedience.*

**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**

*I feel like the working line GSD would require far too much exercise than I could realistically provide, but I have no in-person experience with them.*

*Based on my information provided, does any one with working line GSD experience think I could provide the stimulation that would let them live a happy and fulfilled life?*

*Is there a breed out there (that isn't a poodle) that actually fits all of the things I'm looking for?*

Thank you for reading all of this, looking forward to hearing your recommendations!

,"Due to the misinformation regarding emotional support animals, service dogs, and therapy dogs, we have provided a brief summary of the role and rights afforded to each type of animal in the United States.

**Emotional Support Animals (ESAs)**

ESAs are animals prescribed by a medical professional to support a patient with a disability. They are only recognized in the United States.

* ESAs are only granted rights through the [Fair Housing Act](https://www.justice.gov/crt/fair-housing-act-2). ESAs are no longer allowed in-cabin on planes. ESAs are **NOT** granted access to public buildings, restaurants, stores, etc. 

* ESAs are prescribed by a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, or doctor as part of an ongoing plan to treat or manage a federally recognized disability. Online registration options for ESAs are scams and not legally recognized.

* An ESA must be requested as part of a reasonable accommodation for a disability with a letter from the prescribing medical professional demonstrating the need for the accommodation to be granted housing rights. These housing rights do not exist in the case of the [The “Mrs. Murphy” Exception](https://fairhousing.foxrothschild.com/2010/06/articles/fha-basics/the-mrs-murphy-exemption-to-the-fair-housing-act/). Landlords cannot legally require you to pay a 'pet deposit' or charge 'pet rent' for your ESA because they are not considered pets. However, they can require that you pay for repairs if your ESA causes damage to the property.

* ESAs can be any animal it is legal to own, for example: dogs, cats, guinea pigs and miniature horses. They are most commonly dogs.

* **Calling your pet an ESA to get around no-pet accommodation, breed bans, or airline restrictions is immoral and illegal. It makes it much harder for legitimate ESA teams to be taken seriously.**

**Service Dogs (SDs)**

SDs are a worldwide, legally protected medical aid which provide a range of tasks or work to help disabled people. The following discusses information specific to the US. Please check your country’s laws if you live outside of the US.

* SDs are not used solely by the blind. SDs can assist those with a wide range of disabilities including physical (eg. fibromyalgia), sensory (eg. deafness), psychiatric (eg. PTSD), developmental (eg. autism) and neurological (eg. brain injury). 

* SDs can be trained by programs or by their owners (owner-trained).

* SDs must perform at least one task to mitigate their owner's disability/ies. Things which do not count as work or tasks include: emotional support, being calmed by the animal's presence, or giving 'kisses' on command. Some examples of tasks can be found [here](http://www.iaadp.org/tasks.html).

* SDs can legally enter almost any no-pet place. Exceptions include sterile environments, places where it would be dangerous to the SD or others for them to be there (such as some exhibits in zoos), and food preparation areas.

* Any SD can be legally asked to leave an establishment if their behavior is disruptive. For example, if they bark at customers, damage goods, or eliminate on the floor.

* There are no nationwide or statewide registries for SDs. None. Some SDs are provided by programs, but the programs themselves are not official registries as SDs come from a variety of places. SDs are also not required to wear a vest or harness.

* The only questions legally allowed to be asked of a service dog handler when entering an establishment are: 1) ""Is that animal required because of a disability?"" 2) ""What work or task has the animal been trained to perform?"" If the handler does not answer these questions appropriately, the animal may be restricted from entering or asked to leave.

* In order to rent/own a dwelling that has a 'no-pets' clause with an SD, a reasonable accommodation must be requested from the landlord. If your disability and/or your disability-related need for the SD is not evident, information must be provided to the landlord detailing this (for example, a letter from a medical professional). Landlords cannot legally require you to pay a 'pet deposit' or charge 'pet rent' for your SD because they are not considered pets. However, they can require that you pay for repairs if your SD causes damage to the property.

* Many states do not protect the rights of service dogs in training.

* Service animals also do not have to be dogs. Federally, miniature horses are also granted rights as a service animal. Some state laws grant rights to even more animals.

* In 19 states (and counting) it is illegal to present your pet as a service dog when it is just a pet or an ESA. Faking a SD to get around no-pet housing, take your pet to the store, or bring your pet to college makes it much harder for legitimate SD teams to live their lives and poses a serious danger to the public.

**Therapy animals**

Therapy animals are animals (primarily dogs) trained by their owner to provide therapeutic support to others. They go to places such as schools, nursing homes, and hospitals to relieve stress, build people’s confidence, and promote emotional health. They do not provide support or assistance to their owner.

---

If you require emotional support through the presence of an animal, you should look into ESAs. If you require ways to alleviate your disability, you should look into service dogs. If you wish to volunteer with your dog to help others, you should look into therapy dogs.

,"I don’t think you’ll find much breed overlap between dogs that do well with public access and dogs that are protective by nature. those are just… incompatible drives. That being said, there’s a reason labs are so popular, super trainable easygoing adaptable dogs. A black lab will look more “intimidating”. 

I don’t want to get into a debate about emotional support dogs, but it’s wildly unethical to take them EVERYWHERE with you. Only service dogs get that kind of access and only shitty people say that their dog is a service dog when it’s not. If you want a dog that can go everywhere that dogs are allowed to be, a lab is still a great choice.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/#k0l73gz,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"There’s a few contradictory needs here… an ESA CANNOT go everywhere with you, period. That is a service dog, specifically trained to perform tasks that mitigate your disability. There is no registry for either an ESA nor a SD. Since you own your own home, there’s no need/benefit to label it as an ESA. Please thoroughly read [the rights and responsibilities](https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-faqs/) for service dogs if that is the path you want to take.

You’ll also struggle to find a breed or even a specific dog that has both guarding instincts, and the temperament to work as an SD in public. I would take a step back and consider your absolute priorities for this dog, to either be a SD or the more chill family pet you’ve described.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/#k0lig95,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"An hour a day of exercise rules out a lot of larger breeds. IPO is *very* time consuming and there’s not much overlap between dogs/breeds that excel in that kind of sport and and also wouldn’t make your life miserable with only an hour of exercise per day. That being said, any breed can do nosework and obedience. 

Consider a Great Dane, olde English bulldogge (not same as English bulldog), mastiff, French mastiff (drooly), setter (may be too mellow for guarding). Maybe a Rottweiler if you can find one from pet or show lines with lower energy parents. And of course labs are always a good option.

I have a working line European Doberman and would say an hour of exercise plus 30 minutes of obedience is not enough for most Dobermans unless you end up with a one-in-a-million couch potato anomaly or adopt a senior. I’m also quite familiar with working line GSDs and would not recommend one for your lifestyle; I give my dogs 4h of physical and mental stimulation a day everyday and even I would steer clear of those, lol.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/#k0l6wnt,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You might consider a standard or giant schnauzer.  They can keep pace with any reasonably active person but do have an off switch.

,"Actually, I think a Rottweiler could be a good fit. I think you could find a stable show-line one that would be friendly-enough but meet your guarding desires. Alternatively, a boxer or Doberman could be good though they do have health concerns. And a boxer may be too slobbery or goofy for you. You may also be interested in a Beauceron or a Bouvier, though they’ll be harder to find. If you’re looking for a more gentle dog, perhaps a Greater Swiss Mountain dog which is similar to a Bernese mountain dog but with a shorter coat and fewer health concerns.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/#k0mv0mn,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Well, if you're after minimal shedding, that basically rules out most shepherds for you.

FWIW, I have a White Swiss Shepherd (Berger Blanc Suiss). They're a cousin to the GSD, but bred with straight backs and mellower temperaments (they're not suitable for police work or Shutzhund, but make wonderful therapy dogs and enjoy tasks). My boy is 4 1/2, and is an absolute doll - but we call him The Furnado for a good reason :)

"Feeding your dogs once a day, thoughts?
 A new study that assessed over 10,000 dogs offers some startling insights into the apparent links between feeding frequency and canine health – and the key takeaway is definitely food for thought.
According to the research, adult dogs that are fed only once per day tend to score significantly better across several indicators of health, compared with dogs that are fed more often.
""Controlling for sex, age, breed, and other potential confounders, we found that dogs fed once daily rather than more frequently had lower mean scores on a cognitive dysfunction scale, and lower odds of having gastrointestinal, dental, orthopedic, kidney/urinary, and liver/pancreas disorders,"" the research team, led by first author and canine health researcher Emily Bray from the University of Arizona, explains in the new paper.
The results are gleaned from data collected by a broad, ongoing canine health study called the Dog Aging Project.

"Wasn't prepared for the pain of losing my first dog...
I grew up in a dog household and lost my first two in rather tragic, abrupt circumstances. It was terrible, obviously, but my lasting memories of those dogs were always of them healthy and happy. 

I got my own dog when I turned 20, and now at age 33, we have an appointment for him to cross the rainbow bridge tomorrow afternoon. 

He has been the absolute best dog and I love him more than I could begin to put into words. He has watched me flunk out of college, hit rock bottom, start over and eventually earn my Master's, start a career, get divorced, find myself/a sense of self worth, fall in love again, get married again, move cross country, along with all the bits and bobbles in between. I don't remember what life is like without him waiting for me at the door, or without him pressed up against me as I sleep. 

It's obvious it's his time to go. He has canine cognitive dysfunction and has declined somewhat significantly in the past few weeks. As I looked at older pictures of him yesterday, I realized how much I've already been missing him throughout the past year and a half. Watching him age has been an honor, but a heartbreaking one at that. 

I think, like most of us here, I just need to post to serve as an outlet to my pain, and this whole process is agonizing. I think I'll feel better when his time comes, it's so hard watching him as he is. I miss my healthy boy so much it physically hurts. I'm sad to have the memories of him getting sicker in my brain, but am proud of what I've done to care for him and give him the best possible life despite the less than ideal circumstances. It's just crazy to me that watching him life a long, good life and then die at a somewhat acceptable time has been so much harder than my previous, abrupt experiences with pet death. 

In the meantime, I've rented a sniff spot that we're going to hang out in leash free in a bit, then I plan on grabbing a hamburger for him to graze on as we sit and watch dogs walk by from our stoop. I was able to train him fairly well, but barking as passers by was something I could never quite break. Typical terrier. I hope I hear him bark today. Nothing would make me happier. 

No real point of this post. I just really, really love my dog. I'm really, really going to miss him. My best boy. My best friend. My heart is shattered.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/wlug3p/wasnt_prepared_for_the_pain_of_losing_my_first_dog/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Dog with kidney disease-need advice.
The vet is closed until Monday.

My dog (12 year old chihuahua) was diagnosed with kidney disease today and from what I can gather, she is stage 3. I took her to vet because she has not been sleeping at night - it’s like she had extreme anxiety but no pain. She will eat, drink, and her behavior is for the most part normal, but she paces and won’t settle down. Normally when she is feeling discomfort she won’t touch food. 
I was given a pain med, she had some fluids, something for nausea, and an antibiotic. I was also told to give her 1/4 Pepcid with food (chicken and rice).
She ate about 30 minutes ago and just started another “episode” of this. For the last 2 nights, she wants me to hold her while standing. If I sit down, her anxiety comes right back and she jumps out of my arms to pace again. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. It seems to only happen at night which means I’m not getting any sleep. She is currently sitting in my lap calmly. We are outside and it’s getting chilly but I’m scared to move in case it upsets her. 
Has anyone else gone through this? What helped? I’m scared the end might be coming sooner than expected. 

Any advice would be appreciated.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/11v6wcl/dog_with_kidney_diseaseneed_advice/,,,,,,,,,,,,

He showed symptoms again but it sucks, it's holy week/holiday in our country and we haven't found a vet hospital that would confine him today. We're thinking of putting him down as well if it won't get better. 😭

Background: my dearly beloved 11yo Malamute has arthritis and canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (dog dementia.) We are working with the vet to figure out a combination of meds that will manage his symptoms. Unfortunately, both pain and the dementia seem to make him anxious, and neither disease is linear. I'm trying to keep a log of Charger's symptoms so I can adjust his meds better, which I have been doing in a spreadsheet... but that's getting unwieldy and is hard to use on my phone.

Question: does anyone have a health symptoms tracking app they like, which might work for a dog? I'd love it if the app had some customization of what data it collects, and reminded me to log data twice per day. Being able to export data would also be great.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/12cp64y/symptom_tracking_app/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Please make sure you are supporting breeders who care about the long-term health of their dogs.
I am so heartbroken and also just angry My coworker had an amazing dog. He was a doodle, not sure what kind, they aren't for me, BUT he was so sweet and even tempered, best doodle I ever met, and I have met alot of them. 

He had to be put down this weekend because of a genetic condition that the vet told them, if the parents had been tested this could have been an avoided tragedy.  
She is now looking into a dog from the same breeder that's now doing a different kind of doodle.   
I overheard them say ""I know it was genetic, but he was such a good dog, I trust their judgement to not test and go for temperament"" I had to remove myself from the room. 

When you are looking for a dog and want to buy, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure they at least do some health/genetic testing to be sure your pup has a good chance to not end up with a preventable issue that may cut their life too short. It's worth the money to save you potential heart break.

I know so many people who bought dogs from mills (that don't care) and back yard breeders (who just don't know better) who didn't test and lost their dogs so so so young. I am really passionate about this because is so many cases it could have been avoided with education. Be it Doodle, Poodle, Dalmation, Spaniel, Beardie, Chihuahua to Irish Wolf Hound make sure you are supporting someone who cares about their pups long past when they leave the whelping pen. It is our duty to make sure any living thing we bring into this world will not have to suffer because of something that could have been avoided. \*\*I know testing isn't going to catch everything but atleast it's a start\*\*",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/s1vmy3/please_make_sure_you_are_supporting_breeders_who/,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a huge issue with people who buy backyard breeder/mill dogs and say ""i know it's not perfect but i'm ok with it"", because of the reason above, but also, the mothers are rarely well taken care of.

,"I have a lab, adopted from his first owner at 6 months old, who gave him up after having him only a few months. He came from a farm, almost certainly a BYB, and we just found out that he has moderate hip dysplasia (and he just turned 1). Vet said it's 100% genetic in his case. It also seems he might be anaphylactic to tick bites, after a very scary incident where he was extremely ill and could have died. Not to mention he has stranger reactivity issues from not having been socialized as a puppy (COVID dog). Needless to say, we have already spent a small fortune on trainers/vets/behavioralists, might need to go through allergy testing in the near future, and possibly some very expensive surgeries down the road.

The entire family is head over heals in love with him. He is an extremely affectionate dog with everyone he knows. He is a dream in the house. Super calm but playful and goofy. Always up for fun, but knows when to settle. Doesn't cause chaos or trouble. Always cuddling and asking for pets. Very smart and far along on obedience training. Everyone who knows him absolutely adores him. If this dog goes early due to an insect bite or joint injuries, there will be a HUGE amount of heartbreak.

Luckily, if he needs hip replacement surgery, we're in a very privileged position where we can afford the $10-20K it will cost, and will pay it happily if it improves his quality of life and his longevity. He could easily have ended up with a family where this would have been a hardship or an impossibility.

At the same time, f\*\*\* these breeders who do this to poor, innocent animals. He's just a very good boy who doesn't deserve to not be able to jump and run like he wants to, so that he can still walk in a few years from now.

"Moved my dog from Houston, TX to Washington, and am pleasantly surprised at how big the move has been on his mental health.
He absolutely loves snow. He got to experience it for the first time, and he’s in love. It just gets him into full-zoomies mode, and he’s so excited to explore and stick his nose into everything. He likes to eat snow, and he likes to get pelleted by snowballs. He likes when I hide treats or his ball in snow, so he has to dig to find it. He even likes hail! 

The biggest difference I’ve noticed was that he was constantly panting in Houston. Even in the winter time. I never catching him panting anymore in the house, and it was 24/7 before. He’s a GSD.

They do have that double coat, but I never realized how much happier he would be living in a cold area. Anyone else experience this?

"Can a well bred dog still have numerous health and behavioral issues? 
I have a 3 year old working line black Labrador retriever who I have gotten from a (what I believe to be) a good breeder. This is my first dog and I am not fully versed in breeding and how genetics in dogs actually really work. 

Before I got him I did my research, talked to the breeder numerous times and met his mother and the other dogs in her home. Everything seemed really great. The parents are both health tested and have great scores, have great titles from championship as they are working line labradors. His dad was flown in from Ireland to breed. Online I could find a generational heritage line going back 5 generations. No information about health testing for the older ones but I could probably find out if I really wanted to. The only “issue” I could find was that the dad  has a 3/7 hip dysphasia score. I don’t even really know what that means. I met the puppies 3 times and everything seemed great as a first time dog owner.  My puppy was the most aloof and very independent at 9 weeks old. The breeder picked him for me saying “you’re young, you can handle a challenge” i still wonder if I should have just said no to that. 

My dog has so many issues. I love him more than anything and we have worked hard on his issues. Now we are finally after 3 years getting to a good place with his training and his temperament. He has chronic gastritis which my vet believes resulted in high anxiety as we couldn’t figure out at first why he has so many stomach issues. He’s now on a hyperallergenic diet and doing well but during the crucial months when he was younger I didn’t know what was wrong with him even after many vet appointments. This led to him being very reactive to strangers interacting with him. Which shouldn’t be the case in a well bred Labrador. He would lunge and growl at strangers who looked at him a bit too long or tried to speak to me (not even him). This period of time was hard and isolating for me. I spent thousands on trainers and dog schools but it didn’t change much. This started at 12 weeks old and got worse as he got older. After no progress with trainers. I started to simply challenge him with new situation and heavily rewarding good behavior. Slowly he got more confident and I can now take him with me to restaurants and meet new people with almost no issues. But it took a long time and was emotionally really hard for me as he is also a big dog and I’m a small ish woman; so his reactions were scary for everyone involved. I still have a lot of management i need to do in certain situation for him to succeed. 

Around 1 1/2 - 2 years old his behavior  outside got worse. Constant pulling, obsessive sniffing to the point where he would take me down If I tried to walk him away from a spot he wanted to sniff badly. I have been injured by him pulling me down the stairs or just the constant pulling hurting my Shoulders, knees etc. 
Took him to many trainers, they all said it was teenage behavior which I knew wasnt true. Only 1 trainer said that he has never seen behavior like his in a lab and doesn’t really know how to fix it. He’s a smart dog and likes to learn but after more than 10.000€ spent dog trainers and vet appointments he still can’t walk on a loose leash?? I knew something was wrong with him. 

After being dismissed by so many trainers and vets about his “teenage boy behavior” I just decided to neuter him and hope for a change. So I found a better vet who listened and found out he is hypersexual and had a massively large prostate. Now he’s been neutered and he’s so much more calm, less nervous and less reactive. Great recall, great off leash. It’s like all our hard work finally clicked in his brain. 
I also found out he has mild hip dysplasia. Nothing serious for now but not great for when he gets older. 

I love my dog. He is my whole world. But he’s a mess. Most people would have given up on him and after a particularly bad day I thought about it too. This working dog could never  be used for hunting, I could barely walk him for a long time. So my question is: considering all of his issues, how can he be from a good breeder? Am I morally obligated to tell my breeder Incase she breeds his parents again? 
Did I just get unlucky or does it have to be genetic? He’s deeply loved and exceptionally well taken care off and never encountered anything actually scary that could explain his behavior.

,"I think a responsible breeder would absolutely want to know about the hip dysplasia and behavioral issues, so they could try to get that out of their lines. Not sure what the 3/7 means but if it’s a lower than “good” score the dad shouldn’t have been bred. I do think the breeder did an objectively bad job choosing a puppy for you. This is your first dog.

To be honest I’m not sure this was the right dog for you. A working line dog will be more work, which could be difficult for a first time owner, and if he’s actually bred for working, rather than just from a working line - and from a good breeder I’d guess they likely are? - then he’s probably going to need quite a bit of work. Dogs bred to work are not necessarily the right temperament for pets.

Your breeder should have discussed this with you, and worked out with you if a working dog was the right fit.

,"So first of all yes even a dog from a good breeder can end up having behavior or health issues.  You are greatly stacking the deck in your favor but genetics are complex and there are no guarantees so it does happen.  

Are you in the US?  I have not seen a 3/7 hip rating before and that kind of waved a yellow flag to me, when you say your dog has mild HD how was that diagnosed?  You might try searching or posting in a fb group like Uncensored Opinions of Purebred Breeders (For Real) and getting some more opinions of the quality of your breeder.  They allow anonymous posts as well if you want to get advice without putting your name out there.

I'm going to be honest behavior wise he sounds like a typical working line dog with an inexperienced owner who is going to pet trainers not used to high drive dogs and wants positive only training.  You were willing to put the work in to get him where he is today but it was a much harder road than it needed to be.  If you can look in your area for training clubs and local dog sports communities.

,"I read through your response and I'm not going to address the specific case here or parse whether or not this breeder is good or bad, but as a breeder, I will say that yes, unfortunately sometimes dogs do come out with health/temperament/structure problems even with the best of breeders. Conscientious, ethical breeders try their very best to stack the genetic deck in the puppies' favor. They try their best to not produce problems by studying pedigrees, doing smart outcrosses, and health testing to the extent that the breed asks them to; however, there are a lot of problems that are a) polygenetic and/or b) unmapped making it impossible for the breeder to be completely accurate with their choices. When (not if) problems occur with a puppy, the breeder should be supportive-  both in advice to the extent that they have knowledge on the issue, and a willingness to refund (some cases) the purchase price of the dog, and a willingness to take back the dog at any point for any problem. I've bought and bred dogs who ended up with problems; unfortunately, it's just a thing that happens with living creatures.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1e6bsvb/can_a_well_bred_dog_still_have_numerous_health/#ldryxgt,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It feels like there’s a combination of  factors going on. First, the breeder knowingly gave you a more challenging dog from the litter. An aloof and independent dog is going to be more tough to work with, especially if it’s your first dog. So, that’s not great. Have you been in contact with them? A reputable breeder should be willing to offer advice and ultimately take the dog back if they’re not a good fit. If they’re unwilling to provide support, that’s not a good sign.

I’ll be curious to hear what others say but it sounds like you got a somewhat typical intense, working line dog. They are super challenging, especially through puppyhood and adolescence. They’re more independent, driven, willful, and require more careful socialization. They need a job and can easily become reactive.

What training methods had you been using? It sounds like positive reinforcement is working really well for you, so good idea to stick to that. And it sounds like all the hard work you’ve been putting in is paying off and he’s mellowing out nicely as he enters adulthood. You’re doing a really great job. I have a drivey dog and at 2.5 years all our work is finally starting to pay off. Labs mature slowly so I’m not surprised you’re just now seeing the results of your training.

Ultimately genetics and the environment mix together to create the dog you have. Plus all the health issues are genetic. There are certainly genetic factors going on here.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1e6bsvb/can_a_well_bred_dog_still_have_numerous_health/#ldrw9iy,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It’s a bit of a difficult question. Yes health testing can weed out a lot of health problems but some we can’t test for. In general breeding usually wouldn’t use dogs with issues in The breeding program but with some issues you don’t know until symptoms are present. If that happens later in life, the dog might have already produced puppies which could have problems even if the sire had a clean bill of health at the time.

Temperament is also such a thing. There are many international and external factors and no, no breeder ever can completely predict how a dog turns out in the end. Law of inheritance is only one of many factors that will have impact.

So, yes in general: a great breeder still can “ produce” a problem dog. 

The question in your case would be: how was the breeder’s reaction to your problems. Was he there with help and advice? Was he interested and tried to help? That’s where the difference lies. 

Ps: hip score 3/7 means that one side scored a 3 and the other a 7 together it gives a 10 the median score for a lab is 11 so yes it was a fine score.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1e6bsvb/can_a_well_bred_dog_still_have_numerous_health/#ldrwmki,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Buying from a reputable breeder stacks things in your favor. But dogs are living beings, there is no way to ever guarantee their health will be perfect. There's environmental factors that affect health, the same health that should be tested for like hips too. Its not a perfect science. There's lemons even with a breeder's best efforts. 

I personally have found that some field line labs are super difficult dogs. Unless you're a hardcore working home, they dont do well. The're very different than a bench/show type lab, a 180 in how well they do in your average active family home. Breeders value different things in their breeding goals and if their focus is strictly on working ability, they can be reputable but not a good match for you. 

Yes you absolutely should be discussing your struggles with the breeder. They need to know about health and temperament issues. They should also be a source of support for you and should be in the best place to help you as they'll know their lines the best. 

I have a dog from someone who's definitely a reputable breeder, without any question. But 3 puppies in his litter died from epilepsy at age 2. My dog fortunately was not one of them, but he has a rare (unlikely to be genetic but might be) disease. Things happen. When these things happen, how the breeder reacts and how they change their breeding program is what may define them as being reputable. My dog's breeder completely cut off breeding anything related to those dogs.

"[Vent] Dogs & Mental Health - We can't fix everything.
I hate not being able to fix everything. I've been working at my clinic for about 7 months now. A week and a half ago, an owner surrendered a 1.5yo intact male Boerboel. They had raised him from 8 weeks and surrendered him because he had begun to growl at the kids. When your dog is a 140lb Mastiff, you dont take that lightly. The dog was a prime example of his breed, loyal and strong, and just a bit goofy. I fell in love with him immediately. I know that attachment is not the best in my line of work, but it was love at first sight. 

Over the last week, I found that he was a smart boy - caught on to the routine in one day, listened when I told him not to mess with the gate, even head great leash manners. His previous owners had clearly put a lot of effort into his training. At the same time, we discovered that he wasn't growling because he didn't like kids. He chased shadows that werent really there. He spooked at leaves falling and at birds flying away. He was suspicious of anyone that wasnt me. There was clearly someyhing neurological going on, and it was getting worse.

Anyway, we put him to sleep yesterday. I was basically the only person he trusted, so I gave him the sedatives and stayed until they kicked in. I held his massive head as he went. It was peaceful - minimal stress and lots of yummy wet food. I cried a lot last night. He would have been my ideal dog. I loved him, but we couldn't fix him.

"Be wary and CHECK all claims of breeders who test their dogs for health issues: I've noticed a lot of shenanigans and fraud around. Also, the AKC Breeder of Merit designation has issues, too. Remember, AKC/CKC =/= responsible breeding. Example included. [Discussion]
I'm helping a friend look for a reputable breeder. I'm seeing lots of bullshit claims: 

- health checks: means nothing. Could be a prelim check by a vet. 

- health tests: Sometimes they only test *some* of their breeding stock; sometimes they only do 1/3 of the tests recommended. 

- fake OFA numbers: Tempted to name and shame but I'll wait since there can be a delay between the exam and uploading the results to OFA online. It should be a week. 

- Breeder of Merit: Let's look at [Jetstar Chihuahuas](http://www.jetstarchihuahuasandschipperkes.com/). What's that? A big fucko BREEDER OF MERIT icon on their website. 

Well, what is a [Breeder of Merit](https://www.akc.org/breeder-programs/akc-breeder-of-merit-program/)? Among other things, a breeder of merit needs to ""Certify that applicable health screens are performed on your breeding stock as recommended by the Parent Club.""

Well, what does the Chihuahua Club of America say? [They say chihuahuas need cardiac, eye, and patella testing.](http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.org/health-committee-mission/chic-health-testing/). 

 
Let's see what [Jetstar Chihuahuas are selling in the AKC Marketplace.](https://marketplace.akc.org/breeder/jetstarchihuahuascom/chihuahua/166859) 

Oh, more claims that they do the testing required by the parent club. [Let's look up the dam's registration number. What does it say? She's just getting tested for her knees.](https://www.ofa.org/advanced-search?quicksearch=TS19015002) The sire doesn't show up; it could be delayed but who knows, goddamnit. 


Found lots like this today. Fake OFAs, claims to do health testing but fails to test either none or only one of the parents of the litter you're interested in, using the term ""certified health checks."" Sneaky. [Or inept--I know it's not all malicious.]

I'm glad that this system is in place because it's better than nothing. But I don't want people who are trying to support responsible breeders get shafted.

It took my husband and i 2 years to find a reputable Boston Terrier breeder in our area (we had also filled out applications at all of the nearby rescues and shelters just in case one came in). We finally found someone who was willing to show us certificates, parents health records (verified by calling the veterinarian who performed the tests, and we continued with the same vet) and allowed us to actually come into their home and meet our puppies mother. The home check was what won me over when we saw the absolute princess treatment our pups mother was getting, as well as the fact that she was well socialized, non aggressive, and lacked any deformities that might indicate that she was being overbred. The breeder even refunded us  $500 of our deposit (without us asking) because after the puppy health check, they found that our Lola might be prone to cherry eye (she was the runt and her eyes are real buggy, but we never planned on breeding her so we didn’t mind). I’m glad we waited such a long time to choose someone who didn’t overbreed their dog (one litter every 2-3 years) and who we could periodically see at the vet.

The house was in a nice neighborhood, there were 7 adult dogs on the premises and there were no matted or unkempt coats, no long toenails, no nasty teeth, no neurotic behavior displays.  I saw the mother, the grandmother and the great grandmother.  She also had a littler of 9 puppies there.   The house was clean and did not smell.  The puppies were in an expen where she had a jungle gym set up.  All of the dogs  puppies and people into went out into the back yard which was not a minefield of excrement.  I played ball with her current performance dog, picked up, coddled the puppies and observed all of her dogs closely as we chatted about the breed, nutrition and vaccination protocols. I filled out an application and left a deposit on the spot and asked when the puppies would be ready.
 This woman had puppy handling parties, took them on a road trip, had her young grandchildren come over to cuddle them.  She has birthday parties for her dogs where the dogs  sit on chairs and while wearing hats, wait their turn as she cuts the homemade dog cake...of course then it gets a bit chaotic....lol.  Nope this gal is the real deal....half of the litter was gone before they hit the ground.  Since the litter was larger than expected, I got one.  It was not inexpensive but it was a good decision.

"Want to adopt from a shelter, but worried about dog’s health
Hi All. I went to the shelter today and fell in love with one of the dogs there. I’m tempted to adopt, but I’m terrified of what I can encounter once I bring home the dog and take her to my local vet. 

I hope you don’t mind the brevity of my confusion. But for some context: I’ve never adopted from the shelter but just rescue groups that’s I have found very thorough and reputable. Eg: my adopted dogs were all previously screened with a clean bill of health before adopting. I’ve also adopted dogs with health issues that has absolutely broken my heart, which is where my worries are stemming from.

When it comes to shelter dogs, how does that work? Do you adopt with the health risks the dog may have? (Eg. What if I take her to my vet and find out she has underlying conditions?)

Usually shelters vet check the animals, obviously you can't control whether the dog gets sick after you've adopted But you can do regular vet checks to quickly catch anything that needs to be caught.


As someone who just brought home a senior dog who lived in really and conditions and wasn't given vaccines or any sort of health stuff apart from flea meds, I understand the fear. But knowing she lives somewhere we're she can get her needs met, where she can't live the rest of her life out, how ever many month or hopefully years that is makes it all better. 


She now knows what it feels like to live inside a house for the first time in 9 yrs and seeing how much she loves it is so heartwarming, she now looks at me like where crazy whenever I try taking her out to the toilet at night. The first time I put a harness on her she struggled so much, she hated it but the after she went on her first walk in it, she now loves it, if she sees her harness or leash she goes crazy. It never fails to make me happy. 


Even if its only for a short time, even if there is a risk, I think giving a dog like my dog, one may have never had these opportunities, one who may have never felt loved a home is so much more rewarding and it makes any and all risks so worth it.  


Obviously do the right choice for you. Whatever that may be. I wish you the best of luck and if you go the breeder route, please do not buy from a breeder who doesn't take back dogs. A breeder who makes it a rule that you need to return the dog to them in cases where you can no longer keep the dog instead of giving the dog to a shelter or rehoming is the only type of breeder that should be supported ever, the other are contributing to the problem!",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1hx6xvd/want_to_adopt_from_a_shelter_but_worried_about/#m67a68o,,,,,,,,,,,,
,So the shelter puppy hasn’t been to the vet since they arrived at the shelter ? Can you not ask about that? Where I am from the dogs have been checked for possible illness since the shelter obviously also needs to know if they require some medicine/treatment. You can ask the shelter I guess and if this is such a big deal breaker you maybe can offer to pay for a vet check up and decide after you get the results? But in the end: would you really not adopt the guy when he is in fact sick ?

"My take on ""if you can't afford the vet, you can't afford the pet""
""If you can't afford the vet, you can't afford the pet"" is something that I hear very often in the dog community.

I agree with this, but only to a certain point. Here's why:

Before I brought home my first puppy last year (I was 16) I made absolute sure that I had the money to buy:

. All of the vaccinations

. Spay surgery

. Flea/tick, and heartworm prevention

. A good brand of food + supplements

. Misc supplies (crate, collar, and toys)

. Hygiene care (toothbrush/nail clippers/brush/shampoo)

. And money for basic veterinary check ups every few months + a couple hundred extra in savings for an emergency

And so I brought her home. And everything was going good.

Until she was diagnosed with hip dysplasia before she was even a year old.

I NEVER thought that a dog as young as her would get hip dysplasia. I was completely unprepared for this. She now needs one, possibly two, 8000$ hip replacements that I absolutely cannot afford. 
And if I say ANYTHING about this to the dog community, I get absolutely BLASTED with the ""you shouldn't have gotten a dog if you can't afford it.'

But the thing is, I can afford HER. What I can't afford is the spontaneous 8000$ surgery for a condition that is uncommon in her age.

I've seen other dog owners get scorched by the dog community for similar reasons, like ""your dog was poisoned by the neighbor and needs a 10,000$ treatment that you need help paying for? You shouldn't have gotten a dog if you can't afford it."" It absolutely infuriates me.

That being said, if you can't afford ANY sort of basic vet care (check ups, pest prevention, vaccinations, basic accident care) then you should NOT get a dog.

Basically, my point is that owners should not be blamed for not being able to afford/needing people's help to afford extremely expensive, and unpreventable veterinary care.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/x7wt4s/my_take_on_if_you_cant_afford_the_vet_you_cant/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yeah it's not like the future is 100% predicable. No matter how careful you are, dogs aren't robots and stuff can happen. 

When people ask about my recently deceased dog, who lived way way way longer than predicted by his neurologist, I point out that much of that was due to a quick diagnosis, via an MRI and daily oral chemo. 

The diagnosis and MRI ran about $6K. Daily chemo was close to 100 dollars a month.

,"Welcome to the lessons of life. Well in America we do the same thing to people.

Yep you did all the right things and still got a bad shake. 
Truth be told yes you can put a price on a dog's life (also people life, insurance companies do it all the time), yes it's sad and it sucks but that's reality. 

When I got my puppy, before she was a year old she can down with pneumonia, that was about $10k for a week at the vet. Truth be told if she had to go in a second time like that within the same year I wouldn't be able to pull it off and her pulling though would be a roll of the dice of life as I have maxed out of $15k for puppy emergencies for the year. 

For a new dog like yours it going to be a hard life for that pup, it will be costly financially and time. This may be way more than what you sign up for. Sorry you got a poor  roll here. 

Now you have to look at what options you have for the dog and try to do your best. It may be working hard and saving up to get the opp done or rehoming to a group or a home that's willing to give the dog a better life. How you handle this challenge will craft your character. 

We all know this isn't how you were expecting dog ownership would be. You face a very challenging decision.

,"My recommendation is that someone can afford the initial costs of the dog (including supplies, check up, etc), the routine costs of the dog (food, training, routine vet care, etc) plus have short notice access to a thousand dollars for emergencies. 

That, to me, is the minimum required to ethically have a dog. You have all your bases covered for anything normal and expected, plus a reasonable amount for something unexpected ($1000 might not cover something like an emergency visit for a major injury with intensive surgery, but it’s enough to get you in the door and treatment started). I also suggest people have a plan for what they’re going to do if there’s an emergency beyond that they can’t afford (can they get credit, a bank loan, borrow from family, etc. and if not, will they euth the dog or try to find a rescue to surrender to, etc. This should ideally be thought about before any emergency happens since it can be hard to know if you made the right decision in the heat of the moment). 

Not being able to afford $8,000 doesn’t make someone a bad pet owner. Euthanizing or surrendering a dog because you can’t afford $8000 doesn’t make them a bad pet owner. The only thing that would make someone a bad pet owner in this circumstance would be refusing treatment — and then letting the dog suffer long term without doing anything.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/x7wt4s/my_take_on_if_you_cant_afford_the_vet_you_cant/#ingabm0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dog was originally a rez dog and probably a stray most it's life. Despite that they've said the dog was very healthy when it cam into care and has no signs of illness. Supposedly it has a very good temperament as well.

When she came into care they had her checked out, spayed and vaccinated.

,"So... here's my take on this as a former vet tech:

I do some work with rescues, and I don't think they'll go for this.  Most vets who work with rescues usually draw blood work as part of the exam, so I think you could easily get that sent over to you to have your vet look at it to see if they notice anything amiss.  

As far as the radiographs, that's most likely not going to happen.  I will point out that most joint disorders (unless they're already moderate to advanced stage) take multiple radiographs over a period of time to accurately diagnose.  So you getting ONE x-ray probably isn't going to tell you what you really want to know.  

Younger dogs are less likely to have joint issues off the bat, and you can definitely get breeds that are less prone to joint disorders.  As the animals age, however, you're more than likely going to have something come up (like arthritis or hip dysplasia).  

I would look at adopting a younger adult dog from a breed that is less likely to have joint issues in your case.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1exspeo/should_i_do_health_testing_on_rescue_dog_before/#lj8gm6o,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you do something like SAR or detection and you're wanting to adopt a working partner, no, I don't think it's overkill. You're going to invest A LOT of time / energy / resources into training her for this job, so I think it's reasonable to make sure she's healthy enough to have a long career.

If she's just going to be a pet or casual sports partner, I do think it's a little overkill. If you want as close to a health and temperament guarantee as you can get, I'd probably go through a breeder. Otherwise, I'd just accept rescue dogs will be a bit of a roll of the dice.

"[Discussion] The downside of ""adopt don't shop""
The upside of the ""adopt don't shop"" movement is that it has led to more dogs being adopted from shelters. That is a wonderful thing. I have worked in multiple shelters and owned many rescued animals, and I've seen firsthand how wonderful it is for an abandoned dog to get a forever home. 

The downside is that it's contributed to a mass misunderstanding that buying any dog is always equally unethical. Puppy mills and backyard breeders are what cause overpopulation and euthanasia. A reputable breeder breeds infrequently, health tests the parents, typically sells with limited registration and a spay/neuter contract (so the pet dogs aren't then subjected to future backyard breeding), provides thorough vet care and proper socialization, thoroughly screens potential owners, and will take back the dog at any point in its lifetime. They tightly control their lines and take full responsibility for every dog they produce. All the puppies are typically reserved before they're even born. These breeders are not contributing to the shelter population. 

But there is so much hatred for ALL breeders that people intentionally avoid them even when they have decided they want a purebred. I have a good friend (a great, well meaning person) who bought a puppy from a guy on a farm whose dog accidentally had puppies because she ""didn't want to buy from a breeder."" She took this puppy home at six weeks (illegally young to be separated from mom) and she was absolutely riddled with worms because she received no vet care. I'm sure the farmer will breed his dog again now that he's seen the kind of demand there is for poodle mixes. 

 Another friend of mine bought a purebred dog off Craigslist because, again, she figured all purchased dogs were equal. This was a brachycephalic breed known for health problems. Parents of course had no health testing. The dog is a health disaster. She hasn't neutered the dog (backyard breeders don't care if you do) and is considering breeding him despite the fact that he is a runt with serious breathing issues and constant inflammation. 

The majority of purebred puppies are bought from puppy mills or backyard breeding situations. THIS IS WHERE OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE! We need to continue to encourage shelter adoption but ALSO  uplift good breeders, push for more regulations on breeding (not just banning it), and educate people on how to buy a purebred dog more ethically. 

Thoughts?",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/iq5xcj/discussion_the_downside_of_adopt_dont_shop/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Kudos for using the term ""poodle mixes"" instead of whatever idiotic marketable names they are given.

Some people will buy a puppy from a pet store, in a well-meaning way, and they'll think they rescued it because the conditions were so bad. Problem is, they're feeding the demand that leads to supply in the supply/demand cycle. Once that tiny glass kennel is empty, guess what that store is going to do? They're going to get a new one to fill it. 

I've worked in a very large, hi -volume shelter, which I saw manage to get to 0 space euthanasia for years -- meaning they did not have to kill any adoptable animals for to make space, and they were able to repeat this milestone. The ""Adopt Dont Shop"" publicity did a lot to help, as well as showing the public that you \*can\* get purebreds from shelters. 

But breeding will ALWAYS have a place. At the very least, some people really do NEED purpose-bred dogs, like people with service dogs. And having worked with a ton of shelter dogs, most of which are pit bulls, I can say I don't fault anyone for choosing an ethically sourced puppy of a breed they want if they can't find what they're looking for at a shelter. Some people have cats or other dogs. They don't want to bring home a strange pit bull. It's not a breed for everyone, but for-profit backyard breeders continue to pump them out at insane rates. Anyway, imho, if you went to the shelter and fought 20 other people over the most desirable golden retriever puppy that happened to end up there, you can't claim moral superiority over someone who went to a breeder for one. You didn't rescue that puppy. That puppy was guaranteed a home the second it got here. 

And sometimes shelters and rescues are run in such a way that makes going to a breeder the only logical choice. Rescues especially can have ridiculous standards for dogs they have acquired from shelters, which are sometimes only there because they failed behavioral or health testing for shelter adoption in the first place. Rescues can be shady, and lie about a dog's history or ability to get along with others. 

So as good as the adoption trend has been, it still doesn't give people a place to condemn all breeding, and the pretense of moral superiority of ""rescuing"" a dog should be avoided.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/iq5xcj/discussion_the_downside_of_adopt_dont_shop/#g4rn5ik,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I agree with the ""adopt or shop rrsponsibily"" mindset for this very reason, but I came here to say that not every shelter is honest with their dogs either. A prime example is my chihuahua mix. I was browsing a website called FindAPet or something like that (was over 10 years ago so don't remember the name, but it was a collection of animals from shelters that needed homes and a very popular website at the time) and came across a beautiful little chihuahua mix. She looked young and so adorable so I made the decision to go look at her..

She was at a personal home of the particular rescuer owners with several other dogs and was very, very scared looking. She wouldn't go anywhere near people at all. I asked tons of questions and was told she was ""completely healthy and maybe a year old at most."" I fell in love because I could tell she just needed some love and attention. So I got her. 

I took her to a vet shortly after adopting her to check her out. Turns out she was actually 2-3 years old and already had had a litter of puppies, had a severe allergy to grass, pollen, fleas, and some grains; one ear had a deformity inside; the opposite eye to that ear didn't produce tears; she had sliding kneecaps; and a stomach hernia.

I couldn't take her back because in that short week she became my second shadow and I knew she was probably abandoned because of those health problems. Instead I got pet insurance and took her monthly to get the medications she needed to help her conditions and bought the special foods and other things for her, even though I really couldn't afford it at the time. 

Fast forward 10+ years and she's still my baby. She's deaf and blind now, but she's had one hell of a life with me and has travelled to numerous states and seen a lot of love she may not have ever had the chance to experience. I've spent thousands of dollars on her between 3 ear surgeries, allergy shots and medications, eye drops she'd need just to be able to close her eyes, and countless other vet visits, but I wouldn't change that now because of the unconditional love this dog has given me. She really has been a soulmate... But I shudder to think of what could have happened to her if someone else had gotten to her first. 

Dishonesty is rampant everywhere - from breeders to rescue shelters. Humans in general suck. Even after doing all the research you can, things can still go wrong. Just don't give up on the animals. It's not their fault that humans are shitty. All they want is for someone to love them so they can love you back.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/iq5xcj/discussion_the_downside_of_adopt_dont_shop/#g4ppqn7,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"And before anyone says ""but for every dog you buy, a dog dies in a shelter"" I want to counter this. 

- Every time you adopt a puppy from a shelter, an older dog dies in the shelter. 

- For every healthy adult poodle mix someone adopts from a shelter, an adult pit bull with health issues dies in the shelter. 

- Every time you go hiking in the mountains, you could instead be picking up trash on the beaches. Every time you play video games, you could be volunteering at a soup kitchen.

"[Discussion] Why do we still crop and dock (cutting off ears and tails) dogs in 2018 like it is the most normal thing to do?
I know this discussion is probably going to hurt my karma as people will get very defensive but I am really curious as to why folks are still doing it in 2018 like it is the most normal thing? Even the American kennel club is still supporting cropping and docking. The American Veterinarian Association as well as all of the rescue organization have taken a clear stance AGAINST it, calling it unnecessary pain inflicted on the pets for simply looks. There are medically necessary instances of cropping and docking and some working breeds that are actually working and not home pets so I am not talking about that and those instances are not discouraged by the vet association. We are talking about docking/cropping simply because people like the looks or do it for shows.

We have a doberman and she has her ears and tail and people stop or cross the street to take pictures of her. Out of 1000 people 999 tell us how happy they are we left her all natural and how much happier, friendlier, and prettier she looks. The vet told us that we avoided several possible health issues by not cropping and docking and that the dog is socially more balanced as she can communicate with her tail and ears with other dogs. You see pictures of her here: [https://twitter.com/ValleyAllNatual](https://twitter.com/ValleyAllNatual) (feel free to post your dog pics on there to show them off) :D

So I hope that this might give some folks food for thought to NOT crop or dock and leave their dogs natural. Just tell your breeder this is how you want your dog and your are paying for it so you should have the last word.

Also, the veterinarian association stated that there is no harm but only benefits in keeping tails and ears and that the myth of the dog breaking their tails if they are not docked is simply that--a myth. The Vet Association reports less than 0.1% annual incidents of tail injuries in their practices.

So why, in 2018, are we still cutting off a dog's primary part of his/her communication for looks? I personally agree with my vet ant the veterinary association and find it rather cruel to do it simply for looks. Of course most other civilized nations are ahead of us again and have long banned cropping and docking of dogs and cats calling is cruel and painful.

I am not calling people who have dogs with cropped ears and docked tails heartless abusers. I am sure people are not aware of the damage it does to an animal and the pain it inflicts during their puppyhood. But it might be time to have an open mind and look into the arguments of the vet association and factor that in for future furry babies that are breeds where cropping and docking is common.

PLEASE READ this for the facts: [https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Frequently-asked-questions-about-canine-tail-docking.aspx](https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Frequently-asked-questions-about-canine-tail-docking.aspx)

p.s. when we told breeders that we would like to keep our dog all natural most yelled at us and called us hippies. Maybe 2 out of 10 breeders were ok with it. Those 2 stated they are not obsessed with showing the dogs at competitions and actually prefer leaving it on. This is our first not adopted pet as we needed a puppy for our older cats as we wanted to avoid issues such as chasing cats/seeing them as prey.

,"My beautiful childhood schnauzer-mix was an ugly  matted mess when we adopted him from the shelter. Didn’t even know what he was. 

After a bath and a groom, when we went to pick him up he looked like a different dog. A schnauzer dog, with adorable floppy uncropped ears and a worst of whatever breeds he had tail, it was thin with whispy black hairs that grew off of it. The worst version of a schnauzer’s ungroomed tail. 

In those days, you never saw a schnauzer undocked, tail or ears. People never commented on his tail, most of what we would get was “OMG, is that a schnauzer? With his EARS? Uggggg, he is soooo cute! I’ve never seen that!” Occasionally, wed get a “purist” who would ask us why we never had him cropped. And my wonderful mother would tell them, “because it’s cruel and unnecessary.”

Thankfully, about his mid-life the don’t dock trend started. And I can’t remember the last time I saw a schnauzer with docked ears at least. (Still see tails occasionally)

Shout out to my sweet sweet Percival, who in my mind I like to believe his love of life was enough to start a trend of non-docking. My best buddy from 2 to 18 who still loved me, even when I played zoo with him under the laundry basket and adorned him with strands of toilet paper (I apologized and he accepted years later) and who even after he went deaf and near blind and had arthritis would still somehow know to make his way up the stairs to come knock on my door in my teenage years when I really thought I wanted to die.

With working dogs it certainly is no myth.

My Lab is an all-rounder and is expected to work hedgerows & cover, to flush game as well as retrieve. As such there's hardly a day in the field goes by where at some point he comes out of cover with his undocked tail covered in at least a small amount of blood.

He's never had any serious damage and so far it's always been superficial, but none the less this time of year the very tip of his tail is a constant mess of scabs & scar tissue.

Actual flushing breeds (spaniels for instance) have it far worse as they tend to hit cover with far more vigor, and if undocked this can cause very severe tail injuries.

"[Discussion] I think it’s time to change the narrative of good breeding to be about health testing.
Hi everyone!


I’m posting here because the infamous designer dog topic has been coming back up. As a bonus, this argument also works against BYBs and mills as a whole, designer dog or purebred.


Do I think there is anyone reputable breeding designer dogs? No. Do I think that they are necessary because they fill a niche? Absolutely not.


Do I think that people get turned off by the purebred narrative? Absolutely.


So, instead, I’ve been trying to teach people about the OFA guidelines for each breed, how to tell if the breeder has done them, and the importance of actually checking the database to make sure they are done (and updated as needed).


Because I can argue all I want that a well-bred poodle has a more predictable temperament and standard than a doodle, argue about how important titling is, and talk about how purebreds are not inbred like everyone thinks they are—but that won’t resonate with the general public.


However, if I start talking about health testing, there’s literally no good argument you can make against it. Someone tried to argue with me about hybrid vigor, so I used this example:


“If a lab with hip dysplasia is bred to a poodle with hip dysplasia, will the puppies magically have excellent hips?”


That seemed to work. This is a reminder that there are specific health conditions that certain breeds are prone to, hip dysplasia being a common example.


This was sparked by me making the mistake of trying to talk to people on doodle subs. I told them that they should absolutely care about if their dog’s parents are properly OFA tested, but I was told that “some people don’t care about health testing”.


Imagine this: you are paying a significant amount of money for this dog, likely 3k+ for any given designer dog. You SHOULD care if their parents are health tested. If the breeder is breeding without checking their stock for health tests (which is probably poor anyway, but that’s an argument for another day), then they are INTENTIONALLY breeding knowing that they have a higher chance of passing issues like these on. All to male a bigger profit, which is greedy and selfish.


Of course, genetics are not as simple as that. You can have five generations of excellent hips and have a puppy with early hip dysplasia, but it’s much less likely to occur in that puppy than it would be in a pup who’s parents had poor hips.


A breeder on one of the doodle subs told me they don’t bother to test for hips because hip dysplasia can still occur. And, technically, they are correct, but they are purposely not testing when they could be decreasing the likelihood of hip dysplasia in their offspring. That is abhorrent behavior from a breeder, who should be trying to improve their “breed” in any way they possibly can.


A person who wants to buy a puppy of any breed or mix cannot argue that health testing is not important. If you buy a puppy from someone who doesn’t do health testing, then do not expect a healthy dog.


I was so irked when someone told me that they don’t care that their breeder doesn’t health test their dogs. If you support a breeder that does not fully health test, you are supporting irresponsible breeding. You are supporting greedy, selfish people who are breeding to make a quick buck.


You should be supporting the people who work their asses off to improve their breed by titling, trialing, and studying pedigrees, but most importantly, health testing according to breed club standards.

,"Designer breeding annoys me because most of the time it's done for specific colorings or to support a myth. (Such as the hypoallergenic hype). 

The one that's been bothering me lately is ""american corgis"" which is simply a pembroke and a cardigan breed together to get merles on pembroke looking corgi. I mean, what was wrong with the originals? It has lead to poor practices of double breeding merles in the attempt to get more of that coat. 

My girl is a mutt. Shes half corgi, half blue heeler. She was born of an opps litter. Person breeds corgis, another person breed heelers. Due to hurricane damage the dogs got out and my little girl was born. But because both breeders were responsible they were able to provide me with all the tests needed, included tempermwnt testing (so important in bull headed cattle herders).

I found out later that people have started doing this on purpose and call them ""cowboy corgis"". Adorable name, I admit, but not a true breed and most ""cowboy breeders"" I have since researched out of curiosity couldn't even provide a fraction of the testing, vet papers etc that these two breeders could with a weather related accidental litter. 

I also tend to find price a good base line. If some one is charging an obscene amount for what is literally a mutt, they probably are in it for the quick buck. My girl cost the less then adopting a dog from a shelter would because again, she was an opps litter and the breeders only wanted to make what they spent at the vet, they werent selling mixed breeds for profit.

"Is it normal to feel this way about a dog?
I waited until I was 32 years old to get my first pet. I had no idea how challenging and rewarding raising a puppy into a dog would be. I know that a pet dog is not equivalent to a human child- but as a woman who isn't having children, he is the closest I will probably ever get. 

I used to be such a miserable morning person... but ever since he came into my life, I wake up every single morning smiling and saying ""Good Morning"" as he licks my face. I have trained him almost everything he knows, but he has taught me more than I ever could have imagined - about patience, empathy, love, and connection. 

I am fortunate to be able to bring him to work with me, so I am literally almost always with him. We go on so many fun adventures together ... we commute together.. we work together....we are very bonded, and he is really like my little shadow. I have truly never had a better friend. Maybe that speaks to my bad luck with friends, or maybe it is reminiscent of man's relationship to dog. 

I have nursed him back to health twice after illnesses - I have happily cleaned up poop, puke, and blood. Almost everything I do is with him in mind - what is best for him, what would make him happy and fulfilled. 

I have struggled with depression and addiction in my life....somedays, he is my sole reason...my reason for staying here...my reason for being the best version of myself that I can be. I am digging myself out of almost 30k in debt just so that I can buy a house with a big fenced in back yard ...for him. 

He is only 1 year old. I try so hard to just live in the present and enjoy the time we have together but another part of me is sometimes angry at myself....because I have already experienced so much loss and have so much trauma around abandonment that the idea that he won't be here forever just breaks me. Most days, I just enjoy what we have....but every once in a while, this little voice inside says, ""This is really going to hurt."" He is just always here... and to imagine him not here one day kills me. 

I truly fear the day he's not here anymore. I had a lot of pets growing up and love animals, but I truly feel there will never be another him. It scares the shit out of me and breaks my heart. He really is my everything. 

One of my favorite family dogs passed away 5 years ago and every once in a while I still get teary eyed about it....It is hard to fathom what I am going to feel when it is my boy. My best friend. 

Is it normal to be so attached to a dog? To think about the end when he is still so young? How do you get over these intrusive thoughts?

,"While our pets may live much shorter lives than we do, we still spend a lot of years with them. And a lot of hours of our days. 

My dog Bo passed at age 16 in 2021. I had him for 13 years. You don’t spend that many years with someone and not experience loss when they pass. I’m a childfree woman, and he was my whole world. I suffer from depression, and there were definitely days that the only reason I got out of bed was to feed and walk him.

As heartbroken as I was when I had to make the decision to let him go, I knew I was doing the right thing for him. And yes I cried every day for months. I still miss him. But I wouldn’t trade all those years with him for anything. In time I was ready to bring another dog into my life. He helped me continue healing.

"Is it so bad for a dog to sleep overnight in a crate even as adults?
Hopefully I don't get ripped to shreds for this as it seems a lot of people are very anti-crate. Mine is still pretty young, not a teeny puppy but not an adult yet, so it's not something I've committed to yet, but she's my first dog so I'm wondering: what is so bad about having adult dogs sleep in a crate overnight? I know it's recommended as young puppies for potty training purposes and because they are nuts and get into all kinds of trouble at that age, but if they're like mine and seem to love the crate with a nice soft bed and blankets, it's a good size and big enough for them to easily stand all the way up and turn around and reposition, they sleep quietly in there overnight and go in voluntarily for naps during the day, they never start whining or barking in it or otherwise showing they want out, and you know they're safe in there and not getting into anything they shouldn't, is it terrible to continue to have them sleep in there overnight indefinitely? Not looking for opinions from the ""why don't you love your dog enough to cuddle in the bed with them??"" crowd, especially since frankly mine is too big for the amount of space we have in our bed at night. Just from a dog health and happiness perspective, I'm curious, is there really anything wrong with it? It makes me feel better knowing she's safe while we sleep, so I'd probably continue to do it for a while unless she ever starts to seem unhappy about it",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1iuosou/is_it_so_bad_for_a_dog_to_sleep_overnight_in_a/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"[Vent] My dogs health is beginning to decline and it's heartbreaking
Just a couple of months ago I brought my dog in to have his teeth cleaned because I thought they were bothering him and wasn't eating as much as usual. Thinking nothing of it I dropped him off and got a call later that day saying ""we're not going to put him under anesthesia given his condition."" Me being a totally clueless asked what? Come to find out he has dangerous levels of liver enzymes in his lab work and we decided to put him on medication and follow it up with an ultrasound with specialist. Which is exactly what I do. The doctor starts talking about wanting to do a biopsy and I just remember sitting in the room with doctor, with my ears just ringing being the only thing I can hear in the room. Exactly like the scene in Breaking Bad when he gets diagnosed.

Here I was thinking not even 2 weeks prior to that I have a more or less perfectly healthy dog and it just turns out he's going down hill. I walked out from that vet visit and just started bawling my eyes out like a little kid. Brody is my best friend who's been with me through so much. A couple heartbreak, being a broke college student, career failures, but the one static thing I had was coming home to his goofy face and brightening my day every day.

Today, after waiting about waiting about 8 weeks after the initial blood draw we did another. His enzyme levels got much worse. I was hopeful considering he had a better appetite and better energy, but I was wrong. Brody just turned 9. I thought I had a few more good years, but that no longer looks to be the case. I'm heartbroken and really just feel lost emotionally. I feel so foolish and dumb for not catching it sooner.

Put up with the medicine schedule, the appointments and the unavoidable messes in the house. 

Don't forget to do some version of the things he loved when he was healthy. My favorite dog ever (Dave the Golden Retriever) loved playing ball more than anything. I could still get a wag out of him when he could barely walk by showing him the ball and handing it to him. Annnnd I'm crying.

"At what point do we stop “doodling”?
This is no hate to unaware doodle owners or the dogs themselves. It’s the unethical breeders. Four of my neighbors just got puppies for Christmas time and they are a mini Bernedoodle, a beagle/poodle, a border collie/poodle, and a Rottweiler/poodle. I honestly just can’t believe we have reached this place of mixing every single dog breed with a poodle. It seems like that’s what every one wants, some sort of poodle mix while simultaneously “not liking poodles”..? Is the only draw that they are “hypoallergenic”? Why is everyone so against a poodle that it has to be mixed with a completely incompatible breed? Even then there are other dogs breeds to pick from that look like doodles already?

"Owners of well bred dogs who previously owned poorly bred dogs, did you notice a difference in health?
i’m looking to get a well bred dog soon, and have heard a lot of people say that their well bred dog had saved them so much money in vet bills. i know this has to be true in some degree because of the amount of time and effort that is put into finding the healthiest possible dogs for your breeding program, but i’m curious to hear other peoples stories.

edit: i feel like i need to clarify what i mean by well bred. purebred does NOT equal well bred. neither does health testing on the parents. neither is the parents being titled and successful in dog shows. are those all important parts that make up a well bred dog? Yes! is your dog well bred because it meets one of those things? NO! a well bred dog has a breeder that is willing to put in hours and days into socializing and picking the best possible homes for a litter. a well bred dog has parents who are OFA or Pennhip health tested as well as genetically tested.

"Breeder cancelled our contract and told us we aren't suitable for any dog
I am really shaken and not sure what to think.

Earlier this week, my partner and I had received a contract for a puppy, from a reputable breeder we had been talking with. We were excited, this was a breed we had been following for some time and it seemed like the stars were aligning - I am just about to reduce my work hours and will have more time to raise a puppy.

The puppy was about $2000, on the cheaper end for purebred puppies in Australia. We found out that this is because the puppy is already 4.5 months old and won't come with papers. We were a bit surprised, but we knew the breeder shows dogs, judges dogs and active globally in this breed's community - so we trusted her when she said it was because the litter was larger than expected and that they were not any show quality dogs in the litter.

So we signed the paperwork, but before sending it over we wanted to ask some follow up questions about the puppies temperament. We know this age is critical for puppies socialisation and the puppy schools I had called said that at 4.5 months, the puppy was just too old for puppy school - so we wanted to target training for when the puppy arrived.

So we called, for what would be our third conversation with the breeder. But when we started asking questions she cut us off, and said we should go look at rescues. Shocked, my partner started to apologise for miscommunication but she hung up on us mid sentence. She then texted she was cancelling the contract.

We were shocked. We've never had a call like that.

20 mins later we received an email saying that she was not a ""fortune teller"" and couldn't tell us about whether the puppy would get along with cats and other dogs. She went on to say that we were unsuitable for any dog, as we clearly wanted ""guarantees on every aspect of health, character and behaviour"". Further that we should be ""incredibly grateful"" for the opportunity to buy her purebred puppies.

Did we do the wrong thing? I think asking questions is good, but is it possible we came across as extremely obnoxious instead of responsible? I've been researching puppy care and reputable breeders for a while and now I feel really shaken to be told we would be a bad home for dogs.

Some other relevant info:

* We couldn't receive the puppy immediately because of work travel - so the breeder was holding the puppy for us for another 2.5 weeks and maybe that's why she thought we should have been more grateful? After our first call when we said that we understood that she needed to get the puppy into a home ASAP, but she came back to us saying she rather lock in a home.
* No health documentation was provided, and so we previously asked about what tests had been taken on puppies and their parents. She seemed annoyed and noted the parents were show champions and the puppies vet checked - no other tests because the breed was rare.
* we did not see the puppy/home outside of photos, as the breeder was interstate and we did not videocall. So perhaps we asked too many obvious questions?

Edit: Hey everyone thanks so much for your comments and support. I didn't expect so many replies! But really grateful and I'll read them all. Feeling a bit better about what happened.

What breed? 

It is really hard to know if there was something y'all said that was a red flag because we obviously weren't part of those initial conversations.

For the future , you want to ask about puppy socialization and what is done to prepare them for your home. So, for me, health testing was on top of my list, and socialization was second. Their first socialization period is 3- 8 weeks old, and your breeder can do a lot to help you have an ""easy"" puppy. Nothing is for sure since things can happen, so theirs no way to tell if they will be cat or dog friendly their whole life or even like every animal they meet.

"My Girl (5Y) Died of Cancer 8 Months Ago—Need Help Finding a Breed that Suits Me and Info on How to Avoid Significant Health Issues.  
Hello Everyone! I'm sorry for being another annoying breed recommendation post, but I'd really love the help of more knowledgeable people in looking on what breed fits my lifestyle and some recommendations for further research.

  
**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
   * No. I've had dogs all my life. My girl, Bean, was the first puppy I've ever owned and trained (very successfully; she was often mistaken for a service dog due to how well she followed commands and her attention to her handler, me). However, I have lived with dogs my entire life. 
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
   * I've never purchased a dog and would like to rescue, but I am afraid of potential health issues  like Bean's, which is forcing me to consider purchasing a puppy from a reputable breeder with proven healthy lineages. 
3. Describe your ideal dog.
   * I'd love a cuddly dog, handler-focused, clingy, and energetic but not so much as a working breed. I also LOVE dogs with goofy personalities, but that's more specific to the dog and less to a breed, I assume. 
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
   * Aesthetically, I love Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Anatolian Shepards, Rottweilers, and American Alsatians (which I recently heard are BYB dogs, which really put a damper on things, since they sounded pretty perfect to me). I just LOVE a huge dog with a big ole head and floppy ears. I also love Pitties/Bullies, but I can't really narrow it down to one specific breed, since I've only ever had pittie mix rescues. I just don't know enough about breed standards to provide a standard I'm interested in. I don't typically like curly haired breeds.
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
   * Basic obedience and possibly dog sports, if the breed has more intense enrichment needs. This would be a companion dog, not a working dog.
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
   * No desire/need to compete or have the dog work, but I'm willing to do anything to meet my dog's needs.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

   * At least an hour to two hours a day, but I was planning on leaving them at training/ doggy daycare while I work so that they get appropriate enrichment time. I enjoy training, playing, and walking with my dog and would love a dog that can both do that and also is happy to lay in bed with me on a lazy sunday. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

   * I volunteer at my local shelter and have done animal handling training, which makes me believe that dog parks are unnecessarily dangerous to dogs and can put undue stress on them because of the mixed playstyles and constant rotation of new players. I will not be doing dog parks. I like nature walks, short hikes, taking my dog out on the town (to dog-friendly areas), and I have a large backyard. I'd also walk them at least once a day on top of our outdoor time. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

   * I can groom regularly at home but am much more likely to pay a professional. My Bean was a short-haired bully mix and got groomed every 2-3 weeks. I love long-haired dogs but am afraid they'll overheat (Florida). 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

   * L-XL breeds. The bigger the better so long as their average lifespan is above 10. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

   * All of it. No such thing as too much from my baby. I deep clean regularly.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

   * Not at all. I have a fenced backyard and never let my dog off-leash in public due to danger from people or other dogs' behavior. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

   * Snugglebug. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

   * Either is fine. 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

   * Friendly is preferred, but Aloof is fine. I would not like a dog breed prone to reactivity. Of course, I will be training and de-sensitizing, but there are some more prone to reactivity than others, as you know.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

   * No. I would prefer that they are either ambivalent or dog-friendly, as I work with many dogs and would like to continue fostering.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

   * High prey drive cannot be a factor, I have two cats and foster. I would prefer if they were friendly to small animals or felt the need to protect them, as my deceased baby did. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

   * Almost never. There is almost always someone home, but I will be the sole caretaker. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

   * I will be the sole caretaker. The others can let them out to use the bathroom in the backyard, but I will be taking full care of the dog. They have no specific preferences outside of wanting a dog that will not harm other dogs or cats.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

   * Two cats. My mom, whom I live with, has a small lhasapoo that she rescued.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

   * No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

   * No. I own.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

   * No breed restrictions. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

   * An average summer day is about 95 F with a Feels Like temp that CAN hit 106 due to high humidity. Typical winter day is around 70 F, but sometimes dips below 50 F (not frequently, maybe 30 days total in a year and always scattered between several winter months). 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

   * My Bean died of osteosarcoma and I am petrified of another serious illness like osteosarcoma or hemangiosarcoma. I know must dog breeds suffer from cancer, but I would appreciate any feedback on how to lessen their odds of having to go through that. 

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

"[Discussion] The difference between a backyard bred puppy and a puppy from a reputable breeder.
I wanted to share my experience with a byb puppy and a puppy from a reputable breeder and encourage others to share their experiences as well!

I'll be the first to admit, I got my first dog from a backyard breeder. I really didn't know what I was doing and thought it was all fine at the time. Lesson learned! I currently own that dog, she's about 3.5, and now have a new puppy from a reputable breeder.

&#x200B;

**Acquiring the puppy:**

*BYB:* I found the puppy on puppyfind. She was 6 weeks old and I paid a deposit to pick her up in 2 weeks. The breeder didn't ask anything about me-- I was 18, living in a studio apartment and definitely buying a puppy impulsively. When my boyfriend and I picked her up, the puppies were kept in the basement. 

*Reputable breeder:* I found the breeder on the American Shetland Sheepdog Association page. She didn't have any puppies available but pushed for us to talk on the phone to get to know me. We talked for 30 minutes and I learned a lot about her, like the health issues in her line, the success she's had, and how long she's been involved in the breed (40 years!). We agreed to keep in contact. Eventually she let me know when she had pups. Every week she'd send pictures and updates. We were able to meet the pups before we picked ours up. She gave us the choice between two very similar puppies. 

**Puppy's parents:**

*BYB:* When we picked up the puppy, we were able to meet the dad, he was pretty shy but sweet. We saw the mom. The mom was kept in a separate fenced in yard; they told us she was upset about her puppies leaving so we weren't able to meet her. I know now she probably was reactive and shy, not upset her pups were leaving. 

*Reputable breeder:* We were able to meet the mom. She was friendly, which is great because the breed can tend to be shy. We were unable to meet the dad, but he is a confident and goofy dog. I was able to find a couple videos of him at dog shows. He's a gold grand champion which is pretty cool. Both parents were fully health tested.

**Puppy socialization**

*BYB:* I'm not sure this person even knew what socialization means. I highly doubt the puppies even left the basement. Our puppy came very shy and afraid of everything. She was very antisocial and did not care about us at all. Pretty much immediately she was reactive and remained that way until about 2 years old, despite constant training from 8 weeks on.

*Reputable breeder*: She exposed the puppies to handling, nail clipping, baths, blow dries, tons of different toys and objects, ramps, tunnels, different surfaces... you get the idea. This puppy is confident and happy. Even if she is afraid of something, she bounces back very quickly. She's very social and loves to give kisses. The breeder worked very hard on bite inhibition, and the puppy barely bites.

**Lifetime support**

*BYB:* They only wanted money. They did not provide any support for us, I don't even remember their name. They never checked in on us after.

*Reputable breeder*: Insists on lifetime support and updates on the puppy. She called a few days after we got the puppy to check in and see how things were going. We're actually going to see her this weekend so she can help us with the puppy's ears (sheltie ears are glued/taped when young to get a proper tip).  She knows several people who will be able to mentor me in agility. She offers a lifetime health guarantee where if the pup gets a genetic health condition at any point (like dysplasia) you're able to keep the dog but she will give you your money back. She offers dogsitting for $10/day (she only charges because one Thanksgiving they had an extra 15!! shelties) and would take the dog back at any point if needed.

&#x200B;

Sorry this was so lengthy! I now know that it really is worth it to wait for a well-bred pup and pay the extra price up front-- my second pup was twice as much as the byb puppy. I just wanted to share my experience with puppies from both sides of the coin.

,"My experience with a BYB was she was well intentioned and did ask questions and had a rudimentary knowledge (in retrospect). 

However once I had the puppies and they got to 9 months and were reactive and I learned so much more about dog training/breeding etc I realized the mother was fearful and in fact after I brought my dogs to the trainer the BYB girl recommended, the trainer told me she had seen the mother before and had worked on fear/reactivity type issues.

The BYB girl genuinely tried to do the right thing - she did recommend the positive trainer and had semblance of breeder clauses etc. BUT a person who *really* understood genetics would not breed a fearful Jack Russell in the first place. So i have sweet dogs in general but they are a handful because of their fear issues. A fearful terrier will bite first and ask questions later. 

I just think when people think BYB their mind goes to horror stories of filthy dogs in cages when it can be as simple as getting a puppy from  parents passing on questionable temperament.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/hrp5zh/discussion_the_difference_between_a_backyard_bred/#fy5qtql,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through word of mouth we found a gentleman about 30 minutes away that is a third generation Chesapeake breeder.  He knows his lines and is extremely particular about the studs he chooses for his females.  We had to wait a year, but it was worth it.  We were able to interact with the mother, all the puppies were huge with gorgeous coats, and he had already started them on potty training and retrieving duck wings.  Pups were AKC registered, immunized, and $600 (half the cost of the first “breeder” we went to).  He does not charge more than that because he said he’s not in it for the money, he wants his dogs going to good families that will take their dog hunting and swimming.  I can call or text him anytime with questions.

,"As someone who works as a rescue for giant breeds my advice would be to please do your research! We can only do so much as far as our background checks go, we rely on people being honest and your references to be honest. We get so many dogs because people haven't done enough research to realize a giant eats as much as an adult human, or that because they are human size their vet bills can be quite steep. Look into what common health issues the breed you are getting has and see if the cure is within your budget. Also check out food, if it's an active dog you should feed them high quality protein food-can you afford that? Many overbred dogs come with massive amounts of issues, I have 3 friends who all purchased dogs from reputable breeders only to have all of them needing thousands in medical bills. Also can you afford a dog walker or sitter if that's needed.

Yes, rescue is great but you don’t always get exactly what you want from a rescue and if going to a reputable breeder ensures you get the exact right dog for your lifestyle then that’s better for you and him in the long run.

,"There are two approaches to this, both which are desperately needed to improve the longevity of these breeds.   
   
1) Breeders need to be doing thorough health and genetic screens and breed for health and longevity. While health and genetics can (and should be) tested early and before breeding, you can't always predict longevity and health issues later in life, so it creates a challange because often a dog's prime breeding years are long before you know what will happen in their old age. However only breeding animals from particularly healthy and long-lived lines as well as collecting and storing sperm from young animals to use later could help swing the livespan higher through the breeding of healthier, longer lived animals.   
   
2) Aging isn't just genetics, a large part of it is environmental. We know that decreased caloric intake, certain diets and plenty of exercise are an important part of exending both health span and life span. Making sure that these dogs eat a healthy diet, are kept lean and given a lot of exercise from a young age will certainly help with overall health, and contribute to a longer livespan.   
   
As someone who works in an aging-related research field and has a Great Dane, this topic has always been one of my passions. I want to see these incredible animals have long, rich and fulfilling lives. And I'm proud to say, so far at 10 years of age, my boy is still doing great, so I think we're on the right path",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17yw8wx/dogs_such_as_bernese_mountain_dogs_and_great/#k9we887,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"There are actually some pretty cool out-crossing programs going on for Danes and Berners to help with the lifespans. Essentially what happens is through a very carefully monitored program, dogs are out-crossed to other breeds and then bred back to standard. One of the well known examples of this is with dalmatians, where the projects goal was to remove the genetic predisposition for urinary stones. That I know of, there are also ones going on with pugs, french bulldogs and cavalier king Charles spaniels.

This isn't the same as, like, doodles or something. The goal is to improve the health of the base breed, not make a new one or introduce new problems. All participating dogs are put through the required testing of their breeds. The puppies are given to homes aware of the program and ready to participate if their dogs are declared a good fit; those not a good fit are spayed/neutered and live perfectly well as normal pets.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17yw8wx/dogs_such_as_bernese_mountain_dogs_and_great/#k9welpv,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"IMO The best approach to these problems is:
1. De-center harmful physical traits like oversize. Most giant breeds are even bred to a size excessively over their breed standards. Which is unacceptable, not because it’s over the standard, but because it’s harmful. 

2. Make ethical outcrossing the norm. We need to let go of the idea that every breed needs to be a typey Hapsburg-equivalent. Let dogs have more genetic diversity and prioritize long-term fitness. 

3. Return the old meaning or “purebred”. If there isn’t a specific purpose to select for a trait (for example, herding behaviors in sheepdogs), that trait doesn’t need to be selected for.

Open books are the norm in many domestic species and they tend to be a lot healthier because of it.

,"The puppies aren't health tested, the parents are health tested before being bred. The majority of health tests are only done/results considered valid only if the dog is an adult, so while they may test younger dogs (not usually young puppies though), those results are only preliminary and the dog is supposed to be tested again as an adult. There are some health tests like, off the top of my head, I think like, BAER testing for hearing is done on puppies, but typically on breeds (or suspected individual puppies) that can wind up deaf. Also I guess technically dna testing can be done on the puppies. But I don't know of many other tests done on young puppies.

A lot of breeders will only do genetic tests like with Pawprint genetics or Embark genetics, and say they've been health tested. Those genetic tests can cover the some of the genetic tests that may be mentioned on the OFA/breed club page, but won't cover like actual hip and elbow and heart evaluations. Most breeds have more testing needed than just the genetic ones, and for many diseases even if they have a genetic test, the results of that test isn't necessarily the only determiner of the disease. For example, Dobies with DCM, I think there are 2 different genes you can test for DCM, but, you still need to do Echos on the adults since some Dobies have DCM but those gene results would both show as negative, and the same the other way.

On the OFA site, Cane Corsos are supposed to have at minimum these tests before breeding (the ones not marked optional): https://ofa.org/chic-programs/browse-by-breed/?breed=COR. Then if they have results for the optional ones, even better.

Oh, this sub has a wiki about reputable breeders here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/identifying_a_responsible_breeder

Edit to add - Out of curiosity, I clicked through the OFA site to one of the breed clubs, SACCI, and they link to your breeder you are interested in, on their page about health testing breeders, which I think is at least a good sign? Still do your due diligence with double checking that they still health test and are producing dogs that would be good for the service work you want. Maybe /r/service_dogs may know more about how to ask about if the dogs they produce have the service qualities you are looking for? Not really sure, but good luck!

First you need to load the clicker. Bring him to you and get him to sit still. Hit the clicker and then offer him some food from your hand. It's important that you click first and then offer the food. DO NOT reach for the food until AFTER you click.

Keep doing this until he is expecting food when he hears the clicker. It won't take long. Probably a dozen reps or so. 

The next session bring him to you like before. Say the word ""touch"" and touch his snout for a second. Hit the clicker and then offer some food. Repeat this for many reps.

My problem is the dishonesty.  You ever get one of those emails or calls where they say your vet hasn't approved the prescription?  Our clients sure did too.  In fact, Chewy accidentally sent us an email recently that was meant for clients:

&#x200B;

>Dear Pet Parent,  
>  
>Chewy is committed to your pet's health and happiness. Challenging times like these will never change that.  
>  
>We are actively working to contact your veterinarian to get your pet’s prescription approved, so we can deliver your pet’s essential medicine as fast as possible. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to get through as of yet.  
>  
>These are unprecedented times and it may be possible that your vet is extra busy or working reduced hours. If you’d like to help, you can also contact your veterinarian’s office to find out where they are with approvals.  
>  
>Your pet's well-being will always be our top priority and we’re doing everything we can to make sure your order goes through.  
>  
>We appreciate your support. Stay well and find moments of comfort with your pet.

&#x200B;

""We're working oh so hard on getting the prescription to you, if only your vet would approve it!""

What we found from several of our clients: on numerous occasions (or perhaps all), they were sending this email out the *second* they actually sent the email requesting approval from your vet.  Our clinic always printed out and took care of all approvals by noon the day the prescription requests came in.   Yet, we had always dealt with clients angry about how we weren't approving their scripts.  We would have to send approvals multiple times.  In fact we eventually had to disconnect our fax simply because sending Chewy scripts 3-4 times for each request clogged a free phone line and took up a lot of time.   Chewy tended to be the most egregious of the companies to do this.

So instead we stuck with emails which have convenient time stamps...and the ability to bcc them to the client :)

Suddenly, when we started sending these emails to the client with a time stamp from both Chewy's email and our approval, they were calling Chewy instead of us to complain, yelling at customer service when they tried to call the client and claim we weren't approving it, or ditching Chewy altogether.  We got to see both sides ourselves too.  On one fun occasion, we didn't have a medication that our tech needed for her dog but could only order a 1000 count bottle, so she ordered from Chewy.  They didn't respond for about 5 days, then sent the first and only email approval to us at 5pm on a Saturday and then the email to our technician that they were unable to reach us after three attempts at about 7am the following morning.

Then the demands came from Chewy for either verbal approval (no paper trail, and no accountability for them), or fax (a paper trail but difficult to send/prove to client, so in most cases, still no accountability for them).  On one occasion we denied both and told them via phone to email three times over the span of an hour, admittedly with some rudeness on the third, and they proceeded to try to send a fax through our phone line consecutively for 35 minutes straight.  I was doing an emergency surgery on a dog with a wound with a bad bleeder from the linguofacial vein while this was happening.  Needless to say, it was hard to concentrate on saving the patient but we couldn't disconnect the phone line in case another urgent call needed to be answered.  The dog did fine (for anyone worrying about this) :).

All of the dishonesty with the timing of approvals have been worse recently.  I suspect related to difficulty with supply in the COVID-19 crisis.  It's been tough for us too, and we've been honest with clients about this.  So with Chewy, I suspect that instead of saying ""we're having shipping delays"" or ""we're on backorder for that very common thing"", they're simply claiming the vet isn't responding while they deal with delayed arrivals/shipments.

So now they've stopped doing emails altogether.  They can do fax or verbal approval (again, no accountability), or a new option.  They have an online platform called Petscriptions (again from what their own customer service implied, communication on the timing of prescriptions had no accountability for them, they can say whatever they want).  Furthermore, with yours and our data becoming a more valuable resource, I don't want to make the data mining that every online company does even easier for them.

I'm not writing this for the revenue.  You've all heard the ""shop local"" argument so many times I'd be beating a dead horse by saying it.  Money is tight, especially now.  And if you wanted to order online to save some money, I encourage you to do so.  I'm writing this because Chewy has peddled the idea that they genuinely *care* about your pets, through those occasional oil paintings from someone you and your dog have never met, to the kindhearted condolence texts that, when you read them with an objective eye, seem suspiciously formulaic, to the ""customer is always right"" level of pandering that you and I both know is harmful.  However, the stuff I described above is how they behave when dealing with a vital step in getting your pet the medication they need.  Given that this is one of those steps that you can't see, I think it's telling of how much they *actually* care about your pet.

It shouldn't need to be said that a corporation doesn't care about you or your fur-buddy, but here it is.  I only say this because there *are* people who care about your pet: you, your family, your neighbors (well, sometimes).   And yes, also your doggy daycare workers, your groomers, every worker at your vets office.  If we didn't care about your pet, we wouldn't have accepted far less money for the same work that human equivalents would make in all aspects.  So please, reserve your trust for the people who have actually tried to earn it, and don't let a group of people you've never met put a wedge between you.

Peace, love, wags, and purrs,

A pissed-off dogtor

tl;dr: Chewy is a dishonest trainwreck that doesn't care about you or your pet any more than the other corporate online pharmacies (perhaps even less).

EDIT: I'm sorry about not replying so long.  I work half days on Saturday and didn't feel right messing around on Reddit on shift.  A few things to add or discuss since I probably won't be able to reply to everything.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*FIRST AND FOREMOST\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*:  I got a message from a previous Chewy employee who will remain anonymous due to what you can see in the post:

>Hey there! I worked for said company mentioned earlier (signed a kind of NDA) and I want you to know that you're right. I worked in customer service for almost a year before moving up, and I have to say that the company is BS. There was no communication between locations, and the longer we went on, the more people straight up ignored any communication without getting reprimanded.  
>  
>I hated working with vets, although I'm studying to be one, and I felt like crap after getting off the phone. Sometimes there would be a case floating around for a week, and no one cared to look at the ""email only"" notes or ""please call after faxing""... It was embarrassing.  
>  
>I worked in the QA department for a while, but left after they refused to give me a raise, although I was the only person in the department with a degree and the knowledge of small animals,. exotics, and farm to keep the department going. No regrets. Terrible place for a person with an IQ over 35.  
>  
>Please don't share my name 😊

I really appreciated that and just want to say that if this user stuck through all that (including some angry vets and techs and receptionists which I can sometimes be myself) then they've got the kind of tough our profession needs now more than ever :)

SECOND:  Some people have brought up that their vet recommends Chewy or that their vet says they've never had a problem with them.  This may be true.  I do not know how the company works.  Perhaps its regional, perhaps its random.  But given that there is an employee here saying otherwise and numerous people in veterinary and human medicine confirming that this is a shared experience, I think it's safe to say that this is a widespread problem.  Furthermore, one should keep in mind that Chewy is owned by Petsmart, and Petsmart is in a partnership with Banfield.  I should also say that I don't know the status but I remember a previous attempt of a Banfield merger with Blue Pearl and VCA.  So the point here is that I wouldn't be surprised if some vets aren't allowed to bash Chewy or perhaps get financial incentive to send clients there specifically.   Or perhaps Chewy simply does better dealing with the clinics under their own umbrella.  Or it's nothing but coincidence, I'm a vet not a psychic.

THIRD: Yes, they have great customer service when speaking with you.  The point of this post is to discuss what happens to people who aren't the client and what happens to your prescriptions--that your pet needs--behind the scenes.

I'll edit more as needed or try to respond better to comments individually but there are a lot more than I anticipated o\_O

Basically, just be wary of any company where you'll never be able to chat with the boss (and also be wary of that boss if you can chat with them).  For example, I hear Jeff Bezos is building an actual giant clock that's totally not a doomsday device in the middle of his desert mountain.  Anyways, please be safe, keep 6 feet distance from any of those gross ""other people"", and stay fuzzy, soldiers.

Edit 2: I spelled bad :(

Edit 3: We've got another employee.  Thank you very much  PoodlePopXX

>As some one who worked for Chewy, they are an actual trash company. They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in.  
>  
>Just one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances. If you felt awful from the smoke inhalation and air quality you could choose to go home, but you’d have to take attendance points against your record. That’s the kind of company they are.  
>  
>I ordered from there often before I worked there. After I worked there I wouldn’t order from there if it was free.

,As someone who worked as a vet receptionist for 2.5 years I can say this is 100% true! There were days we fielded more calls from Chewy reps than clients looking for verbal approval on scripts they claim they had sent yet never did.

Our solution was to make Chewy resend the email or fax and never give verbal approval so we had a paper trail.

"[fluff] I adopted a dog yesterday after witnessing a horrific scene. Any advice?


I live in NYC, have a dark golden retriever named Bailey. He and I we’re taking a stroll when I heard a woman raising her voice and someone crying. It sounded like a kid. Bailey was getting a bit agitated, and as I looked into an alley I saw someone I can only describe as a mega-Karen, holding her dog by the collar (which looked like a prong collar) up into the air. Her dog was a German shepherd, and she kept yanking it up with both hands on the leash. As I watched, she pressed her crying dog to the ground and began to literally pound it on the head, then dragged it behind a dumpster where it began crying louder. It didn’t fight back once. Bailey started barking, and she ran off without the dog, cursing.

I ran over to investigate and I looked into the dumpster... the poor dog was wailing and foaming, trying to scramble out of what I can only describe as a pile of rotten shit. With the help of a couple strangers, I hoisted the dog out of there and it collapsed on the ground, crying. Bailey kept trying to get to her but I had someone hold him, and I called the police. I was redirected to the animal abuse line or something and they took it away to scan for a microchip and for the vet.

They found a microchip as well as the dog’s info (only 6 months old) and the woman was promptly arrested, as someone else saw what she was doing and videotaped the entire thing, including her throwing the dog into the dumpster.

I cannot to this day believe that there are people like that in this world. I am ashamed of that side of humanity and incredibly proud of those who choose to help. It makes me cry to this day that there are people who would do that to such an innocent animal.

Yesterday, I adopted the dog. I picked her up from the vet today. Her name is Dixie and she’s the biggest love bug. She was never trained, though, and she was severely abused and malnourished. She’s afraid of loud noises and leashes. There’s a lot of work to be done, but she and Bailey get along great.

,"I adopted a pitbull years ago who was similarly abused by an owner who wanted to use him for dog fighting.

I had that dog - his name was Zeus - for almost two years and Ive never known a kinder, more gentler soul. He changed me and heped me see the good in the world because he was so kind. But he developed epileptic seizures from the trauma of his earlier abuse. We did what we could but unfortunately they only got worse and affected his body and mind. We put him down and still feel so much pain from that. 

But I know that we did good by him by giving him a home to live in. Love and care. Good food. Belly rubs. Dixie will love you so earnestly because she is a dog and dogs love.

I'm out of dog food and don't get paid until next Thursday. I have a quarter pound of rice, four eggs, some zucchini noodles, and roughly half a chicken breast. My pup Cucamonga ran out of food last night and those are all of the foods I have that are good for dogs... I'm so embarrassed and I feel so badly for running out of food for him... I love him so much this is really causing me a lot of stress

My question is, can I combine all that stuff and just feed it to him until I get paid? 

My other question is, is that going to be enough for him? What else can I feed him to get him through? I called our local food bank, they don't have dog food, and I don't know if my vet has any for free but I dont even have enough gas to get there and back... we're on one income due to COVID otherwise I PROMISE my dog would never have run out of food.

"What's the worst advice you have received as a dog owner?
I'll go first. The worst advice I received many years ago was that a dog should never look you in the eyes. If they do it's an alpha behavior. 

Sadly, as a result of this lousy advice with my first dog I often was uneasy when the fella looked me in the eyes. I was worried he was going alpha on me and not listening to me. Side note, he was a bit hard to train ;).  

It was only until later that I learned this was how dogs show love for their owners, and you build a stronger bond.

"Our puppy was killed by the neighbors dog, could use some advice :/
To try to keep this as short as possible, my girlfriend and I dropped off our puppy that we've had for about 10 days at my grandparents so we could go out to the State Fair in Wisconsin. We didn't want to keep him locked up in the kennel, and my grandparents have a fenced in yard so we weren't worried. While we were gone the neighbors took their dog out and saw our puppy next door, they asked my grandma to pick him up so they could see/pet him. While grandma was holding him their dog jumped up and ripped him from my grandma's arms. They couldn't get him to the ER fast enough.

So I guess the question is, what's the best course of action? We spent 1200 on him, and $300 in vet bills and we only had him for 10 days. They were told they have to put the dog down within the month, and it has been labeled vicious by the cops. We plan on going over there this week to talk about being payed, but if they don't want to pay $1500 do we get a lawyer involved.

It's not a complicated case.   Document the cost of the dog and the vet bills.   Have your grandmother write out, in a paragraph or two, what happened.    Ask for the money.   If they refuse, go online, get the right forms, and file a small claims suit.   Prepare the documentation of loss, with any vet summaries, photos, etc., and make sure your grandmother attends the trial and is prepared to relate what she saw, and everything that happened after that.

,"So - this is not legal advice and I'm not your lawyer.

Generally, /u/GraceMDrake is correct - assuming the facts as you described them and you can get the testimony from your grandma, you have a decent shot at getting back the 1200 plus vet bills.  YMMV depending on state laws and no case is ever perfect.  In most states, dogs are chattel or rather personal property of sorts - I think a few more states have more progressive takes on that.  So, you usually can't recover more than those costs.  Be prepared with receipts for all items/services and ask for filing fees (state specific too).  

The question then becomes what you'd like to have occur to the other dog - I think you said they need to put the dog down by the end of the month.  Fortunately or unfortunately, and specific to state law, that's usually not a process which can be stopped.  At best, in most states, the alternative to maintaining a viscous dog usually means that it can't be let outside without various protections and can't be let into the yard (sometimes that means construction of a fully fenced (6 feet high plus roofing) cage/area for the dog to be).  YMMV - it's VERY state and sometimes municipality specific.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/p5ko25/our_puppy_was_killed_by_the_neighbors_dog_could/#h971adx,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I want a dog but need advice on getting over picking up poo
Dogs are so cool and would be a great addition to the family but I'm sure a lot of the care will come down to me. I didn't enjoy the diaper phase of the kids so looking for advice on adjusting my mindset on how to get over the reality of daily poo pickup.

UPDATE:
Thank you everyone!  Got a lot of really great advice from so many of you!  Was happy to hear how many of you had some of the same feelings initially but become a non-issue after a week or so of the routine.  Also learned that it's important to pay attention to the poop as a gauge of the dog's health.  And that dog poop is generally not as bad as human, but there's also much worse that comes out of a dog that a responsible owner should be prepared for.  There were a lot of great suggestions for different tools, but if the poop thing is really an issue than try walks with friend's dogs, or better yet help out at a shelter, until I get used to it and only then look into starting off with a small dog.

"Thinking of bringing the dog we just adopted back to the shelter and need advice
My partner and I adopted a 5 year old pit bull, American Staffordshire mix a couple of days ago. Her description at the shelter said she gets excited and loves giving kisses and snuggles. 
When we met her she did have a lot of energy but we were fine with that, she was excited and adorable! The worker at the shelter told us she knows how to sit and is very food motivated, and had her demonstrate how quick she is to sit. They also said that she was on trazodone (sedative) when they first took her in, which is normal for new shelter dogs, and she has been off it for a while. They also informed us that she was adopted by a family but was returned to the shelter after five days bc she ate one of the kid’s toys. 
Now it’s two days in and it has become clear that she is like a puppy in a strong, adult body. She has no training other than “sit” and being house trained, she is very mouthy when she plays, she is a little toy possessive and possessive of our bed which we’ve been trying to keep her off of. She lunged at me a little bit and growled. 
She is definitely a project dog and we feel a little bamboozled. Reading over the medical records they sent us home with it says she was so reactive a month into being at the shelter (12/30/21) that they had to prescribe the trazodone again to calm her. This was not mentioned to us at all. And it says the family had her for 9 days, not five. 
We have only had a GSD in the past and my partner had raised her from a puppy. We feel like we aren’t experienced enough nor do we have the ability to work with her through these issues. We are struggling to read her body language and feel a bit on edge when we’re trying to work with her. 
Genuine question: are we assholes for bringing her back to the shelter? I hate to think of her being back in a kennel, but I don’t believe she can thrive or live life to the fullest with us either. 
Coming to this conclusion has been very emotional and difficult for us, so I ask that you please be kind and understanding in your responses.

UPDATE: We spoke to our vet and she agreed that taking her back would be best for everyone involved   Her behaviors have escalated and we feel uneasy/anxious around her, which isn’t safe for us or the dog.

,"Unfortunately, I had to deal with a similar situation a few years back. We adopted an adult pit from a rescue who gave a perfect description for what we were looking for. We had numerous conversations with the main coordinator about him and really tried to make sure it would be a good fit. There seemed to be no red flags. It turned out to be a disaster. We have another dog in the home and they could not co-exist at all - which was something we were totally willing to work on (despite the rescue saying the dog was amazing with other dogs in the house). The dog was extremely destructive with any object it could grab, to the point where it couldn’t be on a leash because it would nip our hands to let go and rip it up. It was not crate trained, so that made options for him to be in the home pretty limited. And finally, there was a biting incident within a few days and growling/reactivity. NONE of these behavioral issues were even hinted at in all our convos. All they said was he occasionally got the zoomies while outside…other than that, he’s a “couch potato”. 

Completely agree with others that a rescue needs patience and resources to be successful in a new home. But there are also terrible stories of rescues just straight up lying to adopters about the dogs they are taking in. People should not be shamed if this happens to them and you need to make the best decision for all parties involved. 

We returned our dog within a few days. We told the rescue exactly what happened and they pretended to care and take it in mind for future adoption. Within a couple days, the dog was back on their website with the same description. It got adopted a few weeks later, and then returned again within a month. At that point the rescue finally did something about it. They provided extensive behavioral training, according to them, and thankfully changed the description dramatically.

,"All of my dogs but one have been adopted as rescues and one was raised from a puppy. Every single rescue dog needs significant direction, time and patience. There are very few dogs you can adopt from a kennel and have them nicely fit into your home life without a lot of work. If you don’t have the time to spend on a project dog I don’t suggest a rescue except in the case of long term foster dogs who have been living with a family and getting a lot of attention in a home. 

This is too much dog for you, you recognize that neither you or the dog are suitable for one another so there seems to be only one thing to do.

,"I would say returning it is a reasonable decision, particularly since it appears the shelter misrepresented the dog.

It should not be expected for a dog adopted through a rescue or shelter to have any sort of training. Behavioral issues are to be expected. However, this:

> she is a little toy possessive and possessive of our bed which we’ve been trying to keep her off of. She lunged at me a little bit and growled.

represents resource guarding behavior at best, and human aggression at worst. That should have absolutely been disclosed to you, particularly since resource guarding is not something that can ever be reliably trained out of a dog. If you do not feel safe (which, from your post, it seems you do not), I would return the dog to the shelter.

I will also caution you that the shelter may try to guilt trip you into keeping the dog, suggest alternate training, or that the behaviors may resolve itself once the dog settles in. The behaviors you described will not resolve themselves when the dog gets more comfortable (and are likely, in fact, to actually get worse). 

So, if you are sure you want to return him, make sure you have your reasons you listed here: they did not disclose very relevant behavioral issues that you are not equipped to deal with. They did not disclose the fact at least one of these behaviors was so severe it had to be managed with medication. The growling and lunging directed towards people make you uncomfortable. And that you would not have adopted the dog if they had made these clear.

We had a similar experience with the first dog we tried to adopt, where the rescue did not disclose his severe resource guarding and aggression (including biting my hand hard enough to draw blood when I moved within a few feet of a toy, and lunging at/snapping at my wife's face), and outright lied about him being cat-friendly (we have four cats). The rescue tried to guilt trip us *hard* into keeping the dog and made it very emotionally difficult, even though we knew they were in the wrong and that not keeping him was the right choice.

I hope this doesn't put you off dog ownership permanently, and that everything goes smoothly for you.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/s8guch/thinking_of_bringing_the_dog_we_just_adopted_back/#hti58ci,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You're not assholes, and I despise shelters that do this.

You have a big, strong dog that can hurt you and is already exhibiting signs of possessiveness and potential aggression. The dog probably needs more work than it sounds like you're willing to put in - and that's fine. It's not what you signed up for, and the difference between getting through to this dog and not could mean you get hurt or somebody else gets hurt.

Huge red flag that they had to drug the dog to get her adopted, and I'm guessing (you probably are too) that she did more than destroy a toy.  There are a ton of dogs out there - get one you feel safe with. There are behavioral problems that can be tolerated and worked with - there are some that can and should be deal breakers for most people, especially people who aren't professional trainers.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/s8guch/thinking_of_bringing_the_dog_we_just_adopted_back/#hthaicl,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[Discussion] Have you ever had to rehome your dog? Banjo is going to live in Wyoming to learn to herd cattle, and we aren't going with him. Looking for advice.
[Here's a pic](https://imgur.com/a/0hzlbg7)

He's leaving tomorrow. We found an awesome family that uses heelers to move cattle across the Wyoming/Idaho border, and they loved the potential they saw in him.

Banjo is a little over 2, and he has always show extremely strong herding tendencies since he was a pup. I started training him to run agility courses, teaching him commands with a shepherd's whistle, but living in the city in Utah there wasn't ever enough for him to do, and we know how happy he would be living the cowboy lifestyle.

My wife and I are heartbroken. We know it's for the best, we know that he will eventually be more happy herding cattle than he could ever be jumping over PVC pipe in our backyard, but it doesn't make it any easier. Chances are we won't ever see him again. Has anybody else ever had to rehome a dog? Do they understand what is happening? I hope he knows that we love him very much, and I hope he isn't confused or scared when the lady comes to get him in the morning.

Anyway, just needed to share this and get this off my chest. Banjo is a good boy. He's going to make a great working dog.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ic6rcu/discussion_have_you_ever_had_to_rehome_your_dog/,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was also an escape artist and constantly getting in trouble for chewing things because she just always wanted to be doing something. She was great off leash and had great potential has a hunting dog. My dad found a guy with some land that was looking for a black lab to train as a bird dog. He came to pick her up and she ran up to him like she had known him forever and jumped in the passenger seat of his truck. She was amazing but needed more than I could give her.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ic6rcu/discussion_have_you_ever_had_to_rehome_your_dog/#g212qst,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"My GSD/lab mix was rehomed to me because he was too boisterous and energetic. His prior owners felt horrible but recognized that part of his problem was that they couldn’t give him the exercise, attention, and training he needed. They had another large, energetic dog that they had no problems with so they rightly thought they could handle him when they got him as a puppy. But my pup was just far worse than even a knowledgeable dog person would expect. As I sit here, six years later and with him curled up on my bed with me, I’m forever grateful that they decided to find him a better home. He was bummed out for three days after the rehoming but is without a doubt very much ‘my dog’ now. He fell into his new routine quick enough and had no trouble bonding with me or the other people and animals in the house. I’m sure your dog is going to be very happy once he gets into his work. It sounds like his drive is super high and he’s going to get a home that truly lets him work as he likes to.


In an ideal world we’d all get our dogs and keep them for their whole lives. But every dog is an individual and sometimes their personalities or energy levels are more than you can reasonably anticipate. It sounds like you put a lot of work into trying to meet his needs and he still needed more. I think it’s very brave of owners to rehome their dogs in those circumstances. You’re putting the dogs needs above your emotions and that’s a difficult thing to do.


I think the only shame would be if you failed to use this as a learning experience. Herding dogs are energetic, smart dogs that crave a lot of stimulation. It sounds like you got one on the upper end of the spectrum. Now that you know they can reach that level, I would go for a calmer breed if you decide to adopt again. Or find a high energy dog that’s already full-grown so that you can more accurately assess their needs before the adoption.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ic6rcu/discussion_have_you_ever_had_to_rehome_your_dog/#g20z6jx,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I'm on the opposite side - I adopted my dog from the humane society shortly after he turned 4. From what they could tell me, he was with an elderly couple, the wife passed, the husband was moving into a home and no family wanted/could take him. 

He bonded with us immediately - he plopped down on my lap on the car ride home, and jumped right into our bed and made himself at home as soon as we walked in our door. He was definitely a bit confused and had some separation anxiety, but we worked through it.

We were also told via questionnaires filled out by his old owners that he was super low key and enjoyed just hanging out - this dog has SO much energy and still acts like a puppy 5 years later at 9 years old. He'll run with me, crushes long hikes with us, and loves long walks. I honestly think he's a lot happier in a higher energy home. I have no doubt that he loved his old owners, but I'm glad we can offer him a bit more!",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ic6rcu/discussion_have_you_ever_had_to_rehome_your_dog/#g2169pz,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Yes. I unfortunately had to rehome one of my dogs about 3 years ago. I cried for weeks. I still miss her. 

She was dog reactive and I lived in a townhome complex. I worked with her with a trainer and made sure to always walk her on a leash, under control. We had one too many run ins with neighbor dogs that were not on a leash. I didn’t know what to do but it wasn’t fair to her to keep her cooped up in my townhome and it wasn’t fair to my neighbors who were afraid of her. 

Luckily she is the most human friendly dog on the planet. She went to live as an only dog with a young family desperate for a dog. She now has a huge yard and three kids to play with.

,"We gave up our little shih tzu to a lady who found her after she got out of our yard. They fell absolutely in love with each other, and we had three other dogs at home, all of whom were special needs. She got short shrift on attention a lot. Little Miki had had a wonderful time overnight with this lovely lady, going to granddaughter's ballet class and being made much of. We couldn't take her away from that, so asked the woman if she'd consider adopting her. She was stunned: ""You'd give her up??"" Yes, we did, but only to someone who could give her a better life than we could. Miki has since been traveling all over the country, is the official mascot for the dance class, and has a jeweled purple collar. She's the princess she should always have been.

There are times when you do what is best for the dog. Think of it as you're not giving him up because you don't want him; you are giving him up to the best possible life. And chances are he will miss you, a lot at first, but he will love his new home too, and will settle in.

,"We rehomed a dog when I was 11. 
In hindsight we should have never had a dog then. That summer we moved to a bigger and detached house and my dad finally convinced my mum for us to have a dog.
After that summer suddenly my parents got divorced. My dad had a new girlfriend.
Of course my sister and I were inconsolable and asked my mum “but we’re still getting a dog right?”

She shouldn’t have said yes but she did. We soon found people that had a litter of mixed dogs. Dutch Patridge dog with something else. So spaniel type hunting dog.

She was a great dog but she had terrible separation anxiety. Probably because we didn’t train it correctly. My mum didn’t know any better (grew up on a farm) and us being kids...
My mum worked full time and we were in school. I’d go home 3 times a day during break to let her out. But that wasn’t enough. She needed people that were home more. 
So eventually after a year or so my mum found a family with a stay at home mum and dog experienced. 

I still feel guilty that we failed this dog by having her in the first place but for her it was the best thing to be rehomed.

"[Help] I saw a german shepherd kill a chihuahua at the dog park last week. Need advice moving forward.
So this is a super weird post and I'm sorry if it goes against the rules of this sub. If it does I'll remove it. I kind of need advice for getting over this experience I had. I feel truamatized and don't know if I'll ever be able to take my pups to the dog park again and it makes me feel bad. I'm also starting to feel a bit of breed discrimination coming on and I don't like that either, as I've always loved dogs of all kind.


Basically I just moved to a new neighborhood and have only been to the local dog park maybe 3 or 4 times. The third time I went a woman was there with a large german shepherd that was absolutely out of control. It didn't listen when she called it, it ran, bullied other dogs, and eventually attacked my dog (a small black lab) when she tried to pick up a ball and hurt her nose. It was pretty brutal but with another owner I was able to separate them before any real damage was done. It sucked, but I understand it happens when you take a bunch of dogs to the dog park and that's just part of being a dog owner.

That was about a month ago. Cut to last week, me and my fiance took our dogs to the same park. There were a ton of dogs there, including two different german shepherds than the one that had previous attacked my dog. I didn't think anything of it since the owner seemed really on top of them, and the dogs themselves were sweethearts and seemed to get along with everyone. A woman then came into the dog park with a chihuahua, and as most people are aware, when a new dog comes to the dog park dogs start running up to it to say hello. Out of no where one of the shepherds that had been so sweet and loving the whole time runs up and just flips this poor little dog on its back, picks it up in its mouth and runs away. I'll spare you all the details of what happened next, but basically the chihuahua was pretty much killed in front of all of us, including it's owner. It was...one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.

I just don't know what to do from here. I don't know if I can ever take my dogs to a dog park again. To have back to back bad experiences with the last one leaving me traumatized I don't know how to ever feel safe going to a dog park again. Also I find myself hating german shepherds and wanting to stay away from them which sucks cause I absolutely love dogs and never have ever felt resentment towards a specific breed.

Has anyone else ever experienced anything similar and are there ways to try and move past this? Should I just never go to the dog park again and try and move on or should I just avoid dog parks for the rest of my life?

Sorry if this seems like a rant. I just feel really awful right now about everything.

edit: I'm amazed at all these great responses in such a short time. I'm at work so I'm trying to get to answering everyone but it's tough. To clear up some confusion: there were indeed two areas of this dog park. One for small dogs and one for big. The chihuahua owner deliberately brought her dog into the big dog park thinking it would be okay. I understand she was at fault for this, but since I've only ever had labs with basically zero aggression/prey instinct I wasn't sure if the GSD was just wild and snapped or if this was something that was to be expected.

As for your new issue with GSD, if this is the worst thing that you have ever seen in your life, it makes sense that you are projecting your emotions onto the most understandable aspect. That would be a very iconic breed of dog. But it is no different than being scared and twitchy to drive after a crash. You heal. You move on. You can pour anger and resentment into the breed forever. You don't have to get a GSD. But that doesn't really deal with the issue and that is you dealing with seeing something like that.

 She lived, but she was extremely lucky. Even the vet said she was lucky. That'll help with any nervousness that you have, going to a dog park when you are nervous can cause your own pups to on the defensive. The next thing is when your pups get along really well with another person's, talk to their owner. Then you guys can start to coordinate times to meet up, and continue to do this until you have a good group. Obviously people who you don't know or trust will still be able to bring their own dog, but you'll have more people around you that may be able to help if anything gets out of hand.

"Need Advice: The dogs are running our life and I see no escape
So I must start by saying that this has become an emotionally overwhelming and complex issue. When I met my now husband he was living alone with his little dog. His home was tidy but smelled awful of dog pee and there were dried turds we found in the basement when we moved. His little dog is a chihuahua dachshund mix and was morbidly obese. It seemed he was loved but struggling in the behavior department and his owner was not taking the best care of him. He would leave him home alone all day which I assumed was the cause for going to the bathroom in the house because when you would let him out into the fenced yard he would do his business immediately and come in for his treat. Little guy was very fat, barked incessantly at the dog, would get the zoomies for half an hour straight when you came into the house but knew basic commands and once he calmed down would just go take a nap or chew a bone peacefully. When DH moved into my home I did not own a dog but did all I knew how to help the little dude. He went to the vet for overdue care, was put on a new food and spent a lot more time outside running and getting exercise. 

We found that he was not going potty in the house because he wasn’t well trained but because he liked to mark. I would take him out for a long walk and he would do his business and mark outside quite a bit. Then right after coming in, I would catch him squeezing what he could out right onto my couch. He is crate trained and loves to chill in his crate so I found that he could just not be trusted to be left unsupervised and used the crate intermittently to ensure he would do as little marking as possible. I am not a fan of filth and have a daughter that I prefer to keep a clean home for. He would find opportunities like when my back was turned in the kitchen to go mark. Very frustrating because I wanted him to feel like part of the family and not be locked up all the time. 

Little guy has an extremely loud and aggressive bark, he reacts to any sound at the door as well as imperceivable triggers. He has multiple barking episodes an hour and it takes a long time to calm him. This issue has only gotten worse over the years. He will also whine and cry out/bark in his crate for hours. You will let him out and give water and let him go to the bathroom, but all he cares about is checking to see if there’s anything on the kitchen floor and then he’s off to sniff the couch (we’ve had quite a few couches be replaced since he moved in) and lift his leg. So it’s back in the crate. He makes all this noise not just when people are in the room moving around but through the night and when no one is home. I’m not able to relax for even a second. 

Although he loves to spend time with me and my daughter he has bit us both multiple times in our hands and face. He will do it when we help unwrap his lead outside from around a chair leg, he will be giving kisses and suddenly bite, he will happily run in his crate when we go to leave, gently take a treat from your fingers then snap at you as you close the crate. Generally unpredictably with the exception of when he is resource guarding. He used to be allowed out at times when people were eating but just telling him to back off he would get aggressive. 

We now have a very sweet bulldog who is 2.5. We got her as a puppy and up until 6 month’s ago, her and little guy were besties. He began snapping at her, biting her to resource guard and just doing all he could to maintain dominance over the situation. The problem is that he is 13lbs and she is 57lbs. So one day it became an altercation. She was not going to tolerate being attacked for wanting to be in the same room as him and the people he wanted to hang out with. She tackled him to the ground and pinned him. She did not hurt him, or try to bite but he screamed bloody murder and was doing all he could to bite her. I reached in to pull them apart and got bit to the point of needing medical care as the meat of my palm was ripped open quite deeply.  The dogs have not been able to be in the same room together since. They remain crated and switched out through the day. 

After a couple of years he is at a very healthy weight and maintaining it. He has routine vet care and we’ve asked if he is in any pain as he is now an older dog. He is perfectly healthy and his issues seem to be completely behavioral. After the big fight, we discussed the issues with our vet and she suggested he be put down. We opted to try Prozac which he has been on for 4 months now. We’ve seen no difference. We’ve also contacted three different trainers who said they felt they would be unable to help due to his age. DH down plays the severity of the issues, points out everything the other dog does wrong, ignores and avoids the amount of daily effort and the stress it causes me throughout each day. He absolutely will not hear of rehousing the dog and it would break my heart to have him put down even if this is what the vet suggested.I am now 7 months pregnant and the stress of dealing with this dog is really putting me over the edge. I am not looking forward to him waking the baby up and later having to navigate keeping him away from the baby for fear of biting, as well as not allowing him near baby’s things as he may try to pee on them. 

Out of stubbornness of my husband I am left to handle full time work, carrying and later caring for the little one, maintaining the home and dealing with the constant chaos that is coordinating/mitigating dog issues. I am feeling trapped and struggling with rage toward the damn covered crate in my living room.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/vry7ci/need_advice_the_dogs_are_running_our_life_and_i/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I don't wanna be the bearer of bad news but this doesn't sound like an issue with your dogs. This is very clearly an issue with your husband. You describe him as a negligent dog owner when you met him; an obese dog, dried feces and piss on the floor. It sounds like your husband has not improved much since you met him (which is of course, not on you, but on him!!), but instead is happy to let you do all the cleaning that he simply... didn't do before. This isn't an issue of him meeting you where you're at, the issue is that your standards for hygiene are likely incompatible. 

I think what you guys need are a few couples therapy sessions, so he can maybe start to see that this is not an acceptable way to live, since he clearly doesn't get the message from you. Honestly it sounds like he might need some therapy to help him manage whatever mental health issue enables him to live in filth like you describe. I don't blame you for being upset. The warning signs were there when you moved in that he would not be helpful when it comes to issues of hygiene, and I'm sure it still feels really shitty that he isn't changing. But this might also just be the way he is, and you may have to accept that as a price of admission.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/vry7ci/need_advice_the_dogs_are_running_our_life_and_i/#ieyg7ev,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I'm sorry but you are pregnant and this is more of  a husband problem than a dog problem. Your husband needs to get on board with you because this situation is stressful for you, the unborn child, and that dog. I would absolutely rehome or build a little dog outside for it. I don't even like the thought of that but this dog cannot be trusted and you will have a newborn child in that home and that's going to be a nightmare.

Your husband refuses to listen or compromise and it's like his feelings are the only things that matter. I'm sorry but he needs to make a decision that takes all his family into consideration not just him and his needs. I'd suggest not  letting your husband's ""stubborness"" have you working 150% while  he does the minimum. Either he gets on board or the dog goes not more YOU mitigating the issues of his unruly dog. YOU need to be more stubborn or he and the dog can go back to his piss-smelling house and you stay in your home. You need to remind yourself that your standards don't need to be trampled so he can be comfortable. No adult wants to live in a home that smells like dog piss. That's just disgusting. No children deserve to have an unruly dog mucking up the place.

Personally? If my lumpen life partner can’t stir himself enough to deal with a dog he let shit in the house and get morbidly obese, leaving it all up to me, I’d put down a dog that bit me or my child *more than once*.

"Please help! I need advice on how to deal with family members who say “why waste so much money when it’s just a dog,”
My 11 year old Dachshund/Jack Russel mix- Banjo- has recently been diagnosed with skin cancer. He is booked in on Thursday to have three lumps removed from his ear, chest, and belly. I am really stressed as he has had a lump removed on his ear two years ago and it came back from pathology as malignant. 


Although my partner and I will be covering the costs of the operation - which are going to be quite high- my family has been saying very hurtful things about it. “Why waste all that money a dog”. “Vets are scam artists who push bills up.” “It’s just a dog.” “Just let him die the natural way.” 

I find these comments very hurtful and insensitive to the point where I had to cut a lunch short today. 

I have tried to explain to them that this dog is like a child to me who has been with me through my worst times (when I was depressed and suicidal) but they just laugh at this. 

I know that some of my family members are struggling with money (mostly due to their own bad financial planning) and I always try and help them where I can, but they are making me out to be very selfish, and are implying that I should just give the money to them instead. 

Has anyone dealt with anything similar? 
I am really upset about this whole thing as well as stressed for Banjo and his op.

Update: Banjo is out of surgery and it was successful. He is recovering well. Thank you to everyone for their kind words and good wishes towards him and I. I really appreciate them and they have helped me get through these last few days.

Only bleeding heart Liberals care about animals so much.” and so on.

What I’ve started to say is variations of the following. “Oh? Good thing it’s my money and not yours.” “Yeah, people like you shouldn’t be allowed to own a pet.” “I wonder if your kids will say the same thing about you when you need to be hospitalized for something?” “You’re just a person. Why should I care about what happens to you?” “Why would you waste time going to the doctor? You’re not even that sick, just suck it up and get over it.” “Well you’re a terrible person who should keep their nasty opinions to themselves.”

Honestly? Don’t waste your time trying to explain anything to people like this. Shoot insults right back at them because that’s the only thing that’s going to get through to them and even so they’re *still* going to make those comments, so you may as well get some satisfaction out of it.

And stop giving your family money. The next time they ask for a handout, kindly remind them that they’ve told you several times you’re wasting your money on your pets, so tell them that you’re taking their advice and aren’t going to give your money up for useless things like that anymore and only spend money where it counts; which is your pets and not them.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/s1dz5c/please_help_i_need_advice_on_how_to_deal_with/#hs7kf06,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Fleeing domestic violence situation, need advice for dog on plane
hi, throwaway account, i'm leaving a domestic violence situation in a week and a half and i need advice for flying with my dog. i've only got a small window of opportunity here and i've got some questions that i need help with.

i have a dog, he's too big for the cabin, so i'll be flying him down below. cost isn't a problem, i've been siphoning money for it, but my dog is pretty anxious and he's absolutely never done something like this before. i've never flown before too, sorry if these are silly questions, i tried to find out all i could but most of them were on having the dog in the cabin.

he won't cry the whole time, he just panics when i leave, would they not let him fly because he'll cry when i'm handing him off to the service professionals? he'll calm down, i know he will, but not until i leave his sight. i can't buy the crate early or the man i'm with would figure out i'm trying to leave his house, so i'll probably only get a week to work with an ordered one while he's on a fishing trip. what's the best crate training to squeeze into a week? what're little tips and tricks that're good for flying? it's a five hour flight, i'll make sure he goes to the bathroom beforehand. what happens if they won't let him fly because he becomes anxious? would i find out when i touch down?

i'm sorry, i can't drive, otherwise i  would, i know it isn't safe taking them on planes like this, i don't have any other options and we live on base, everybody knows him so i can't pay anybody to drive me or help me out with this. i can't leave my dog behind, he's all i have, thank you

\[edit: i can't respond to everybody, i've been busy fixing everything, but i wanted to thank you all so much for your help and support. i don't have anybody here, they're all his friends and i've been anxious about this for the last few days but this has made me feel so much better. ordering him a thunder shirt, walking my dog to the vet, it's about an hour but it's worth it, getting the health certification, talking with them exactly about what my dog can have beyond sedations, have him eat his meals out of the crate for the week before, and I want you all to know that I just put in the reservation and i took my first long breath in a long time. i'll do an update later and break it down step by step wwhen i'm safe, hopefully this can help someone else\]

\[further update: i can't leave, a medical emergency came up and my safety plans dissolved. I hope all this information helps out someelse. thank you anyway.\]",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/109x9lf/fleeing_domestic_violence_situation_need_advice/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"hi i’m not sure if i’ll be much help, but i can offer my insight for a few things. 

i used to work at a dog boarding facility and we would hold dogs before flights. most airlines that fly dogs will offer hire crates for the flight, so you won’t need to have a physical crate with you at any time, just at the airport or MAYBE a few days before. 

if it’s possible, a vet visit may be the best option for some sort of medication for him to take before the flight. i’m not entirely sure what they will offer, but there are light sedations available. 

if he’s only worried as you’re walking away, i’m sure they’ll still allow him on the flight, but i would call to ask a few people at the airline just to make sure if it’s something you’ll worry about. if you cant call, it’s totally fine, i am certain he will be allowed on. it’s more the big problem dogs that don’t calm down at all and are a safety risk to themselves and others that aren’t allowed on.

as for crate training, you don’t HAVE to do it if it’s unsafe or may slim your chances of getting out in any way. it’s helpful if you can, but it’s not a must. using a cardboard box, small room or other makeshift crate will be fine if you can’t get a proper one. he will be fine for a few hours. try your best not to feel bad for your pup, you are saving him and yourself from a dangerous situation. he will be much much much better off after this flight and if he could talk, i’m sure he’d tell you how thankful he is for this.

as for other tips to calm him down, i would suggest letting him take something with your smell like an unwashed shirt or pillow case, his favourite toy, something like a thunder shirt which is a shirt that applies gentle pressure for the dog to help levitate their anxiety or a pheromone collar. NONE of this is necessary if it is too risky for you to do so. 

as for yourself, airports are big, but easy to navigate and there are plenty of people to ask if you’re in need of directions or any other help. get there at least an hour early so you don’t miss the flight & only pack what you absolutely need, even if it’s just yourself. if you have people to talk to, get someone to come with you or at least to keep tabs while you are getting out so that someone knows you made it, IF it’s safe to do so. 

and, if plans change and it’s too risky to take your dog with you, leave him. your safety comes first. i know how heartbreaking it is but he will understand.

i hope some of this helps. if you have any other questions please don’t hesitate to ask!!!",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/109x9lf/fleeing_domestic_violence_situation_need_advice/#j40voeu,,,,,,,,,,,,

"[Help] Seeking advice from anyone that had rehabilitated an alcoholic dog.
I need advice from anyone that's treated a dog that has developed a substance abuse disorder, specifcally (in this case) alcohol.

I was visiting some distant relatives and went around to their neighbours place. These guys are both fuckwits and animal hoarders. One of their dogs 'ticks' was that it could drink a half bottle of wine (350mls, \~12.5US fluid ounces, of 11% alc/vol). They wouldn't feed him until he completed this 'trick', which he must do twice a day, and is repeated everyday. They think it's a great laugh... I think it's cruel as fuck. They are getting sick of him though because now he no longer staggers around after consuming the alcohol and said that they are think about getting rid of him (which means a bullet in these parts). I offered to take him, and they accepted.

Problem is, the dog seems to go absolutely berserk, and then looks in pain, before staggering around in fright if I don't give him a small glass (100mls) of wine. Before I realised this, I opened a bottle of wine myself and took a swig, and he leapt up on me desperately licking my lips and sticking his tongue in my mouth... I didn't know if it was a physiological or psychological dependence.

I've taken him to my vet (whom estimated his age at 6 years old), who has said this is a rather unusual situation and alcoholism treatment hasn't been studied widely in dogs, but this dog is likely physically dependent on alcohol and he's going through the ""DT's"" just like human  alcoholics do when they are cut off from alcohol 'cold turkey'.

My vet said he couldn't professionally recommend I keep giving the dog alcohol, nor could he think of a specialist that could help. Off the record he suggested that I wean the dog down, 50mls a week until his consumption is at 100mls a day, then down by 10mls a day, until 10mls. At 10mls to reduce it 1 ml a day every 2-3 days. He also 'off the record' suggested to be flexible, to put up with 'whining' for more, but if he shows withdrawal symptoms to give a little more if it helps, but to be careful not to teach the dog the 'trick' of acting in withdrawal just to get more wine.

I really want to help this guy, as he is amazingly sweet. I find it sickening that whenever my hands go above roughly my shoulder height he covers (I'm thinking he's been hit a lot maybe?) and he freaks out at the sight of a rolled up newspaper... poor boy.

I know it's a long shot, but what do you recommend? The vet said that he would consider giving valium as that may ease withdrawals, but as that isn't safe to mix with alcohol I have to decide whether I'm going to give him valium and promise no alcohol, or just wean him down on alcohol slowly.

I already own a boxer (probably not pure though), and as this guy seems to be a red-heeler crossed with a boxer, he and my other dog are getting on like a house on fire! It's so great to watch them both play and be so happy! That is, until my poor new boy needs another drink and becomes so anxious and pained :-/

Any advice? I feel quite unsure of what the best way to rehab him is, and am worried that general veterinary principles (i.e. ""never give your dog alcohol) might interfere with whats best in this extremely nuanced situation. I feel like it's so unfair this guy is suffering because of being made to do 'party tricks' when he is so affectionate, and somehow even still has a spark in his eye and hasn't just shut off to the world despite how cruel the hand he was dealt has been...

EDIT: I've added some pics

(Removed for fear of doxxing, given I got an abusive/treatening call from relatives, it seems the police have acted!)

EDIT 2: I have called the police. Despite the fact they aren't proactive, I had taken photos of an active amateur meth lab and firearms that were neither being stored correctly, and likely not owned by someone with relevant paperwork. THIS may be investigated, remembering it's a 'fly-in fly-out' community, or a \~40 hour return trip from nearest police OUTPOST, and longer from proper police station. The settlement may have already had a visit from the police, or if they haven't they may have soon. Hopefully it's the proper police and not the 'tribal justice' administration that has no real power OR interest in these sorts of things. One of the people involved in 'training' the dog to do the trick is a retired member.

UPDATE:

Have spoken to my vet friend, who has discussed it with another vet. They have decided that despite the law, given the unique circumstances, the are confident despite statute that an alcoholic wean wouldn't be considered abuse. I am going to wean him down at a rate slightly quicker than the one originally suggested (in the post), but be monitoring him constantly for signs that he is in withdrawal, in which case I'll let him have a small amount and re-assess in 45 minutes. I also have some IM Valium that I'm to give him if he has a seizure, before immediately transporting him to the hospital. The vet will look him over twice a week at his clinic, monitoring his weight and have another liver test done in a few weeks!

It seems police have acted, as I received a call from one of said relatives (whom live nextdoor) shouting about police being there etc. and hanging up. I blocked their number.Thank you all for you kind comments and advice. I will update you guys in a couple of weeks to let you know how it's going!  


EDIT TO ADD TO UPDATE: He's been switched to cheap cider, from wine, which he wasn't sure of at first, but after he realised it was alcoholic (about after 15 minutes I'd coaxed him to have some when he was starting to get agitated and restless) he then wanted more. Makes me really think it's not a 'taste' thing at all, he just has become so dependent he needs the alcohol in him to feel 'normal'... poor guy.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/916n20/help_seeking_advice_from_anyone_that_had/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You could try r/AskVet. Make sure you fill out the requested information and ask a clear question.

I'd consider the possibility that it's a behavioral issue rather than a physical dependence, though, and my inclination would be not to feed any wine or open any wine in the dog's presence. I know your relatives claimed that they'd been giving the dog a bottle of wine a day, every day, but I strongly suspect that they were exaggerating.

,"Seems to me that weaning him off the booze would be better for him than doping him til it's over. I mean his mental state is as fucked as his physical. To him, he feels like shit which is scary enough since he doesn't feel safe with humans and when he barfs or something he's afraid he's ""been bad"" and will get punished. My theory is that doping him and having him feel handicapped on top of it will just be straight up terrifying. If it were me, I'd wean the alcohol and then support him through the withdrawal. I'd just do my best to show him he could count on me for kindness. I'd also be hyper vigilant of how much water he's drinking (hopefully lots) and letting him sleep as much as he wants.

Best of luck to ya OP, you're a hero for taking this dog. Please call the authorities on those people. They'll just do this to another and another etc.

Edit: Saw that OP has already called the cops - they sound like real winners. May I suggest contacting rescue groups in the state or nearby states if you're on a boarder. Sometimes groups like that are big enough to make a big enough stink for the powers that be to act just to save face. In my state the various groups have often gotten together to FB blast the cops or hoarders for inaction.

"Wife is anxious and not herself every since getting a dog 2 weeks ago and now wants to rehome him. Need advice.
Hello, so me and my wife recently adopted a 1 year old German Shepard and today she started crying and says she wants to give him back / rehome him because she has gotten such bad anxiety every since we got him. I love him so much already and it breaks my heart because I love my wife and our dog and I know our dog is happy with us and loves us very much but my wife is constantly worried about our dog and this has lead to her feeling anxious and not able to live her life. The dog is really well behaved and smart the only thing he does is bark sometimes at night which we are trying to work on. I know she loves him also because she is always excited to see him after work but the biggest struggle she is having is just constantly worrying about him / checking cameras while she’s not at home, and I try telling her she doesn’t need to worry so much. This is also her first time having a dog. I know for certain he is having a better life with us then his prior home which also makes me sad. 

Does anyone have any advice? How can she stop worrying so much? I have to honour my wife’s wishes as I love her and will put her first over the dog but it will break my heart if I have to give our dog back or rehome him as me and him have developed a very strong bond already.

It seems odd that if she is worried about him, that she would give him back and never know if he is in a good place or not so that is another thing to think about.   


Dogs can be stressful and unfortunately that is what you sign up for when you get one. We have three, but more recently it was four. The fourth one we lost to a very aggressive form of cancer that came out of nowhere. But you get comfort in the fact that they had a wonderful life up until it was there time, and once you have healed from one you can give a wonderful life to the next one.   


Having a dog is amazing and hard all at the same time, but I wouldn't let the worry get to you and cause you both to miss out. I would really focus on what the concern is and then modify your home, routine, or lifestyle to ensure that the concern is erased.

,"Puppy blues are no joke. I cried every day for the first two weeks we had our dog. (At least!) My only other dog was from childhood, so it was a lot to take in. 

I never wanted to give her back, but was not ready for the emotions that come from suddenly having a living being depend on me. It was during covid lockdowns, and working remotely (teaching) meant I was often the only one with our dog _24 hours a day_ since my partner was an essential worker. It was overwhelming, no matter how much I loved our dog. It also didn't help that we have a reactive pup, and my partner and I had different ideas on training, play, and so on. 

Please continue to let your wife feel her feelings and reassure her that her anxiety is real. Encourage her to seek supportive resources. Maybe take on the vast majority of care for your dog for now. (Just temporarily!) It sounds like she's terrified of not caring properly for the dog, and that might take pressure off. But most importantly, give it time.

We've (my parents and I) gotten our first ever dog back in March. She was a 1,5 y.o Labradoodle adopted from a family. I love her to death and in the beginning,I was so incredibly anxious (did she eat something bad, OMG what if she dies (after eating a dead frog from the street (she is a hell of a lot faster than I am), what if I'm a terrible owner and we should give her back etc) I would get physically ill and didn't want to leave the room because I was afraid she would drop dead or run away or hate me if I returned. 

My therapist told me my anxiety is all due to me loving her so much and my brain's realisation that she is actually ours is taking my mind a while to create extra ""organizer filles"" in my brain to store in all the new experiences and emotions. 

Okay, hope this helps!! tell her it will get better, you will get into a routine with your dog and he is so young so you can still teach him so much! If it helps you can try crate training him during the nights so you know he is safe and in one spot (that is what helps me).

"Rehoming dog, feel awful. Advice from others who have done the same.
Hi all,

Really sorry to be writing this but need to get this off of my chest. 

We got a terrier breed puppy last august and he’s just turned one. We have an older female dog - bichon (12 now 13) who has gotten on well with other dogs in the past and perhaps naively, we expected that things would be okay. 

We have been to the vets to rule out any medical issues and the vet mentioned he felt as though our young dog was emotionally immature for his age and didn’t recommend neutering him for a good while. 

90% of the time, the dogs are fine - not close by any means but tolerate each other. About 6 months ago, I had to break up a fight between them where my younger dog went for the older one - this was over food that fell on the floor which I could understand. We made a very conscious effort after this point to train away food aggression and resource guarding and sought help from a behaviourist however this has now started occurring over what our younger dog perceives as his territory - he has gone for the older dog once a week roughly since drawing blood on a couple of occasions. Tonight he went for her when she attempted to leave the room and hurt her paw - she was over it very quickly but it was horrible to see. 

My older dog is miserable and terrified of him and she just seems very unhappy - her tail is constantly down around him and won’t move from her bed if he’s in the room. It’s made our lives so tough and we are constantly on edge in case he goes for her again (and I’m sure the dogs pick up on the stress we feel.) 

As a family, we can’t eat meals at the same time because of the anxiety over food aggression etc and it’s not feasible to separate the dogs all of the time - especially as both are very human focused and affectionate with people. 

We’ve made the decision to rehome him and the woman found through our breeder sounds like the perfect fit. She’s aware of the history and is a dog trainer and vet nurse with a huge garden. We’ve booked in a visit for her to meet him and we’ll take it from there. 

I absolutely know it’s the right decision for both of the dogs but I just feel so guilty and like I’ve failed at giving him a home for life. He is the sweetest little guy 99% of the time but we just can’t have our older dog so unhappy. However there is so much anxiety about it - what if this new woman rehomes him etc. 

Please let me know if you’ve had any positive experiences after a similar outcome because I need to hear those now.

EDIT: a few comments have mentioned things which I believe are location specific. I’m based in the UK. 

this has received far more attention and comments than I ever thought and I would love to be able to respond a thank you to all of your incredible comments. Thank you for sharing your stories, both from the perspective of rehoming yourselves and being the person to rehome.

When I was a kid, 12 years old, my mom had a dog, a shiba inu that she absolutely adored. Of course the whole family loved him but he and my mom had a special connection. Problem was that the dog was territorial and aggressive. I knew how to behave around the dog, making sure never to annoy him, but my then 4 year old brother didn’t. He never hurt my brother but the dog did in several occasions try to bite  other people and twice he actually did. My mom did everything she could to keep him, but after the second bite she got scared that he would some day snap and bite me or my brother, specially my brother who was still too young to understand the danger. Or that he would bite someone else again and they would sue (we didn’t have a lot of money then). So she had to rehome him. He went to many different families but they all rejected him. At the end idk what happened to him and I never asked my mom, I didn’t want her to relive that pain. I just know my mom was never again able to get another dog or pet for that matter out of guilt. However, through all of that pain and guilt, she did it because she knew it was for the best, maybe not for the dog, but for her family. 

Sometimes these things happen, and they hurt like hell. Now, I have my own dog and I cannot even begin to imagine the pain. But to this day I think what my mom did was the most selfless act she possibly could have done. Just as you are doing, it’s a selfless act and i’m sure your older dog will appreciate it immensely.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/13jibgc/rehoming_dog_feel_awful_advice_from_others_who/#jkfgpjo,,,,,,,,,,,,

My chihuahua (mixed with a shi tzu so she was very fluffy) has been with the family since 2012 and she’s been a big part of my life since we got her when i was 9 years old. She was the sweetest, silliest and most beautiful chihuahua i’ve ever seen. Truly one beautiful dog (everyone says this about their dog xD), and i loved her so much. She had an amazing life and received so much love not only from family but also friends.

She passed with her tongue sticking out from the side which most dogs do according to the vet, but i found it lighthearted and fits her personality so much. It’s good to know she’s now resting in dog heaven eating all the snacks she has ever wanted. 

Yesterday i’ve cried so much my eyes hurt but in good company with family and support from my partner managed to have a emotional but healthy goodbye. Since the parting went in a healthy way i’ve been doing good actually. Often i’d think about her and the empty hole she has now left in the house and makes me teary eyed + some body pains. 

We cleaned up all her items, sleeping beds, toys etc etc and occasionally we find her hair around the house which leaves us with a soft smile. And packaged leftover food we will give away to other dog owners who’ll need this food better then the bin.

Since this is my first family member loss i don’t know much how to proceed further tho. Does anybody have tips for the grieving process in losing their lifetime dog? Like what to avoid doing etc. I hope whoever reads this and also lost their dog is doing good and healthy right now. 
Thanks.

Thank you all for sharing your perspective on grieving, it will surely help us and me in particular. I can’t reply to all your comments since they’re so many but i read them all and to everyone who lost their dog you’re not alone and hopefully sharing your stories and experiences here is also helping yourself.

,"I lost my soulmate dog about 5 years ago. I thought I was going to drown from the grief. I’d lost dogs before and had been devastated, but this level of grief was different. I didn’t know how to deal with it and I researched grief support groups. I was too anxious to actually join any, but it was helpful to know that was an option if I needed it. I was worried I was going to forget all of my memories, so I got a dog/grief journal from Amazon, and I wrote in it as much as I could. Sometimes I cried so much my tears destroyed what I’d written, but the act itself of writing down the memories was therapeutic. 

With some time, the grief lessened. I recently lost 2 people very close to me, and have been grieving again. In my search for help, I came across a quote: “Grief is just love with nowhere to go.” I wish I’d had that thought in mind after losing my soulmate dog, because I might not have waited so long to adopt another. (As it was, I only waited 4 months, but it felt like a lot longer). Adopting another dog gave me an outlet for that grieflove that had nowhere to go. It gave me something to love, something to focus on, something to help my heart start to heal. I don’t know if you’re considering getting another dog anytime soon, but if and when you feel ready, I hope it helps you heal too. If you’re not ready for a commitment yet, maybe you could foster.

Dogs give us so many of the best days of our lives, and also the very worst. Saying goodbye is so incredibly hard. Dogs’ only flaw is that they don’t live forever. They are just too good for this world. My thoughts are with you and your family.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ewe6xa/my_dog_of_12_years_passed_away_yesterday_looking/#lizftyh,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Everyone grieves differently and there is no wrong way of doing it. 
Having worked in a shelter, I had people come in and tell us they lost their dog yesterday and can’t go on until they have another dog in the house. Grieving in your own way is the right way. 
Some people decide to never get another dog becuase it’s too painful, while others wait a year or two till they feel they are ready. 

When my most recent dogs had passed I never put anything of theirs away for nearly 6 months. I kept their very large dog beds out until I felt ready to put them away, but I never got rid of them. 
Sadness after loosing them never goes away, you just manage to deal with it differently as time passes. 
I now have a new puppy who is a year old and he really did lift me from a deep dark pace of sadness I felt after my loss.

,"I lost my best girl almost 9 months ago now. I was absolutely devastated and actually just cried about her again a couple of days ago. In the immediate days after saying goodbye, I was looking for anything to help me feel like she was still here because it felt empty without her. I made a photo album with printed pictures that I looked at daily, kept her dog bowl and collar visible in the living room, and printed out some pictures to have in the living room as well to try to help it feel like she was still here. I now have her urn (a wooden box with a picture on the front) in the living room. I talked about her a lot and actually talked to her a lot in the weeks after. I would look at the picture on her urn as I talked to her.

One thing I would say is you can't rush the process, and everyone grieves differently. Some people need to talk about it while others stay quiet. Others can get back to a normal routine pretty quickly while others need more time. I didn't verbally speak about her to anyone but my partner for weeks or maybe even months. I could text with people a bit because it gave me the space to cry and feel my emotions (also very important to do in the grieving process), but talking about it out loud was too much for me for a long time. 

Keep trying to take care of yourself as best as you can. For me, it was the worst loss in my life, and I have unfortunately lost many people. I couldn't eat much for about a week, wasn't sleeping well, and just tried to get through my responsibilities each day. I had to take it one day and sometimes one task at a time. Expect that emotions may hit you out of nowhere, and it's also okay if you find peace with it all pretty quickly. Give yourself time and grace as you navigate this difficult time.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ewe6xa/my_dog_of_12_years_passed_away_yesterday_looking/#lizjohv,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I lost my dog of almost 12 yrs (had him since he was about 8 weeks old) about 9 days ago and it was really rough as he was my constant, but friends and family rallied around me which has helped. At first it was painful to see his pictures and I gave away/hid all of his stuff but gradually started looking, sharing and receiving so many photos and videos because I realized I wasn’t alone in my grief since so many ppl loved him. Having his ashes and paw print the last 3 days has helped as he’s home again, and my parents brought me orchids to keep by his box/portrait so now I’m motivated to keep the plant alive for as long as I can despite my incredible ability to kill supposedly unkillable/hardy plants like bamboo or in a freaking Aerogarden. We all still talk to my dog like he’s still here, and it helps because just the idea of him is a comfort. I’ve also been listening to “Lucky Man” by The Verve a lot and looking at photos of his epic final day where he’s got this big smile right before his cardiac arrest. He was extremely healthy and that’s why it was such a shock, but the vet said I couldn’t have predicted/done much with a congenital issue. I still alternate between talking about him in the present/past tense ",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ewe6xa/my_dog_of_12_years_passed_away_yesterday_looking/#lizkdn8,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Aw I’m super sorry to hear that mate, i lost a very sweet friend a couple of years ago. One thing that helped me was to sit down with my phone for like 3 hours and scroll through every single life photo I had, basically relive my life with her, “this was when we went to the beach that time” “this is what she ate my hotdog and tried to hide it” “aw the new bed I got her that the cat stole”

Reliving all those memories helped me remember how good of a life I gave her. it still hurt but it was like losing a relative at 96 years old rather than losing a child. It was sad but felt fulfilling knowing I did all I could. I cried a lot at the memories and I have a tear thinking about it now. 

I’m sure you gave your friend the best life they could ever hope to have and they passed away loving you. 

I hope you find a way to grieve, my advice is to face the pain and discomfort as much as you can and become comfortable with your feelings towards the situation. Try to define a very specific vocabulary about how you feel and why you feel that way “I’m sad because I won’t see my friend any more” “I’m angry because it doesn’t feel fair” it might sound basic but it can be common to just feel “awful” or “bad” and never really understand why you feel those ways. Putting it in the open is a strong step. Putting it on paper can help too, maybe start with your feeling and then write a couple of sentences about why you feel that way. Maybe write about things you remember. Maybe write about things you are proud of doing for your friend or things you would have liked to do. 

I have a new friend now, he turned 1 yesterday. took a while to make that decision but he helps make my life better. I make sure to document his life so that I have all the memories to look back on one day… it’s not a day I look forward to but I’m glad I’ll be prepared",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ewe6xa/my_dog_of_12_years_passed_away_yesterday_looking/#lizkwxq,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I’m so sorry. It’s just the worst. What ways might you be able to memorialize her? How about naming a star in her memory? Share stories of her with other people, it’s an important part of the grieving process. Spend time thinking more about her meaning in your life and why she came to you when she did. Reach out to a pet loss grief therapist if you feel inclined, as they can help you explore your feelings and develop adaptive thoughts toward your life together and her passing.

If you don't keep their minds occupied and teach them how to relax, they will create their own jobs (usually jobs you don't want).

"[Help] My girlfriend suspects our frenchie got heat stroke while on a walk yesterday, all the signs and symptoms pointed towards it, she was fine after a while in the cool air, this morning she’s acting very strange, any advice?
By strange I mean extremely timid and reserved compared to her normal bubbly quirky attitude. Normally when we go for a walk she’s excited, today I had to drag her on a very short walk since she refused to cooperate. Maybe it’s because it was already fixing to be a really hot day out? 

I’m worried because I have to go to work soon and my girlfriend has already left and doggo will be home for about 6 hours before she gets home.

Edit: Talked it over with my vet and I’m going to take her in for observation

Edit/update: She is safely at the animal hospital for observation, in very competent hands, waiting for any news.

Update: The vet called my girlfriend, apparently everything is fine, she’s eating and drinking again, all her vitals are normal and they’re just gonna run a blood test to make sure there aren’t any underlying issues etc. Thanks for all the helpful comments! I really appreciate all the good advice as well, and I will apply all the new information to keeping her safe and cool going forward. It was likely “heat stress” and will not have any lasting effects.

Final Update: Thank you all so much for the support and advice again, next time I’ll go straight to the vet if I suspect anything may be wrong. Belle is home safe and sound and is currently resting in the A/C drinking nice cool water.

,"Good call on going to the vet (as I saw from one of your comments).

Hot weather is a bitch for dogs, especially on any kind of pavement. Pavement will add 20 degrees to the air temperature, and your dog is right down near those hot temps.

Once she starts feeling better, keep a sharp eye out on her eyes when she's walking out in the heat. Aside from heavy panting, one of the first signs of heat exhaustion in a dog is the eyes getting a bit glassy and losing focus and clarity (they look like they're staring off into space a little). You'll know it when you see it, and once you see it, end the walk and/or try to cool the dog down as best you can.

Drinking water is the obvious choice, but I've noticed our dogs will also put their paws in water and lay down on a wet surface so their underbelly gets wet.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/hdrrpg/help_my_girlfriend_suspects_our_frenchie_got_heat/#fvmvw8k,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have started keeping her inside between walks almost exclusively to help her cool down. We make a huge effort to make sure she gets water after exercise too. Do what you can in between exercise and consider only exercising during cooler times of day (early morning and later evening).

Despite surviving (we barely got her to the vet in time) it was clear she suffered at least some Brain damage and was never the same again. This may have happened to your dog?

Also, if they don't want to walk in the heat, don't force it. Breeds with pushed in faces might have a harder time breathing in these temps too. Glad your dog is okay!

Our boxer mix purposefully tries to stay outside for long periods of time in the heat, we have to drag her inside so she won't overheat.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/hdrrpg/help_my_girlfriend_suspects_our_frenchie_got_heat/#fvnn95z,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heat stroke/stress is so hard on the body that literally every organ begins to go into ""low power mode"" (that's what the ER doc told me) and apparently it's not hard for the body to do that but takes longer to 'reset'.

"What 2 pieces of advice do you want every potential dog owner to know?
I've been working with dogs for a bit now (3 years at a dog daycare/boarding facility, fostered/had dogs around a lot as a kid/teen) and I've noticed there are a staggering amount of dog owners who just don't really know how to deal with, control, or take care of their dogs. 

So, folks who are experienced with dogs, what two pieces of advice would you give to new owners? Mine are...

**1.) If you have never had a dog before, foster a puppy/adult dog before you buy or adopt one permanently (do both, preferably, if you can of the breed you want to get).** Having a ""family dog"" doesn't count - if you (or your partner/current housemates) have never had FULL ownership/full responsibility for a dog, you should foster before you bring home a puppy of your own. So, SO many people buy or adopt puppies (or even older dogs!) without understanding the sheer amount of time, energy, and money they can take up. It's also helpful to interact with ADULTS of the breed because your cute little puppy won't stay like that forever. Plus, tons of foster programs would love the help!

**2.) If you feed dry kibble to your dog, soak it first.** Okay, so this one isn't a hard and fast piece of advice, but I don't see it mentioned as much, and it can be super helpful for picky eaters or dogs who may have a harder time eating. Although sure, wet food or even raw food may be healthier/closer to a dog's natural diet than processed pieces of kibble, the reality is that not everyone wants to or is able to spend exorbitant amounts of money on their dog's food (raw food in particular is... yeesh, that pricetag!) so they fall back on kibble. But a huge drawback to kibble is the processed nature of the food (not all kibble are created equal in that regard, make sure to check on the ingredients when you're choosing a brand) and its dryness. A great way to offset the dryness is to allow the kibble to soak in a bit of water to mimic the moisture fond in canned/raw food, though you can also add broth or a different liquid if your dog is particularly picky.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/10p75rt/what_2_pieces_of_advice_do_you_want_every/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My dog doesn’t like his food. Looking for advice on what to try.
I currently feed my dog a mix of Open Farm salmon kibble and Canidae lamb wet food. In the past I have tried Purina and Royal Canin. I have tried to add things like beef liver or a bit of Greek yogurt or other treats sprinkled on top that I know he likes to encourage him to eat, and it would work but he’d eat just the top half of what’s in his bowl and leave the rest. 

He used to eat his puppy kibble but he’s 1 now, and I can’t seem to find an adult food brand that he likes. 

He definitely prefers the wet lamb food over the dry kibble. But he’s still not eating the full recommended amount. His weight is healthy though so maybe it’s not as big of a deal as I think it is? He had a vet visit recently for vaccines and they did a wellness check and said he looks healthy and perfect. But I just don’t want him to lack proper nutrition. 

He doesn’t get much treats throughout the day because I’m trying to get him to be hungry enough to eat his full meal. Ive also tried increasing his exercise/activity to see if that would get him to be hungrier. 

Any recommendations on some good food brands that your dogs love that I could try? Or anything else I could do with his current food to encourage him to eat? ",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1dpv6an/my_dog_doesnt_like_his_food_looking_for_advice_on/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Since your dog’s weight is healthy, and he’s had a recent checkup, he’s eating enough. I find that the portion sizes advised on some dog food brands are too large for my dogs. 

We used to have a dog who was a very picky eater. I once took him to a store that sold all kinds of fancy brands of dog food and they offered him samples of several. He wouldn’t touch them and even turned his nose up at treats the store owner claimed that all dogs love. We also tried various toppers and he was still picky. 

In the end, we selected a nutritious food that the vet recommended (royal canin) and put out a reasonable portion twice a day. After 15 minutes we removed uneaten food, and didn’t offer anything else until the next meal time. 

He ate nothing for two days, then decided to chow down. After that, he wasn’t so picky because he’d learned that if he didn’t eat,  nothing better would be offered. He was naturally lean, but healthy, so this was the best solution for us. The vet said a healthy dog wouldn’t starve himself for more than two days and he was right.

"[Discussion]Our dog of 15 years is passing away tonight. I need advice on how to cope
Our boy, ozzy, hasnt been doing well past few months. We got him when I was 11, I'm now 26.

We knew his time was coming. We were preparing for it. We made an appointment for Monday to put him down, as we knew it was his time.

Sadly, it seems his time was tonight. Hes on my living room floor just laying down. Has no strength. Barely moves and only moves to follow me with his head when I walk out of the room.

We cant get him euthanized because the nearest vet that does night calls or whatever is 70 miles away. He doesnt seem to be in pain, and we dont want to stress him out.

I've never lost a pet like this, due to old age or anything. I dont know what to do. I'm balling my eyes out and I know I'm gonna be a wreck tonight. I'm tired but im staying awake so he knows im here.

Edit: he passed away sometime between 4 and 430 am. He woke me up whining and struggling with his body half off his bed. I got him back up on the bed, and he wanted to lay facing me. So once I rolled him over he calmed down. Last thing I remmeber was falling asleep petting him. Woke up minutes later and he was gone.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/bcax0r/discussionour_dog_of_15_years_is_passing_away/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"There are some services that come to your house to help your pet across the rainbow bridge, and they sometimes can do emergency bookings. I know of one in the US called Lap of Love. We had them come over for one of our dogs when she had to go, and it was very very comforting. They take a paw imprint and cut off some fur for you to keep and they are super understanding and caring with everything. They even brought pee pee pads for her to lay on when the sedative takes affect. If you can’t get an opening with a company like that then just stay by his side for as long as he’s here. Telling him you love him, maybe feeding him his favorite foods (if he can eat). But also try not to bother him I guess. Just let him know that you are there and he is safe.

RIP Ozzy.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/bcax0r/discussionour_dog_of_15_years_is_passing_away/#ekpzcyu,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Hi.  I used to work as a receptionist at veterinary hospitals, and part of my job was being with people while they made their decisions about the last moments of their dog's life.  I hope I can give you some insight into dogs, their death, and what their humans mean for them.

It's hard on our end, because as humans we're an emotional bunch, and we tend to place our own feelings into our pets.  But I can say for a fact that dogs are a lot more simple than we are.  Not that they don't feel emotions, because they certainly do, but their point of view is very different than ours are.

Ozzy was a lucky boy in a lot of ways when it comes to being a dog.  He was the one chosen by your family, and the family that chose him happened to be one that A) really liked dogs, B) committed to raising a dog through his whole life, and C) cared enough to form strong bonds, ensured he stayed healthy enough to live long, and nurturing enough that he was given lots of comfort at the end of his life.  In that way, Ozzy was an incredibly lucky boy.  If you think about how many dogs there are in the world, and how many of them live in terrible conditions, are starving, sick or abused, it really puts into perspective how amazing a life Ozzy had.  He was the 1% of dogs who have the best life in the whole world.

Ozzy was also lucky enough that he got to see you grow into an adult.  Think about that.  He was with you when you were eleven years old, so he got to see you in middle school and high school, got to meet all your friends and any partners you may have had over the years.  He got to join in on family celebrations held at home, got to be there to help you and your family during hard times, always smiling and happy to have you and your family around.

And really, that's the thing to remember.  Ozzy and other dogs who live in homes like yours are genuinely happy.  They don't fake their happiness, they just *are*.  And just like all other dogs, they also have a time span of living.  No matter what happens around them, they only get a certain set of years to live, and that's it.  Same as humans, once we reach a certain number set, there's not much we can do.  Unlike humans, however, dogs aren't really the type to think about their death.  They just want to be with you as much as possible, because that's what makes them happy.  They evolved from wolves (or wolf-like creatures) specifically to form that bond with us.

You can really feel that bond in your own words, how you describe Ozzy wanting to face you for his last few moments.  He may have needed comforting, sure, but I think that more than anything, Ozzy wanted to comfort you as well.  He probably wasn't sad, he was probably warm and comfortable next to you, with your hand stroking his side, petting him as you normally would.  Like you have for his entire life.

You and your family gave Ozzy the best life he could have had on this earth.  You gave him incredibly happy moments, and he loved you for all of it.  It's painful for us when we lose a dog because we have to go on living with the memory of them, but dogs are lucky in the fact that they don't have to miss us like we miss them.  Their lives are short, but so much more fulfilling than we realize.  You and your family did good by him.  I hope you are proud of that fact.

I'm a firm believer that dogs have shorter life spans for a reason.  I'm not saying religion is that reason, because I'm not religious, but I do think it allows those of us who love dogs to give as many dogs as we possibly can the amazing life that they deserve.  Your Ozzy was amazing, and if you had 100 dogs after him, he'd still be the only dog with his personality, and you'd remember him for it.  I won't tell you to go out and get another dog, because mourning takes time - for some longer than others.  But I will say that you and your family are awesome for being so good to Ozzy, even during his last moments, and I hope you can give the same life to another dog who will be lucky enough to follow in Ozzy's footsteps.

For now, try and remember all the amazing times you had with Ozzy and keep those memories strong.  He was a good boy.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/bcax0r/discussionour_dog_of_15_years_is_passing_away/#ekqd3j5,,,,,,,,,,,,

When your baby's quality of life has such a drastic change, you need to decide if you want to give humane euthanasia or have them go naturally. After watching my parents dogs die naturally, I will always choose euthanasia.  We give a sedative, so they are comfortable,  and they go without pain. Losing yourself is an awful thing to go through, even for a dog.  
Choose end of life options that will bring you comfort. If you keep your ashes, you can always choose to distribute them later.

The only thing that I would have done differently was, I would have let my male Papillon, Radar, go sooner than I did. I look back now, and I see how incredibly selfish I was. He suffered for many months before I finally made the decision to let him go. 

I had Radar and Roxie cremated, and they are both held in a single butterfly shaped urn on my bookshelf in my office.  Each one has a framed favorite picture along with their collars.

When Radar passed I did not get another dog right away. I waited almost a year. 

I know this is an incredibly hard decision. Just hang in there and do what’s best for you and your dog.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1j25gf2/need_advice_for_end_of_life_dog/#mfpdsp9,,,,,,,,,,,,

He would just give this look with his big eyes like he loved us but was just tired and done. We cremated in a group cremation and didn't want his ashes. My personal memorial is a picture box with his paw print in clay, his favourite toy, and a photo of him. I think someone else in the family kept his collar. It's been three years and I've finally decided I'm ready for another, will probably be adopting a pup next year. 

The only thing I would have changed is euthanising at home rather than at the vet office, but I don't think he really cared at that point so long as he had us there.

When I had to make that same tough call for my girl after a failed surgery, I asked the vet if we could go outside. She kindly agreed, and I carried Daisy out to the grass where we sat together one last time. I held her head in my lap and told her everything I wanted to say— what a good girl she was, that I love her always and would never forget her, that soon she wouldn’t hurt anymore— and she seemed calmer in that moment than she had in all her painful days post-surgery. The vet asked if I was ready and very discreetly gave her the shot. I held her for a few more minutes before we left. I’m so glad her last moments were out in the sunshine instead of a cold table in a sterile office room. So grateful to that vet for her flexibility and empathy on such a hard, terrible day.

"Doggie daycare - advice
My little 7 lb, dog has been going to doggie daycare, once a week for almost the past two years. I started taking her as soon as she had all her shots/vaccinations.  I was thinking it helped her with socializing.  She does shake when I am taking her to doggie daycare, and seems happy when I pick her up.  I have asked in the past and thought all was good, until this past week. 

One of the daycare workers told me she is afraid of him and some of the other workers.  He also said she is very timid and stays to herself and doesn’t socialize with the other dogs. 

I had to go back to the room the small dogs are kept in to get her, as she was growling and backed up into a corner not and letting the worker pick her up. She’s not a biter, but will growl when she doesn’t like what you’re doing . 

It’s the first time I have seen her behavior and heard this feedback.  I’m now thinking she is very afraid at daycare and maybe it’s not a good place for her anymore.  

I’d like some advice/opinions on what to do. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1eumupc/doggie_daycare_advice/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I’m gonna be real, when I worked at a daycare most of the dogs did not want to be there. They seem excited when they’re dropped off because it’s a really overstimulating environment, and that amps them up. But then they get really riled and there’s nowhere for them to go. It’s just a lot of emotions from all sides, and at least where I worked we were understaffed and could not keep an eye on every dog at all times, so it was impossible to catch subtle body language before a situation like a fight happened. Most of the puppies seemed to actually have fun, then they’d hit one or two and are just not into being around a bunch of strange dogs in a room for hours. 

I’ve seen posts here explaining some daycares that sound really great, but that was not my experience working at one and I’ve definitely never seen one like Reddit describes in person.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1eumupc/doggie_daycare_advice/#lild3eg,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Get her out of there.

Some dogs do well in play group. Some do not. Some may not do well at first but over time get better. Some get worse. Many places that offer daycare get it wrong. Usually only pairing by size not by temperament. Employees rarely have the right training. And quite frankly many places take advantage of people who do not know the signs or what to look for in their dogs. 

This place failed you because behavior like that does not happen overnight and this type of thing should have been brought to your attention long before now. The other downside is it likely did not start out this way so by being so trusting it has really set you back. If you have better more equipped and professional options I would investigate them, ask questions etc. I would also now focus on getting a trainer and working on socialization before this becomes a lifelong problem for you and your poor dog.

I really am so sorry you’re going through this and hope you’re able to pivot so this type of behavior can improve. No one likes feeling like an unbalanced anxious mess especially your little pup!

,"I was just talking to my trainer about this because my dog was getting an increase in yellow cards. He's 3 and she said that's typically when dogs become less social and active. Like as a kid you could play on the playground all day with you friends, but as an adult you'd probably rather watch a movie and chill with a drink. I've also noticed even with his one-on-one playdates they used to be 1.5 hours of straight wrestling and now they tussle for 15 minutes and just hang out together the rest of the time. 

It's not a sign your dog is a bad dog, just that she's overstimulated and would prefer a calmer activity. The daycare around us has an enrichment camp where the dogs only do a an hour or two of playing a day and then the rest if training, 1:1 playing, and enrichment - she might like that better if you think she still wants some socializing.

,"A 7lb dog is very delicate, and it's completely natural for her to be anxious! I'd stop taking her to that daycare and let her rest and decompress. After that, you can look into other forms of socialization like playdates with one other small dog at a time. I've posted on neighborhood facebook groups (Nextdoor would also be good) to find potential doggy friends for playdates. 

You could also look for a trainer who does small group excursions like 'pack walks,' but I'd be very careful to find one who works with other small dogs. Not all trainers have a lot of experience with smaller or anxious dogs, and you need someone who can help her feel safe and build her confidence.

"Hi guys, I'm a qualified Veterinary Surgeon and here's some advice on spotting seasonal allergies in your pooch... :)
Hi guys, Dr Rayana aka 'The Happy Vet' here :) 

Does your dog have patches of angry, red skin between their toes, or around their ears or eyes? Do you keep seeing them shake their head, scratch continuously or rub away at their ears or muzzle? And what about frequent licking or nibbling of their paws? If the answer to any of those is yes – and there’s no obvious source of irritation – your dog may have a summer pollen allergy, so get them checked out by your vet :)

**What to do:** The key to keeping your dog’s allergy under control is to watch the pollen count just as any hay fever sufferer would – and step things up on the pet hygiene front. Brush your dog every day, and wipe down their muzzle and paws with pet wipes after walks. Try walking them at dawn or dusk, when pollen levels are likely to be lower. And it may not make you popular with your pooch, but washing them every week will help get rid of any lingering pollen! Your vet can also prescribe topical treatments and medications.

"Potty training advice needed ‼️
⭐️update, dog is now peeing inside the crate as well


Just adopted a 10 month old lab mix from a shelter. He is about 65 pounds. He is mostly potty trained, but still having so many accidents in the house. He seems to go both outside and inside. We don't scold him when he goes inside, as we read not to. We excitedly praise him and give him a treat when he goes outside. We've been using the same phrases
""go potty"" and ""good potty"". He is very smart and knows lots of other tricks. However, he is going potty both outside and inside still.
He gets two meals a day, and doesn't have an upset stomach. It's both poop and pee accidents. He knows it's wrong, as he waits until our backs are turned to go in the house and cowers afterwards. He is able to hold it all throughout the night, so l am not suspecting UTI. Especially given that it's both poop and pee accidents. What is going on here ? Is it normal for him to need to go so frequently? He will sometimes potty inside after he just went outside two hours ago....What should we do?

,I don’t have a ton of experience but I will say my smarty pants Doberman was difficult to potty train. She did the same thing with just going inside at random even if I’d let her out right before. What worked was having very special potty only treats (it was bits of hotdogs lol). She only got these if she pottied outside. It backfired a bit when she started asking to go out every hour and fake peeing when I’d say “go potty” but that was better than going in the house.

i'd go after every time he ate/drank something - at least for a while, till he gets used to it.  
when my girl was still a puppy and not potty trained, we went down with her like every 30 minutes in the beginning. till no accidents happened anymore.

when an accident happens, how do you clean? you need to remove the smell (for the dog nose), otherwise it will always smell like toilet to the dog.  
normal cleaning products, that work for us, might still leave a smell for the dog.   
we always used cleaning vinegar, that removes all pee smell even for a dog nose.

If you have a yard, only unclip puppy after business is done and you’ve partied.

Pups usually go potty right after waking up from naps, and 15-30 minutes after a meal. I have an 8 month old at home and he’s pretty good at timing it because I have him on a schedule so his bladder is trained. Here’s an example of a potty schedule that we stick to:

7am walkies — 20-30mins; 
12pm potty break — 10mins; 
5pm walkies — 30-40mins; 
9pm potty break — 5mins

"[Discussion] For the past 1.5yrs, my pup has completely destroyed every stuffed toy I have bought for him. I got him this stuffed pig a couple weeks ago and he hasn’t destroyed it yet. Does anyone understand dog behavior and what would cause him to ‘change his mind’ about this new toy?
My dog loves destroying stuffed animals. And though it has been expensive, he actually seems like he enjoys stuffed toys more than hard toys. He has a basket full of ‘indestructible’ chew toys that he never touches. He also likes balls but only gets them when we are on a walkabout or at the dog park.

Because of that, at least every couple of weeks I’ll buy him a ‘max toughness stuffed dog toy’ and he’ll sit down with it and meticulously chew at the seams and corners until he can rip out all the stuffing and squeakers (he doesn’t squeak the squeakers oddly enough).

He can completely destroy a toy within 5m if he just focuses on it, or it can last for at least an hour if he also plays with it and tosses it around. After he has destroyed the toy, I’ll dispose of all the stuffing and small fabric pieces. He usually gets to keep the ‘skin’ of the stuffed animal until he starts ripping it into chunks and eating it, which happens anywhere between 1-2 days after.

I bought him this pink stuffed pig a couple weeks ago and somehow he still hasn’t destroyed it. He’ll nibble on parts of it and squeeze it in his mouth but has not created any large holes. A couple of times now, he’s greeted me at the door with it in his mouth when I come home (he has NEVER done anything like that before). He will also nap with it or lay next to it.

I thought maybe I had finally found a truly ‘max toughness dog toy’ and went back to the store to buy the elephant version by the same manufacturer. I gave it to him the other day and and he completely murdered the toy within 20m or so. The pig is still ok.

I’m surprised and happy that he found a toy that he is keeping around, but was curious to know if anyone here that understands dog behavior could shed some light on this sudden favoritism that my dog has exhibited for the first time in two years.

,"We experienced the same thing with our German Shepherd! For the first 3 years of her life she would tear up every toy and get the squeaker out, as if she were on a mission. Then, we got her this weird multi-colored toy that she loved and she would always bring it to the door to greet us when we got home. We also called it her baby! She stopped chewing up toys as badly as she did but that one always stayed safe and she would go to get it from her bin whenever someone was coming in through the door to bring it to them! No idea what made that one so special to her.

"This is probably more about human behavior but how do you leave your dog and not feel massive guilt? 
Hello I have an Australian Cattle Dog and he’s pretty much been my life since I got him in 2020. He does everything with me or I don’t do it. 

He’s crate trained but only goes in there if it’s really needed. Food shopping or doctors appointments. 

That said I’m going to the movies tonight and took him for a nice walk then fetch. I also took him to In and Out for a dog patty. 

I love him he’s my best friend but how do I not feel guilty about leaving him for a few hours?

I should also note I am work from home so he really is with me 24/7

Edit: thanks everyone for responding! I am trying to answer everyone but wanted to say tonight went well. He slept while I was gone and we have been playing fetch with his favorite ball!

,"So we got our dog precovid, and he was on a regular schedule of alone 8 hours a day while we worked. Then COVID happened and we had to shift to WFH and his schedule was *fucked and he hated us.*

He just wanted to sleep all day like he was used to, so he would glare at us whenever we made too much noise or interrupted him. There were a lot of heavy sighs, getting up and walking to another spot to glare with whale eyes, or leaving the room when we entered to go sleep in the bedroom away from us. He was also overtired and overstimulated in the evenings, zooming like mad and manically pawing at us for attention, and then when we went to bed he'd be up several times a night. 

When we went back to regular work he was so relieved. We had our nice schedule of walkie in the morning, pee immediately after work followed by a cuddle nap, followed by a big walkie and then dinner, then play, then cuddles then bed. He was so happy! He slept the night through and was calm and collected.

Then we got a puppy. The puppy has a magic Houdini gene so no matter how we barricaded her into one room, she got out for months and kept our dog up all day so he was wonky again. 

Finally we figured out a solution so he is back to getting to sleep all day and puppy is sequestered in another room.

"Abusive behavior towards animals isn’t always overtly obvious or violent.
Today I got to thinking about the way my ex treated my disabled dog.

I have a shelter chihuahua who has a bunch of congenital issues (one of my vets thinks it’s something to do with her coat type). She’s always been deaf and has trouble seeing unless something is directly in front of her or the place is brightly lit.

Sometimes, she’s really startled and starts yelping frantically if she sees someone far away at night. Or if someone rapidly walks up from behind her. That immediately changes when she gets a proper look at the person, tho. That’s when her tail wags so fast her butt dances, she happy spins & etc etc.

My ex would get so uncharacteristically angry over this. One of the first things he said when he saw my dog was “God, I hate chihuahuas”. 

He used to say she was disrespectful (?) when she’d yelp and that she probably wasn’t even deaf, just pretending to avoid following orders (even though he was present during several vet visits dealing with her eyes and deafness).

Ex liked to randomly poke her face and flank. He’d flick her ears over and over to try to annoy her cus “A proper dog needs to be ok with anything a human does without getting angry.” She never snapped at him. My dog would usually turn her head away then and ignore him. He’d take it as evidence that “See? She’s already getting pissed. All chihuahuas are like that”. You’d think chihuahuas murdered his mom or smth from the sheer disdain he had.

I’ll always regret not dumping him the moment he ranted about how much he hates chihuahuas. I was an idiot all “He doesn’t know friendly chihuahuas yet. My girl will win him over with her friendliness.” And she *did* try. 

Coquine attempted many times to initiate cuddles or play time, bringing him her toys or placing her face against his leg. She would go through her repertoire of tricks, unprompted. He’d ignore it in favor of ear flicking thing and/or tugging her tail cus “This is how I play with my cats. *Real* dogs like this too.”

Yeah, no, that wasn’t it at all.  My poor dog probably had no idea what she’d done wrong for this one human to insist on antagonizing her.

I later realized my ex’s behaviour with animals in general was a symptom. Abusiveness isn’t always a huge display of blatant violence. It can be things like going out of your way to punish your SO’s pet for daring to exist.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/r7ka24/abusive_behavior_towards_animals_isnt_always/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I think one of my dogs just corrected my other dog's bad behavior. Are they that smart?
This was just interesting to me. Has anyone else seen a dog correct another dog's bad behavior?

I have two dogs, one is a purebred German Shepherd named Bodacious and the other is a German Shepherd mix named Storm. They're great and they have this ""good dog, naughty dog"" dynamic where Bodacious is always perfectly behaved and refined and lives his life to please, while Storm is a good boy, but is always looking for mischief and doesn't care what his humans think about it 😜

One day I was playing with both of them in the yard, when Storm found a turtle crawling in the grass (we live on a lake). Storm was going crazy, trying to bite at the turtle's shell and grab its legs. 

I walked Bodacious over to the side and put him in a down-stay, then came to the turtle and tried to pick it up, in order to carry it back to the lake. Storm was giving me a hassle, as he kept attempting to bite at the turtle and grab it from my hands. No matter what I did to prevent him or get him to stop, he refused to listen to anything I said or did. 

Then, in one swift motion, Bodacious sprung up from his down position and nipped Storm. Storm yelped, backed away from me and the turtle, and Bodacious went right back to the spot where I left him in a down. After that, Storm didn't give me any more trouble as I carried the turtle to the lake. 

I thought that surely this was just a coincidence, until I told my trainer the story, and she said that she has seen her German Shepherds correct another's behavior like this before.

"“Neuter doesn’t change behavior”
I just had an interview appointment for my 5 year old Catahoula Leopard at Camp Bow Wow. While I was in the interview room with the dog trainer viewing him on the tv the following conversation took place:

Trainer: “Neutering dogs had no effect on their behavior. Veterinarians lie about it but I’m telling you the absolute truth.”

Me: “Hmmm, that goes against everything I’ve ever heard. Why do you think that.”

“All my years of experience as a trainer.”

“How long has that been?”

“5 years.”

“And what is the training curriculum for becoming a dog trainer?”

“I did it mostly online. I used to clean this facility and now I’m the dog trainer.”

“And it’s your opinion that neutering dogs  has zero effect on their behavior?”

“Absolutely. I’m telling you the truth.”

I’m blown away!! Isn’t that a wild thing to say as a representative of a dog day care and boarding facility? 

I made an appointment at Dogtopia for tomorrow. We’ll see what they are like. I’m blown away.



Edit: For sure there is legitimacy to dogs who already grown being neutered and it not being a magic solution for poor behavior. Obviously.

"Considering behavioral euthanasia
I’m currently fostering a shepherd mix that I rescue pulled from a shelter back in November 2024. I managed to rescue her within HOURS of scheduled euthanasia.

The volunteers and workers at the shelter misled and/or did not properly behavioral test this dog when I was considering pulling her. I was told that she was timid and skittish, but showed no aggression issues the three months she was there. It led me into a false sense of security thinking that she would be ok to foster, and if she did have behavioral issues, it would likely be trainable.

Within the first couple of weeks of me having her, she started to show aggression and reactivity issues. She’s mainly ok around me, but strangers, animals, children and sometimes even cars trigger her into a hyper aggressive state.

Sometimes when I feel safe enough to sleep with her, if my feet even accidentally brush against her, she jolts up and gives a pre-bite growl until she realizes it’s me. Even though she hasn’t bit anyone yet, she has come close.

I have taken her to the rescue’s designated professional trainer, she has shown slight improvement in the training sessions, but as soon as she’s in a home setting, she reverts. Trainer says she needs to go through board/train, but neither I nor the rescue has 5k lying around to rehabilitate.

I’m currently trying to convince the owner of the rescue to allow behavioral euthanasia on this dog. It makes me feel like a murderer, especially when I love this cutie and how she helped me get through the death of my soul dog. But unfortunately, I cannot guarantee the public’s safety and it’s exhausting being her caretaker. 

Edit: I should clarify that I’m not jumping on this right away and that 3-4 months is short for a dog to acclimate. But I’m thinking in the sense, if she does not show improvement in the next 4 months ( AKA 8 months-1 yr total). Then it should be considered.

I also can’t help, but to think about how these resources could be going to a much more adoptable dog.

From those who have faced this; I would love to hear from you. Is there anything that you wish you have done differently? Do you feel like you did right by your pet? Does the guilt ever go away? What was the point at which you felt like this was the correct decision to make? etc.

TLDR : I’m considering behavioral euthanasia for a current foster dog. Looking for input from those who have faced this issue.

,">... I was told that she was timid and skittish, but showed no aggression issues the three months she was there. It led me into a false sense of security...

That's because rescues have different behavior they show in a shelter than in a home. Some do better, some stay the same and some do worse. Unfortunately, in your case, she did worse.

This is because shelters are very stressing to dogs. They are often loud with so many sounds, smells and sights that are overwhelming. Not to mention the fact that dogs don't get the needed physical and mental stimulation they need because it's a temporary home and you have dogs that behave different than normal. There's a high chance she shut down at the shelter rather than acting out.

>Sometimes when I feel safe enough to sleep with her, if my feet even accidentally brush against her, she jolts up and gives a pre-bite growl until she realizes it’s me. Even though she hasn’t bit anyone yet, she has come close.

Absolutely do not put her in a situation where she can practice this behavior. She is not and never will be safe enough to sleep around. When you can't keep an eye on her, she should be in a kennel.

>I have taken her to the rescue’s designated professional trainer, she has shown slight improvement in the training sessions, but as soon as she’s in a home setting, she reverts. Trainer says she needs to go through board/train, but neither I nor the rescue has 5k lying around to rehabilitate.

This is wrong advice. There is nothing the trainer is going to be able to do because the dog is reacting to the environment. Taking the dog out of the environment to train is pointless because, like you said, the dog will revert back once she comes back home. You need a trainer to come to your home and work with her but if they shelter's trainer isn't willing to then you're out of luck. 

I don't think you're the right person to handle this (not to any fault of yours, there's just a lot that comes with managing dog aggression) so I just suggest bringing her back to the shelter. Yes, it's more than likely that they'll euth her but that's what you're planning anyway. I know this may be your first encounter with an aggressive dog but sometimes you just have to pick your battles.

The difference between an aggressive dog that can be helped and an aggressive dog that can't is how they respond to training. You already said she isn't when in your home, which is going to carry to any home. That means she's not safe to place in a home. Her only other option would be a sanctuary that focuses on aggressive dogs but they're few and far between.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ixp0ue/considering_behavioral_euthanasia/#meo8yda,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I also adopted a dog with similar and much more aggressive behaviour. I could not get a collar on him without wearing welding gloves to protect from his strong bite (he’s got a Rottweiler jaw strength). He often didn’t even warn with a growl and bit right away. If your walked to close to him he’d aggressively bite your foot. It took a lot of patience, consistency, time and sometimes creative training techniques until you find out what works.  For some dogs medication works when combined with training. I learned that using a mussel during training was not a cruel thing but actually shows compassion for the dog. Allowed me to expose my dog to things to desensitize him without having to be scared because of his aggression. Took over two years of consistency etc. and understanding what your dog needs to be set up for success. For my dog, routine and predicability were important as well as slow desensitization. My dogs now seven and whenever people learn about my first few years with him they can’t believe it because he is now an extremely affectionate dog that seeks out comfort from humans. He still has certain triggers but because I’m aware of them it’s become second nature to predict them before they arise. He has not been aggressive with anyone since then.

,"While reactivity is bad, it doesn't sound like this dog has bitten anyone or any other dog (yet). It is possible that she is actually dangerous and would follow through with a bite if allowed, but it's also possible that it's mostly noise and showing teeth when she is startled/scared. Growling shouldn't actually be discouraged, because some dogs will learn to hide their fear and bite without warning, which is infinitely worse. If her reactivity is only fear-based (and not a neurological problem, aggression from abuse/ dog fighting etc), then it is possible she will improve with safe socialization. As a precaution, I would suggest taking her out always with a muzzle, if you're not doing it already. Since she can't bite anyone with a muzzle, you can feel calmer about engaging with her, and she will benefit from your lack of fear/frustration/adrenaline.

Another thought I had, if she has shepherd in her, it could also be that she's hyperfixating on the moving things you encounter on walks (cars is a big clue too) because she has nothing else to focus on. Training that mixes in agility or more physically intense exercise could help to drain her anxious energy before you tackle ""how to walk calmly on a leash"". I have a dog that is anxious around people, so if I'm getting visitors I make sure she's exercised well first, and it makes a huge difference to how reactive she is. If your dog's walks are her only exercise AND it's where you're seeing the reactivity, then it will be very difficult to change her default reactions. She has a lot of anxious energy and probably now anticipates walks with you as being high-stress (which is also why she behaves better around the trainer).

More on training reactivity on walks: As I mentioned, don't discourage her barking/growling but rather reward her when she's not reacting (around a trigger). To do this, you need to find out how close you can get to a trigger before she reacts, and work in that ""zone"" with positive reinforcement, until you can get closer/extend the exposure. If she reacts to something, it's likely too late to get her to stop (at this stage of her training) so you need to only focus on pre-emptive redirection. E.g. If you know a trigger on walks is a person approaching, before she notices, start training a sit/stay/shake paw/ or heelwork, keeping her busy as the trigger passes at a safe distance. Reward if she ignores the trigger. If she becomes reactive, that means you've gone too fast/too close to the trigger and you know next time you need more distance to keep her focus on you. If she reacts, do not punish her or pull her away, just pause and let the person pass by while remaining calm. Wait until she's calm, even if this takes 10 minutes. Eventually, she will think, why are we standing here? Then, she'll look up at you, and that is when you reward her with a ""good girl"" or a treat, and continue your walk immediately. Many repetitons of this, and finding out how close you can get to a trigger without her reacting, will build your bond and eventually, she will start ""checking in"" with you (making eye contact or a pause), when she sees a trigger instead of instantly reacting.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ixp0ue/considering_behavioral_euthanasia/#mepsedj,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I had a great Dane that took about 6 months. He was reactive but not aggressive, fortunately. I had a lab mix that took a year. She was aggressive but settled in about 3 months into just barking and growling. In a year she was a normal dog. My method with her was lots of positive physical contact. She slept next to my bed and could get in if she wanted, which she eventually did.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ixp0ue/considering_behavioral_euthanasia/#meq1kfh,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This doesn't sound to me like a justified case for having her put down. It sounds like you bit off more then you could chew. But the dog might be able to live a good fulfilling life with the right person and supervision.

It's not the same but I can relate a little bit. This dog  hasn't even bit anyone or injured anyone.

Usually dogs have to bite multiple times to get into that territory.

It's probably scary and I understand that.

"[link] New study confirms significant social and emotional developmental benefits for children under the age of 5 who grow up around dogs: fewer conduct problems, peer problems, total difficulties and increased prosocial behavior
The bond between dogs and children can be remarkably strong. If you need proof just look at the countless viral videos of dogs and babies exhibiting very cute and very real friendships. Having a dog growing up is a quintessential childhood experience for many, and often the staple of tear-jerking dog-centred family films. Now, new research confirms there are significant social and emotional developmental benefits for children under the age of 5 who grow up around dogs.

Bringing a dog into the home of an already hectic family can seem like an unnecessary, stressful, and often expensive responsibility. However, a new study suggests it might be worth yielding to the demands of pre-school children who want a dog of their own, and it may even help them stand out from their non dog-owning peers.

An investigation into the effect of active play and walking with the family dog in pre-school children found significant differences between children who live with a family dog and those who do not. According to a detailed parental survey, children from dog-owning households had fewer conduct problems, peer problems and fewer total difficulties, while also showing more prosocial behaviour when compared to children without a dog. What’s more, children who played with or walked their dog more often had markedly better prosocial behaviour than those who were less interactive. This study confirms that having a furry friend, even in early childhood, can encourage children to be better behaved, more active and be a ready source of stress relief.

,"So many positives to dog ownership IF THE DOG IS TREATED LIKE A BELOVED FAMILY MEMBER.  I'm a teacher and my opinion is that families with well-treated dogs:

have had conversations with their children about how to treat animals that can't/won't defend themselves

have assigned chores in regards to the care of the animal that even little children can help with

have shown that anyone in the family can express love and emotions, even big strong daddies

have had to deal with accidents or even disasters (looking at you my Great Dane who loves exploring the trash can) with humor or calm actions

Sadly, all the opposites are true for kiddos who come from families with dogs who are left in the yard and ignored for the majority of their days. These kids think it's fine to 'forget' about pets until they are convenient. They don't have regular chores and resent the few things they are occasionally told to do. They don't have empathy for others who can not express themselves in expected way. 

I could go on. Of course, I'm making huge over-generalizations and am frankly biased from my years of experience with pets and with so many years with children.

"PSA: Pandemic Dog Price Increase Has Lead to Huge Increase In Dog Thefts/Abductions! Stay Aware and Keep An Eye Out For Suspicious Behavior.
I just saw a [Report on Vice](https://youtu.be/D1yi_mUwIA8) that highlights just how much of an increase there is, in the horrible act of stealing dogs from their owners.

They lure them away on walks (so keep leashed and walking by your side) or even brazenly take from the owners backyard or even house. So ensure cameras are installed and keep watch over your dogs when you let them out in the yard, and lock your doors, even when home.

They are even removing and replacing the micro-chips from pet dogs.

They either use the stolen dogs to breed puppy litters (if they are a profitable breed) or just sell them to someone else.

If you are buying a dog, especially online, please do your research and ensure it is from a reputable dog breeder and ask questions. Good dog breeders are often quite proud of their work, either the lineage of the dog, the many years/ litters of experience, records/immunization records etc.

If any breeders or those with experience buying from reputable breeders have any tips on what to look/ask for, it would be appreciated if you could add this knowledge to help ensure that this horrible practice doesn't continue.

I don't mean to fearmonger, yet the knowledge of this issue and raised awareness can greatly reduce the chance of a member of your family being taken.

,"I purchased from a breeder, so if someone is selling a stolen dog one key sign would be where are the parents? As you said, any reputable breeders will be happy to show you the parents and lineage records.

For the poor babies being stolen and then forced to breed, once again I’d ask for records on the lineage of the puppies (this time focusing on grandparents). Check the ages of the parents. If the dog used to belong to a good family, most likely they would be neutered/spayed so they wouldn’t be in this situation. If they were stolen before this could happen most likely the thieves will breed them right away (during the first heat cycle) which can be damaging to females and would never happen with a responsible breeder.

It goes without saying, but I don’t recommend buying off of Craigslist or anything like that, because that’s most likely where these thieves will try to sell the dogs. If, for whatever reason, you choose to go this route please check around on local (and even a few towns over) lost dog social media pages and vets to make sure the dog you are interested in is not someone else’s. Then immediately have them checked by the vet for a micro-chip.

"What dog behavior do you do to bond with your dog?
Last week, for the heck of it, when my dog greeted me for the first time in the morning I sniffed all over his snout, just to see how he’d react. 

He seemed delighted, like “ah, he gets it,” and started licking my face, something he doesn’t usually do that often. 

Now that’s how I greet him and he always gets excited. I haven’t decided if we’re connecting in a new way or if he’s humoring me, the way we laugh when it looks he’s talking. Either way, he seems to really respond. 

(I draw the line at sniffing anywhere else, though. Sorry, boy.)

"[Help] My 11 year old boxer died and my 8 year old Saint Bernard has had a sudden change in behavior.
Hey, y’all. My boxer who was 11 years old passed away on April Fools and my Saint Bernard has had a sudden change in behavior. They pretty much almost grew up together. I got the Saint Bernard as a companion to my boxer when my boxer was three and the Saint Bernard was a puppy. I didn’t want the boxer to be alone when I was at work. They became the best of friends and would eat together and pretty much were inseparable for eight years. When he fell ill, my Saint Bernard knew something was up. Since his passing she has had such a sudden change in behavior that I don’t know what to do. She was eating a bit the first couple of days, then stopped. She had been lethargic and distant. She sleeps the whole day. She hasn’t stopped drinking water and will bark when dogs walk by but she refuses to do anything. I gave her some rice with her food the other day but she refused to eat it. I tried chicken with her dog food and she ate most of the chicken but not the dog food. I gave her a couple of weenies which she ate and some meat today but she didn’t really eat it. She had a little diarrhea today, very minimal but pretty much hasn’t eaten in two days. I’ve never gone thru something like this as I’ve always had one dog and this is the first time I had two. I have a Shitzu as well that I introduced a year ago but she doesn’t really pay him much attention to him. She’ll occasionally bark at him when he’s trying to play, but you can tell she’s annoyed by him. Just reaching out to see if y’all have ever dealt with this. Any comments are appreciated.

,"Our dogs did this when my husband was killed.  My husband always said that the best kind of dog was someone else’s dog.  But he finally agreed to getting dogs when we returned from living overseas and bought a house.  My husband and the dogs were bonded from just about the moment we picked up the dogs from the shelter.  When my husband would come home from work, he’d ask, “Where are the girls?”....He was usually talking about the dogs and not our human daughters.  When my husband died, our dogs whined and cried for him for weeks.  This was really strange to us because they’d never reacted that way even when he went away for months on deployment.  Anyway, whenever they saw someone in uniform, they’d run up to them thinking it was my husband.  As soon as they realized it wasn’t him, their disappoint was almost palpable and the whining and crying would begin again.  At home, the dogs would lay in the closet for hours and bury themselves in his clothes.  They’d wait by the door each evening waiting for him to come.  They stopped eating and drinking altogether and had to go to the animal hospital for fluids.  It was awful.  In the end, it turned out the house had too many memories for all of us, so we tore it down and had it rebuilt.  I don’t know whether our dogs still think about my husband now that the house is new and we no longer have his car.  I think they’d go bonkers with joy if they were to see him again, but I don’t think they’re actively grieving anymore.

My Aussie Olive had a favorite chair and it was HERS....when she passed, her sister Xena would go to the chair (which was super comfy btw) and just stare at it for a minute or two and then go to wherever I was (both aussies were Velcro dogs, lol). This went on for about 2 weeks then suddenly one day, Xena just jumped up in Olive’s chair and that was that.  I also believe that Xena knew that Olive was unwell.  They were always very loving towards each other but starting a few days before Olive died, Xena wouldn’t leave her side.  In fact, in addition to Olive first refusing to eat (my first clue something was up), Xena was by her side almost constantly.  When dogs act weird, I call the vet as I did then.  Olive had stomach cancer and passed at home before we could find a mobile vet to do the deed.  Two years later, even though Xena was eating just fine, she started acting strangely and because of the family history, I took her to the vet immediately.  She too had cancer but of the spleen.  I thank heaven I had her for two years after Olive passed.

My doxies did the same thing.  Onslo passed from hemolytic anemia and we had to put him down.  Two years later, Otto got it too.

,How long did you do training with this 10 month old pup before you determined it wasn’t going to help? ,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ivdy6z/neutering_my_golden_retriever_will_it_help_his/#me4t3am,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Neutering is not a quick fix for behaviour unfortunately, and it's not ever guaranteed to fix behaviour at all - in many cases, it can make things worse. 

There's decent research out there which suggests neutered male dogs are *more* prone to aggression and fear/anxiety-based behaviour issues, as well as an increase in over-excitability (which is an extremely common cause of humping behaviours, especially in young dogs). 

Humping, nipping and aggression are all *behaviour* issues at their core, and therefore they are going to require behaviour modification and training regardless of whether you neuter him or not. 

IMO he just sounds like a typical young male dog who hasn't had firm and consistent boundaries and behaviour expectations put in place and enforced. Neutering isn't going to make him suddenly understand what is and isn't acceptable behaviour - that's something that has to be taught. ",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ivdy6z/neutering_my_golden_retriever_will_it_help_his/#me4ua9v,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Neutering is not a guaranteed driver for behavioural change.  Even if it changes behaviour, it might not change the behaviour you want to change. In fact, it may worsen issues your dog is dealing with because you interfere in his hormone system. Neutering in itself isn't a bad thing at all. The purpose of neutering is to prevent a male dog from impregnating female dogs. No more, no less. 

Neutering is a physical intervention. Your dog has behavioural issues. You are more or less guessing that interfering in his hormone balance is going to fix behavioural issues. 

Neutering at such an early age can have serious detrimental effects on the process of becoming a balanced adult dog. More and more the advice is to allow a dog to mature into adulthood before neutering. That ensures the dog receives all the hormonal input it needs to physically and mentally reach adulthood. Neutering to change behaviour should be the ultimate last resort, when behavioural therapy has failed and the only other option is putting down the dog.

The things you are describing sound as a normal, pubescent male dog doing normal, pubescent male dog things. What he needs are clear and consistent rules and boundaries. He needs to learn what behaviour is acceptable and what isn't. 

Neutering isn't going to teach him that. He needs you to teach him. Get help if you don't feel up to the task. Ask trainers, they'll have lots of solid basic advice. Perhaps consult a behavioural therapist if a canine instructor can't help you. If you're going to spend money on his behaviour, spend it on training and education, not on the vet.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ivdy6z/neutering_my_golden_retriever_will_it_help_his/#me5qx0t,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Neutering is always a good idea.  But it's not going to fix inadequate training.  A well trained dog requires intensive effort and then continuous reinforcement.  Training should be fun, and incorporated into every interaction.  Goldens tend to be people pleasers, so somewhat easily trained.  Also, because they want to be with people, don't think you don't need to play or interact with them because you have other dogs.

Good luck.  10 months is firmly in ""butthead"" territory, but still fixable!",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ivdy6z/neutering_my_golden_retriever_will_it_help_his/#me5y2ay,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"getting him neutered may help with his humping issue, but it isn't a fixing solution for behavioural issues. how is he being aggressive towards the other dogs? what behavior is he showing there?
most typically suggest waiting until your dog is fully matured (~2 years) before spaying/neutering, but it is best to discuss that with your personal vet! they will always know what's best for your dog.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ivdy6z/neutering_my_golden_retriever_will_it_help_his/#me4sfxs,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Just want you to know that neutering your dog will take a while for any  behavioral changes because he will still have testosterone in his body for a bit of time.

,"He's likely humping due to anxiety/excitement/over-stimulation. My boy is 2.5 and intact and does not hump. Meanwhile, a neighbor's neutered dog was humping other dogs, and extended family had a spayed female who would hump due to anxiety/stress. I would work on reducing your dog's anxiety levels and slowly building up their threshold in situations that may make them excited/over-stimulated. 

Your dog is also likely reactive, not aggressive. And he's still nipping because 1) he's still a puppy, and 2) you need to redirect better. My boy is a herding breed who herds in part by nipping. I haven't actually had a nipping issue with him since he was maybe 6 months old? He redirects himself to a toy instead when he gets excited and playful. I had a zero tolerance policy for nipping when he was younger. An occasional nip might still happen, but for the most part, I eliminated it early and he learned it wasn't acceptable behavior and that I did not tolerate it. My boy is smart, so he learns quickly, but due to his breed, can also be stubborn. If I can achieve this with a headstrong herding breed, you can too with a Golden, a breed that's known for being biddable.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ivdy6z/neutering_my_golden_retriever_will_it_help_his/#med3tlb,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"There's a technique in dog training that is called ""differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors,"" which is kind of a mouthful lol, but basically it means that you want to train your dog to do something else rather than train him ""not"" to jump. That could mean a lot of things, like for example you can teach your dog to go to ""place"" any time someone arrives at the house and stay there until whoever entered is more settled. It could also be teaching your dog to play a ""find it"" game, which could be tossing a toy on the ground, some kibble, etc. so your dog learns that anytime someone arrives he should look to the ground for the fun stuff! Or it could be as simple as putting him in a sit stay or down stay when people are coming in depending on how good your dog's impulse control is! It might also be useful to take baby steps, like starting training these things on leash at first. Jumping should also never get your dog what he wants, which is attention. Pushing him down or saying ""no"" or looking at him will all make him want to jump more because he got what he was looking for! The best way to deal with him when he does jump is to ignore and turn away, allowing his paws to fall to the ground on their own.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1iwrhw4/my_dog_wont_stop_jumping_on_people_how_do_i_make/#megea4b,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Dog behaviour is really complex and dumbfounding, but it stems from a simple concept of “they do the behaviour, because they get the desired result” if you take out the last part, the first part goes away. 

You are not controlling the greeting ritual. You need to be prepared for all of this, you are armed with this knowledge that **this will happen**. What proactive steps are you taking to prevent it?  Do you have a greeting ritual? Do you have measures in place to prevent it?

I am someone who doesn’t allow dogs to jump on them. Your dog, my dog, every dog,  knows if you want attention from me, you sit your butt on the ground and I will come to you. 

This is a boundary I have. I am allowed to enforce this boundary with the same level of energy that the dog brings, if a dog comes running at me, my leg goes up and my hand goes out. Making it very clear, all you are going to get is a knee in the chest and a palm in the snout.

Now with my own dogs, if they approach someone too fast, they get benched. And the people approach them on their bench, if they get too uppy again the person can step away, but the dog stays on the bench. If the dogs gets off the bench, they are banished to “the room” where they don’t get a greeting, or any engagement till they are calm.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1iwrhw4/my_dog_wont_stop_jumping_on_people_how_do_i_make/#mejnmlt,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Going to go against the grain here. Your dog is jumping because he desperately wants interactions with people. Give him interactions until it becomes boring.

When people arrive, have him at the door with you, bend down to pet him, which will allow you to stop him from jumping, and invite your guests to do the same. Don't force them if they don't want to, of course! But that way dog gets what he wants, people giving him attention, guests don't get jumped on, and you don't have to stress about him jumping on them. Everyone wins!

8 weeks is the minimum that a dog should be separated from it's mom to be adopted, but 10-12 weeks is better.

"Dog sudden behavior change
We are trying to figure out why our dog had a change in personality and became much more hyperactive suddenly about a week ago. We adopted her from the Humane Society a couple months ago and she did very well integrating into the household. About a week ago, we had a party at our house and she came out for a short time. At the same time, it is turning into Spring. The next day, she began pacing a lot in the house, and when she goes outside in the backyard, she no longer plays with our other dog, she runs back-and-forth to each side of the fence whining and looking towards the forest. It’s always worse in the evening, and she does the same thing inside, pacing and looking at the ceiling. We thought she might have a UTI so we treated her for that but she seems to be fine. We’re trying to figure out whether something was triggered during the party that we had, or whether she’s fixated on something happening outside. And what would be the best way to help her? 

Update: I took her to the vet, they ran several tests and it came back normal. They suggested that the party may flared up her anxiety. I went out and got a thunder sweater for her anxiety at nights, and it helped a lot! She’s more mellow and seems happier with the sweater on.

"Can we make breed/age/neutered status required in behavior posts?
Lots of questions about behavior are posted with barebones information. Instead of spending 2/3 comments trying to pry the info out of OP, could we just require the basics like breed/age/neutered status of all dogs upon post submission? For instance, if someone posts the question ""help, my dog is growling and lunging at the mailman"", the answers will change greatly if it's a 13 year old chihuahua vs a 1.5 year old Rottweiler. Same with ""My two dogs have started fighting in the yard"" and they're both 2 year old unfixed cane corso males, vs. male/female cavaliers both fixed 9 years old. Obviously there's a lot more information that should be going into the equation, but it would just make everyone's answers a lot more relevant if we could just start out with choose 3-4 of the most important factors to most behavioral issues.

"Confusing Dog Behavior
My dog, Pepper, is a brown poodle mix. Not sure with what since he was a rescue. He's always had  gentle temperament and likes to chill around, he's a nice pup. However, today he found a baby chicken in our garden. He dug a hole around it and lay down with it, presumably to protect it. We let them have a few more minutes but had to move the chick to one of our birdcages to provide it with food and water and a safer shelter for rest. He seemed very upset about us moving it.

Later on in the day, we took the chick out to check how it was doing and to let Pepper see it in person again. However, he was sniffing it a lot and then did something strange. He seemed to shove it violently and it seemed like he was going for it's legs? I couldn't clearly see his face so I'm not sure if he was going in for a bite. I quickly put the chick back and Pepper was again distressed. 

I'm very confused about this switch in behavior as I thought he cared for the chick? Any advice?",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1innht7/confusing_dog_behavior/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"How to deal with unwanted behaviors while using a flexi leash?
I'm in need of some guidance. My 10-month-old Samoyed, who's usually well-behaved on walks, faced a shift recently. During her first heat, I switched to a flexi leash to give her more freedom while still maintaining structured walks. Before that all of our walks have: structured walk + lots of sniff time + off leash play time. Now that her heat is ending, transitioning back to a regular leash has brought about some challenges. When I give her the cue to sniff freely, she pulls on the leash, expecting more space. Additionally, her focus on the heel has diminished a bit, though she attempts to comply because whenever she breaks it I stop and do not move until she returns back in the heel position. She doesn't like when we stop walking, that's the main reason why she does her best to respect the heel. I need her to heel because he had in the past lots of problems with bicycles on our walks.  
Is it worth walking your dog on a flexi leash in green areas? To me, it clearly has some advantages but seeing that her behavior changed makes me wonder if it's worth it. Even if we go for a hike and use a flexi leash she would pull once she hits the end of it.  
Please correct me if I'm wrong: I live in a city and I have in mind that the dog is not getting enough by walking on a short leash, even if our walks last for 30-60 min. In my opinion, the dog should be off leash at least once a day to run and explore freely (in park). Is this realistic? I would like to go running with my dog but can't due to a knee injury.  
Do you use flexi leashes? and where?",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1bakkdh/how_to_deal_with_unwanted_behaviors_while_using_a/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Flexi leashes are pretty unpopular on this sub, just a head’s up. They can lead to a lot of problems—the things you’ve mentioned along with rope burns, cuts, finger amputations. They can also scare the dog if you drop the leash as the plastic handle quickly retracts and “chases” them. If they jerk to a stop suddenly at the end, that can cause neck injuries. I don’t use one for these reasons, even though they seem really convenient and I wish I could look past the issues. 

When I adopted my dog, he was used to a flexi leash. It just took a while of practice and reinforcing good leash behavior with treats. 

If I were you, I’d just switch to a long line when you get to a place where you want to give your dog more freedom.

,"Another reason why flexi leashes are bad: they ruin the pressure communication with the dog because the dog gets used to the leash being ""taught"" or ""tight"" at all times.

It sounds like your dog still reacts badly to elements of the walk (ie bicycles), so a regular leash would probably be best if you expect to encounter any.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1bakkdh/how_to_deal_with_unwanted_behaviors_while_using_a/#ku36933,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your dog has to have a really good understanding of leash manners before using a flexi leash. I use one with mine. We have strict leash rules and there only so many places I can let him off lead. 

You need to be able to recall at anytime and put in a heel on command. Ours is if we see people or other dogs he comes back to a heel until I free him. When he's not on that lead, he knows to stay with me in a focused heel. Mostly, that is only at stores. He also checks in regularly and will choose to walk by me so he's not at the end constantly. 

So you need to go back to the basic leash manners. Make sure she has a very good understanding before going to the flexi leash.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1bakkdh/how_to_deal_with_unwanted_behaviors_while_using_a/#ku3kjmf,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I use a flexi for certain things. Like all tools, it can be used correctly or incorrectly, appropriately or inappropriately. Plenty of highly skilled professional trainers incorporate flexis into their training with sports and police working dogs, they're not traumatising dogs or losing fingers on the reg.  

I don't use one for ""normal"" daily walks though, only for certain training applications in controlled environments or walking/toileting the dogs at dog shows or trials. 

Have you trained the dog to understand leash pressure (like when they reach the end of a leash, be that a standard or flexi) means ""immediately turn back around and return to the owner for reinforcement"" rather than ""keep pulling""? That can help. If your leash is a flexi brand you can also use the ""click click click click click"" noise that happens when you half-depress the ""brake"" button while the dog is pulling/extending the flexi leash as a marker that predicts the pressure that happens when you fully depress the brake button; you can then condition that sound to serve as a cue to recall to you. 

The loss of focus during the heel could be related to the flexi or it could just be that the dog's going through a major teenage shift hormonally and therefore the environment is currently a more interesting/reinforcing stimulus than you are. Not uncommon for dogs at this age. Go back to basics with lots of reinforcement for heel position; make it fun and energetic to keep the dog engaged. Reinforcing the dog strongly in heel position is going to work faster than only punishing when she breaks the heel. ",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1bakkdh/how_to_deal_with_unwanted_behaviors_while_using_a/#ku4ud9t,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Almost immediate post neutering behavior change
We have a street dog we adopted since he was a very young puppy and recently neutered him (male, 15 months, 22kg). We’re 2 days out and while his energy (he wants to run, jump etc even though we have to restrain him) and appetite have returned to normal he isn’t interested in any toy or play. He’s usually a dog that’s *obsessed* with balls and squeaky toys. 

I know I’m probably just being paranoid but I’m really concerned at his disinterest. Is this normal?

Hi everyone, new to this so delete if I get anything wrong please!

My 2 year old boxer sneezes a ton when we let him sniff my 8 month old, wiggles, chases his tail and does some shake offs but always comes back for more interaction when we allow it. Their time “together” is always limited and with heavy supervision it I mostly just wanted to make sure my gut instinct that he is happy and playful with the interactions is correct? He’s been around small kids (safely) since he was a pup, but this is his first baby. Thank you all!

"Reminder that your dog's behavior and what they would or 'would never' do depends on the current context and situation
I don't consider my dog to be aggressive towards other dogs. I still don't. But before last night, I would not have considered my dog to be *dangerous* for other dogs. I would have said that she would never lunge for another dog or treat them as prey. And I have discovered that that was wrong.

Last night I took my dog out for her last potty break directly before bed, at like 10pm. We take a lap around our building. A woman with a little teacup/toy Yorkie also lives in our building. The two dogs have walked past each other dozens of times without any issue, except for the Yorkie yapping at my dog.

Let me reiterate - my dog has encountered the Yorkie many times before, and never given her a second glance, regardless of the Yorkie's behavior.

But every other time the dogs have seen each other has been in daytime. Last night when my dog spotted the Yorkie across the street, she did the exact same ""freeze-whine-dance"" that she does when she spots a squirrel or a rabbit. I realized what was happening right before she lunged. I had a good grip on the leash, so she never got away from me, and I quickly lead her away. She never even got into the street, but I was shocked that she would even do that!

Once I thought about it, I understood why she did it. The Yorkie is about the same size and color as the wild rabbits that live in our neighborhood. And my dog has *only* ever encountered those rabbits *at night*. And she has *only* encountered the Yorkie *in the day*. Therefore, the thing across the street was not the Yorkie, it was obviously a rabbit! So she tried to chase it and kill it as she normally would.

I wanted to share this story as a reminder to everyone that your dog is not a human. They do not have human intelligence, they do not have human eyesight, and they don't think like a human does. A human can understand that a dog that's usually only seen in daylight may still go out at night. A dog can't predict that, they can only compare that dog to something they've encountered before at night - a rabbit. They don't have the fine detail and color vision that we do, so they can't tell the difference between a small dog and a rabbit without being able to smell it.

It was just a case of mistaken identity, not aggression. But if my dog had gotten loose and gotten to the Yorkie, the Yorkie would probably be dead.

Never let yourself get complacent about what your dog would or wouldn't do. Keep track of what situations are new to your dog, and maintain greater control in those situations. And think about ***why*** they're happening. It would be easy to dismiss my dog as being dog-aggressive when she's not. She's just got high prey drive, and now I know that its not safe to have her around very small dogs at night.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/px8f1z/reminder_that_your_dogs_behavior_and_what_they/,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can say your dog would ‘never’ in regards to a lot of things, but the only certainty you ever have is that you will never be certain what a dog may or may not do under specific conditions and scenarios.

Your dog could bolt across the street to get to a cat or a squirrel and then be hit by a car regardless of what you’re recall command is even though it’s never shown interest in small animals prior.

He was also horribly dog reactive when I got him. He was 18months and just untrained in general. 

It took me years of consistency to get him to be able to walk past other dogs without wanting to eat them. We did ok introducing him to our other dogs, but they had to be female. No boys. 

When we first had him, people would want to introduce their dogs to him all the time, and wouldn’t believe he was an asshole coz he was such a sweet looking boy.

"[Discussion] People need to learn dog behavior
So another post reminded me of this and I just wanted to share it....basically, I work at a no kill shelter that pulls dogs from high kill shelters that are going to be euthanized. One of them was this beautiful pit husky mix that was the sweetest thing. Why was it going to be put down? Because it was “too aggressive” and “snarled and bared her teeth” whenever a human approached. Clearly super human aggressive, right? Even the kill shelter staff swore by it.

Well, they were dead wrong. That “snarling” was her smiling in her own doggy way, she did it whenever she got super excited and would start wagging her tail, and if you sat next to her or tried to let her sniff you, she’d immediately get so excited that her teeth would come out full force and she’d fall over begging for belly rubs.

I’m sorry for this rant thing, but it frustrates me that people, especially people who work with animals, don’t even bother to learn dog behavior. This dog was going to be out down in days without even a chance to get a home just because everyone decided she was too aggressive.",,,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/dzjt7v/discussion_people_need_to_learn_dog_behavior/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I really wish those in contact with dogs, from owners to outdated trainers, would really take their time to study rather than watching a few wannabe dog whisperer videos and calling it a day.

There are so many times when a dog bites/growls and people exclaim “It came out of nowhere! He needs to be put down now.” No, the dog has been showing signs of distress and discomfort for a very long time and it’s been completely ignored. Whether it’s because someone used force and cornered them wanting to be a so called “pack leader” or because someone let their child annoy them to no end; dogs can only take so much.

For those who just want a place to start look up Dr. Kendal Shepherd’s canine studies and her canine ladder of aggression. Well studied behaviorists provide so much insight.

Edit: For those who look up the chart, just wanted to mention not all dogs exhibit each sign in order. A dog may skip from ‘crouched and ears back’ to immediate ‘biting.’ This is because misinformed owners will get belligerent and mad when their dogs growl, so dogs will fear punishment, skip it, and go directly to biting. This is why behaviorists will tell owners NOT to punish dogs for growling to avoid going up to full on aggression.",,https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/dzjt7v/discussion_people_need_to_learn_dog_behavior/#f8825kn,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My husband hates the dog and I'm wondering if I should rehome her?
My husband hates, actually, absolutely loathes, the dog he INSISTED we bring home. I wish I was kidding when I saw he says ""I hate that f'ing dog."" at least 10 times a day. 

She is a 1 year old Border Collie Mix and she is terrified of my husband. Every time he enters a room she tenses up, and he relishes in it. He acts like he loves the fact that she fears him and will spout of lines about how he's the alpha and she knows it. 

The problem is fear breeds aggression and I've seen her nip at our 3 and 1 year old. I do my due diligence and supervise my children, and provide the dog a calm space when I am home, but when my husband is home I know he just locks her up because he doesn't want to deal with her. 

I don't know what to do - I don't want to remove her from the only home she's really known and I don't want her to become a shelter dog, but I want her to be in a home where she can thrive. What is the best choice here?

ETA: First, thank you to everyone for responding. To the many ""Rehome the Husband"" comments, divorce is definitely being considered, but the situation is complicated. That's all I can add for now, thank you again.

"Understanding how genetics influence the behavior of your pet dog
I am often left stunned when I am on certain dog groups to hear so-called experts telling people the way a dog is behaving is all about how they are being handled and the environment the dog was raised in and is now in.

When the clear facts are that genetics plays a huge part in the way a dog responds to different situations and environments no matter how they are handled.

The same 'experts' may well go on to say something like being a herding dog you may need to do such and such to give them an outlet for that behavior. Do they not hear themselves, 1 minute it's all about environmental factors then the next they are addressing the genetic input the dog's breeding has on their behaviors.

Excuse me but you can not have it both ways, when in fact the truth is your dog is born with a certain mix of genetic traits and the dominant traits will most definitely affect how it reacts but you can use environmental conditioning and management to shape those traits into a more acceptable pet to suit your needs.

But in my honest opinion be honest with yourself about what you need and expect of a pet dog then make an educated decision on what breed holds the best genetic likelihood of fitting into your lifestyle and you are much more likely to be happy about the day to day of being a dog owner.

,"Dogs were domesticated at least 14,000 years ago.  Since then, humans have controlled breeding to produce dogs for different jobs.

These are hard wired characteristics based on hundreds and thousands of years of selective breeding.  You might be able to somewhat tamp down a hard wired proclivity, but you can’t change it.

Now it's not a 💯 that a certain breed will have a certain temperament, but it is a factor. Nurture will not overpower Nature with animals. 

Choosing a pet because of looks without researching the breed or breeds can set you up for failure. 

I chose a beagle because I wanted a high energy dog, but in a smaller package that would be good traveling with me. That's exactly what I got. Indiana Bones loves long walks (with many many sniff breaks) and he's on his way to learning to be a good hiking/travel dog as he hits his one year mark. Training has been good, he's got a couple basic commands down, were just working on better leash manners and heading off some low food guarding (he barks at the cat when it tries to steal his food while eating) 

For a second dog, maybe in a year or two, were leading with either another beagle or a golden retriever, based again on temperament and energy levels.

"Does anyone else get super proud when the vet comments on your dogs behavior?
My dogs got no regard for his body, so we're at the vet and in hospitals a lot. He's a spaz and always getting hurt. He's got long legs and can't always use them kindly ha. I am always finding something weird on him. He also has terrible GI issues, so we're in and out of different Vets and Hospitals A LOT.

Anyway, no matter where we go the first thing I always hear is, 'YOUR DOG IS SO SWEET AND WELL BEHAVED HE'S SO CUTE AND ALL THE STAFF LOVES HIM.' Just recently we saw an Internist and I am reading the write up and the Dr. mentions how he's such a sweet boy.

It's so nice to hear all the time and I am so oddly proud that my dog is such a sweet boy. I mean he is a sweet boy. He's insane, he's a JRT, so he's insane, but he's so sweet. I am just so proud to be his mom.

"My dog won't let my partner sleep in our bed.
Our 11 year old rescue, who we've had for about 8.5 years, has slept between our pillows pretty much every night. But in early May he started panicking at night, silently but inconsolably, apparently in response to my partner sleeping. He stands over her panting and saucer-eyed, and if that doesn't wake her up he paws at her head. When she's awake, he'll fall peacefully back to sleep, but when she drifts off again he'll wake up and repeat.

He's unresponsive to my attempts to calm or console him. He breaks free of any attempt to physically separate or restrain him. We took him to the vet to rule out physical pain, and his blood and urine tests were normal. We've given him various sedatives that only make him dopier while he's doing this.

The only two things that have any real impact are:
1. If I take him out and sleep in another room with him, he'll sleep soundly.
2. If my partner leaves and sleeps in another room, he'll sleep soundly with me in our bed.
We hope this indicates that it's not dementia/CCD because in her absence he sleeps normally.

My partner doesn't snore or do anything weird in sleep to explain this. Again, they've been sleeping in the same bed for more than eight years.

In April we took him on a 10-day road trip, and at the end of that my partner returned home with him and I stayed away for three more weeks. This behavior started when I was away, so we assumed my absence was the cause. But I've been back for five weeks now with no change or improvement. 

He's crate trained– he loves his crate and will happily trot in there from anywhere in the house when we need to leave (which used to be daily for work but has become far less frequent since the pandemic started). He's never slept in there overnight, and if we crate him amidst these bizarre panicking sessions he paws at the door to get out. Since we don't want him to have negative associations with his crate, we let him out–though maybe with proper training his crate could be a useful tool in solving this? We just don't see a clear method.

He's a clingy and nervous 28lb Chihuahua mix, and he absolutely adores my partner under every other circumstance.

We're totally at a loss. We'd like to sleep in the same bed again. Anyone ever heard of this? Any ideas about how to fix?",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/vfxeuh/my_dog_wont_let_my_partner_sleep_in_our_bed/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"How to get my geriatric dog to quiet down!
This year, my 15 year old lab developed a terrible barking habit, which is especially bad from 5-8am. She clearly does it to get someone to come to her for help. For instance, her eyes are bad, so she likes someone to walk up the stairs with her as a guide for how big the steps are. But she likes to wander, and we have lots of stairs, so you can imagine the barking is fairly incessant. She also barks when she wants to go outside, have a treat, get up on a couch, etc. It has been negatively impacting everyone’s sleep and stress levels. Any tips for getting her to be quiet?",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/101fw6r/how_to_get_my_geriatric_dog_to_quiet_down/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I agree that its time to reduce the areas of the house that  they are allowed in. Close her in the bedroom of whoever is up earliest, or with someone in the house that doesn't work etc so they can wake up and handle her.

Ultimately she's communicating that she needs help to do something that she can't do on her own, so you can either give her other options that she can do on her own (and remove the old options) or control her locations and respond to her requests in a controlled manner.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/101fw6r/how_to_get_my_geriatric_dog_to_quiet_down/#j2n7dq4,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Poor baby, aging is hard!! 

She’s using her bark to communicate
with you- that’s a VERY GOOD DOG!

Try to be understanding instead of frustrated. When you’re old, you’ll hope that someone is empathetic to your needs too!!! 

It’s possible that she’s starting to get confused at night. Keep her in a smaller area when you go to bed. If it were me, I would keep her in my bedroom with me so that I could run her outside if needed! 

A nightlight might also help her to be less confused in the dark. As her sight changes, her night vision will likely continue to be effected!

Start taking her outside more frequently, like when she was a puppy. With age, it becomes harder to wait for a bathroom! Her bathroom barks could be a sign of increased need/urgency, so being proactive will cut out some barking. I cannot stress enough WHAT A GOOD GIRL this is- she could be peeing on your floor, but instead she’s communicating!

Consider a vet visit to rule out any new pain, or other treatable symptoms. 

Please never forget that at 15, it’s hard to know how much time you’ll have left with your friend. PLEASE love her and be patient while she’s in this period- she’s given you 15 years of unconditional love, and deserves nothing but the best in return ❤️",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/101fw6r/how_to_get_my_geriatric_dog_to_quiet_down/#j2oqg02,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Have more empathy for her situation, instead of just focusing on the fact that she's barking and that annoys you. She can't see well and probably can't hear well either. Most dogs of this size have some degree of painful arthritis by this age, and it wouldn't be surprising at all if she has some level of doggy dementia.

Talk to your vet about use of medication to deal with a possible dementia issue. Have her evaluated for arthritic pain and discuss whether an anti-inflammatory would be a good idea.

Have her sleep overnight in a room with another family member so that she doesn't need to wander or have access to stairs on her own.

Make sure she has a thick, memory foam bed (with a bolster if she likes to curl up against something) in the rooms where you hang out with her (or where she sleeps) so that she doesn't need to get up on the couch or sleep on a surface that might cause her pain.

Consider that someone may need to get up and let her out as soon as she wakes up because she may be losing bladder or bowel control, and that's a very humiliating thing for most dogs. Yes that might be 5:00 a.m., but it is what it is. Get her out for a final potty trip right before the last person goes to bed, even if she's already asleep.

The reality is that you are basically living with a 95-year-old grandma, and that comes with the expectation that the family will need to provide an increased level of care. Think about how much care you had to provide for the dog when she was a puppy, and now it's time to do that again.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/101fw6r/how_to_get_my_geriatric_dog_to_quiet_down/#j2nzfbt,,,,,,,,,,,,

It worked really well, but I tried not to use it too often because I wanted to monitor his regular behavior since any changes mean something is going on.
So that may be something you find helpful? Natural calming treats as a first step? Or maybe keeping your dog with you at night so he's comforted by your presence?",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/101fw6r/how_to_get_my_geriatric_dog_to_quiet_down/#j2n6qb3,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I need help with a dog who has an extremely high prey drive with a major lack of impulse control
For starters, I am a dog trainer. I've been in the field for nearly 10 years and have never seen a dog quite like this one. Gir, is a frenchie/pit mix who is roughly 9m old. He has come such a long way when it comes to walking on leash, leave it, waiting at doors, focus work, etc. so he has definitely shown some improvement in his impulse control. The problem comes in when the kids have any kind of balls on the trampoline. On leash, he will easily leave them alone and not try to get them. Full slack and waiting patiently. Off leash, is a completely different story. He will jump underneath the trampoline and pop the ball into the air continuously until we are finally able to pull him away. He will not stop on his own and can get snappy when you are trying to get him to come out because he is in a heightened state of arousal or over stimulated. When I can finally get him out, he will have abrasions on his nose, cuts on his tongue, and he will easily walk away and drop into a down because he's beyond exhausted. I've talked to a vet who doesn't think it's any form of OCD or CCD. I'm pretty sure the reason why he is doing it is because he essentially can't fulfill his need to catch the ball, each time he goes for it, it pops and goes to a new spot, thus restarting the cycle. I can't figure out what I can do to help work with him more than he has already learned. I even had him on a 20ft leash and he was great, wouldn't even try, but the second the leash is off, he is 100% unreliable in any kind of recall or leave it. 

We've done hand targeting to help his recall, we've done Leave It extensively on and off leash and he is around 90% reliable outside of this situation. He understands his cues for going inside, to settle, and so on, but I have hit a wall with this one. I would love any recommendations you can give, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels trying to figure this out and I don't have any other trainers in the area to brainstorm with. 

TLDR: Dog has a high prey drive when it can't fulfill it's need to catch the prey, outside of that is strongly reliable in other commands on and off leash.

I think it is straight on overarousal and if you cannot interrupt it without redirection it's pretty damn sure close to being obsessive.

How is he around other animals?
What sort of rest/calming work does he get? Mental Stimulation?

Honestly. If he is so well trained in the other situations you mentioned but off leash is so problematic I would be concerned about extreme animal aggression, not necessarily predation. 

I would recommend a vet behaviour specialist VB and consider adding meds to the training program.

"Trialing advice needed
absolutely flunked our first CCD trial today, i didn’t expect to pass on our first trial but i never predicted this mess. We failed the heeling and stand for exam. Our recall was amazing but it didn’t matter as we had already lost all points. sit stay went ok but the down stay went terribly, the ground was wet and no matter what i did i could not get Finn to drop down. Seeing as i already failed the judge said to just leave him in a sit, as i walked away and turned around he had stood up, and a few seconds in he ran out of the ring to a person he knew, that had food. i am so embarrassed, 2 years of training, training, training and building a bond with him just for it to end up like this.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ygy8bu/trialing_advice_needed/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"> am so embarrassed, 2 years of training, training, training and building a bond with him just for it to end up like this.

Don't let one bad day ruin two years of work. So your dog had a bad day? So what? The point of dog sports should be the bond and fun you have with your dog on an ongoing basis, the ribbons are just a nice bonus. Do you have a good life with your dog on a daily basis? Do you have fun working with them? Are they having fun? That is what should matter here.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ygy8bu/trialing_advice_needed/#iubttvi,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"First off, regardless of our expectations, the important spectators we’ve invited, or the money spent on entries/training/travel: on any given day your dog might just be a dog. This means nothing about the bond between you. Just means today, your dog was a dog. 

Anyone and everyone that is involved in trials has not only witnessed many, many dogs being “just a dog” on any day, but has experienced something similar themselves. I have *never* heard a judge or competitor saying anything like “wow yesterday we had an absolutely awful, untrained dog and a handler that shouldn’t have bothered” - instead, if they even remember, the story would go “oh they put so much effort into training I hope they try again” or even “oh, that handler lost the dog’s attention for the heel but their recall was outstanding”. 

Nobody but you remembers the messes. Literally. Even the dog doesn’t remember (or care). Focus on the positives (this is about *having fun with the dog, remember??*), think about how to improve what didn’t work, and try again. If the heel was a disaster, you might try Rally-O, where you can talk to the dog.  No matter where you practise, the competition ring is a weirdly scary place- it can have lots of distractions and you’re under crazy stress that the dog can sense. Rally-O is on lead, and might be less stressful as the scoring should be a bit more forgiving. 


Also, huge congrats on the recall! We have failed many (many, Many, MANY) trials and many times we’ve failed the recall, so I know how much work you put into that!!

Ps. Our longest streak was SEVEN straight trials where we walked into a ring, I unleashed my dog, judge asked “are you ready”, I said yes, we were told to heel forward and on the first step my dog got up…turned around…and walked out of the ring. SEVEN TIMES IN A ROW. And eventually yes one trial we passed!!! I know some teams had an easier time, but I felt like we really truly EARNED that title and wouldn’t change the journey.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ygy8bu/trialing_advice_needed/#iuc6yl0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m sure there’s plenty of practical advice you could get for how to improve your dog’s performance. But it sounds like you may be more distressed about doing poorly in competition than about your dog’s general obedience.

,"Your dog doesn't know this was a competition. To your dog it's just life, and you two were engaging together the way you normally do, except you were tense and some other things around were different and he just wasn't feeling it for some parts.  

It might help to consider alternative dog sports such as doggy dancing, simply as a thought exercise - imagine you're going to do a doggy dancing routine, and you're going to choreograph it for friends, and your friends can call out what order to do the fancy new tricks you've taught in. But because of the nature of the tricks, that probably feels more like playing silly games with your dog where you both know the rules, compared to obedience trialling, doesn't it? However, from the dog's perspective, there's literally no difference: a trick is just a cue which prompts a consistent, practiced behaviour. Slapping a ""CCD exercise"" label on a behaviour doesn't make it any less a trick or a game. So, if your mindset is is more stressed about the experience than it would be if you were doing a fun tricks routine together, that should be food for thought.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ygy8bu/trialing_advice_needed/#iullbti,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Senior dog with health issues- constant pacing
Hey all!

My 14yo boxer mix’s health has been declining fairly rapidly over the past few months. He has his good days and bad days and we are taking everything one day at a time. Most recently, he has been observed aimlessly wandering and pacing around the house just panting and staring off into space. We are attempting to manage his pain as best as possible with medication and keeping him comfortable. Lots of treats and love and attention. I am realistic about the situation and understand that he is old and the combination of slowly losing his vision and hearing as well as arthritis and dementia is challenging and probably terrifying for him. His ratio of good days to bad days is still good, I don’t think his quality of life has diminished to the point of needing to make a decision, but my family and I are mentally prepared for that for when the time feels right. Does anyone have any recommendations on how we can attempt to redirect the pacing behavior and try to reduce any discomfort and anxiety he is experiencing?

"Is canine compulsive disorder the owner's fault?
My adolescent dog's trainer thinks she might be staying to show signs of CCD and my worry is I've caused this somehow. Can you shed any light?

She's 11 months old, border collie. I'm worried by articles I've read that talk about the dog not getting enough stimulation or enrichment as I've always worried that I'm not doing enough. Usually we do about 90 minutes exercise (1 hour on lead and half hour off lead, playing a herding game together), we do scentwork and games of tug if she's bored at home. We don't do as much formal training as we used to in terms of tricks etc because we use most of her patience on desensitisation/counter conditioning because she has so many triggers. I work at home so I'm here all day, although I typically work in another room, otherwise I'll get nothing done!

I'm worried that:

- this means she does spend eight hours a day alone, even though I'm in the house with her. She mostly sleeps through this time but could this be an issue?

- she doesn't get as much off lead time as I'd like at the moment because she has an extremely high herding drive and most situations are too risky (any movement will trigger her, including people walking by). 

- my sleeping pattern is not great which means we don't stick to a strict routine, especially on the weekend if I sleep in. Could this affect her?


She'll be training to work sheep in about seven weeks' time, and once she's definitely physically mature we'll also be doing canni cross as this is a safer way I can ensure she gets a good run. Could this help her?",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/sbi94w/is_canine_compulsive_disorder_the_owners_fault/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Don't allow a trainer to even mention this unless they're actually certified and have a long history of working with dogs. If this trainer suspects this, they should be referring you to a veterinary behaviorist for the medication necessary to manage it. 

You may be doing too much exercise. I have a shiba and a doberman, both of whom are higher drive. The goal is not entertaining them, but helping them learn to settle down.

"Our Springer Spaniel's compulsive disorder is worsening. I would love any experiences you can share about training dogs with this condition as well as tips on exercising your dog on leash and running with your dog.
We got our Springer Spaniel when he was a year and 2 months and have now had him for seven months. We didn't know about his condition before we adopted him. We live in an apartment but have a large park nearby that we walk him in for at least 1.5 hours a day. We also used to do gun dog training there until his condition no longer allowed the required focus. His leash walking was terrible when he first got here and we have managed to improve it a lot, however he still lounges at birds and as his condition is deteriorating so his his leash walking. We take him out for a half hour leash walk a day to practice. My boyfriends previous dog was a field trial champion gun dog and we currently have a wonderful cocker spaniel bitch that we also do gun dog training with so we are by no means inexperienced dog owners.

His compulsive behavior is staring at walls and panting indoors even when there are no shadows to chase and outside he has outbursts of chasing either the shadow of his own ears or nothing at all. It makes it impossible to get reliable recall. We try to interrupt this behavior at all times. My boyfriend works from home and I study online so we are around most of the time. Inside this is very annoying and disruptive to anything we may be doing as he will randomly jump up and stare at the wall  but it is possible. I am currently trialling tethering him to me (attaching the leash to my waist) so I can get some work done and it seems to be working ok. Outside we have tried managing him with a long leash, however he is very fast and if he manages to slip away he gets tangled in the trees and gets very distressed and over threshold. His condition is continuously worsening. I don't know for how much longer we can keep trying. I am exhausted and feel like crying after every walk.

We have gotten help from a behaviourist. He said we were likely overtraining him with the gun dog training which was making him stressed out and increasing his obsessive behavior so we cut this out. He also said we should try to make every walk a ""good walk"" without him freaking out. As his chasing behavior outside has gotten worse we have had to restrict him to on leash walking to manage his condition as well as fetch and recall training in our buildings tiny fenced dog park. This doesn't seem like nearly enough exercise for a springer spaniel and the pulling that still occurs of walks is causing me constant shoulder pain. I am afraid lack of exercise will worsen his condition. I am trying to fit in training sessions on settle and renew his recall training indoors and in the dog park. If I can get his leash walking a bit better I may be able to take him to walk in the park instead of by the road so nature doesn't become even more exciting. I would also love to take him running. However, I am not sure how to get him to not pull without having to correct all the time. Also, running seems to excite him and increase his pulling. We are currently trying him on mementadine but it doesn't seem to be working. The next step will be selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors. However our behaviourist wants to do neurological tests, orthopaedic exams of his legs and eye tests before we can try them which will take months. I don't know if I can hold on for that long. The insurance is treating this as a pre-existing condition and isn't paying so all these tests will cost us thousands of pounds. He is also really afraid of the vets at this point because we have to keep bringing him so he has special meds to take on days he has to go to the vet. However, they don't seem to be working. We will try to convince them to let us try the SSRIs without all these tests.

I am looking for any advice from people that have experience with compulsive disorders in dogs from a training or medication perspective. Does it ever get better? I am so tired. Please don't bring up that ""It's me or the dog!"" episode. I have seen it and I wish any of it worked for us. Any suggestions on providing sufficient exercise and mental stimulation without stressing him out would also be greatly appreciated. If you have dogs with different behavioural issues, what management techniques do you use? Also, do any of you run with your dogs on lead? How did you get them not to pull?",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/s7x8br/our_springer_spaniels_compulsive_disorder_is/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I am honestly surprised your behaviourist wants to do those longer tests prior to the SSRIs - I was under the impression that the medications are [first in line treatment](https://www.vin.com/apputil/content/defaultadv1.aspx?pId=14365&catId=73675&id=7259303) for these conditions. Is this a veterinary behaviourist you are working with? 

I would reach out to organisations/clinics that have specific experience in compulsive disorders in dogs, maybe call up a few universities near you that have a veterinary science faculty and ask if they can refer to someone who has specialised in CCD that can work in conjunction with your current vet. It may also be worth a look for rescues and charities that specialise in deaf/blind dogs (such as double merles) as these dogs are more likely to develop CCD and so they are likely to know who is out there in your country with experience in this. Also be warned I've seen the rise of people promoting bullshit like homeopathy and Bach flower drops for this condition while claiming themselves to be experts, so unfortunately a bit of skepticism is warranted as you go.  

For the pulling, our wiki article on [calmness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/calm) has a link at the bottom called ""stop walking your dog"" that will likely be of help to you. I would channel this dog's energy into lots and lots of [scentwork](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/scentwork) at home to keep him occupied. I would also avoid [NILIF](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/nilif) type training as it can increase frustration and link the compulsive behaviour to new triggers more easily in these dogs.

"Puppy with strange behaviours
My 7 MO springer spaniel Aussie is the best boy. Been fully potty trained/cage trained/ boot trained for a few months. Very excitable but that’s expected

He does however, have some very annoying quirks that nobody else seems to understand…

Firstly he started out tail chasing if we didn’t show him enough attention - and reading oblong and In various subs this is a CCD behaviour that NEEDS to be stopped. And so, we change his routine to suit him (walk first thing then feed instead of the other way round) then also distracted by hiding treats around the room etc.

Now his tail chasing has disappeared (almost completely) he’s decided to start chasing shadows and small reflections of light to the point where he will whine as he gets too frustrated… everywhere says adjust the environment accordingly… so in the front room we simply CANNOT open the curtains, can’t have the big light on, and can’t have any lights on in the kitchen whilst he’s in there.

I get so stressed out when he’s doing these odd behaviours and not sure anybody else understands… is it just a phase? Did I simply choose the puppy of the litter that has CCD? 

I don’t know anymore and I feel like I’m doing something wrong even though I’m following the rule books to the letter (correct length of walks/fetch/mental stimulation games/training).

Rant over…

"Old, blind dog refuses to be inside any enclosure
My 16 year old blind Chihuahua was crate trained pretty much her entire life, but now in her old age and blind I cannot even put her in a 3'x3' pen (she's small, only 5 lbs) without her barking up a storm and having a panic attack and barking up a storm, pacing to the point her paw are raw and bleed.

"[Help] Extreme ball obsession and fixation in recently adopted 8-month-old
Hello

I'm writing this on behalf of my parents, a couple in their late-60s with well over 50 years of dog owning experience. They have owned many breeds and their last dog was a rescue who had been physically and psychologically abused and required a large amount of rehabilitation, so they have experience with difficult situations.

They recently adopted an 8-month-old Miniature Bull Terrier. He came from a first-time breeder who had owned MBTs for many years. From the litter of 3 females/2 males, the breeder decided to sell the females and keep the two males as pets. At 4 months the two males began fighting and had to be kept separated. He was neutered at 6 months. My family adopted him a few weeks ago as the breeder felt she could not give him enough attention due to the fact he was aggressive towards his brother. She claims he was never aggressive towards other dogs.

The dog has a severe obsession with balls and ball chewing that my parents have not been able to help him with. He behaved with extreme aggression towards the family cat when my mother brought her into the house one evening, and he bit my father on the arm when he was attempting to subdue him.

The dog's entire universe is the ball. If he does not have it in his possession, he searches for it. If he comes inside without it, he spends all his time looking out the door at it. If he comes inside with it, he chews it non-stop while panting heavily.

It's difficult to get him to come inside without it, but my parents are very patient and are getting him to drop it outside before coming in - but sometimes this takes a VERY long time.

My parents are also very concerned by an aggressive or ""attack"" stance he has begun adopting towards them when he is in the yard with the ball. When they approach him, instead of wagging his tail and greeting them, he lowers his posture and looks up at them with a cold look, his eyes darting back and forth between the ball and them.

However, he is not protective of the ball per say. He does not growl when they touch or take it. He is very demanding about playing fetch: he brings the ball to them and roughly puts it in their lap or puts it down and nudges it towards them. He is fine sleeping in his crate at night without it, and does not whine or bark when crated.

The dog appears to have severe anxiety. He chews on the ball compulsively and pants heavily when he has it. He just isn't very interested in anything else apart from the ball. My family believe he was left outside for long periods of time by himself and he is not properly socialised with both humans and other dogs.

The biting incident is what has prompted me to post this. The dog lunged aggressively and went into a frenzy when he saw the cat inside the house. My father could not control him or get him to stop, and when he grabbed him by his collar, he turned around and bit him fairly badly on his forearm. No stitches but a nasty bite. If he had caught the cat, he would have killed it without question.

They are getting close to their wits end. I'd really appreciate any strategies for dealing with his ball obsession, and for helping him with what appears to be anxiety/compulsive chewing on it. They are really fond of him, but the bite has changed things and they need to either start making more progress with him or take him back to the breeder.

,"What about taking away the ball completely? Perhaps replacing it with other activities that require endurance and mental stimulation? Such as runs, agility, teaching him tricks, etc. 
I would also muzzle him in public places. I am glad your parents gave him a chance. He sounds like he needs one! Good luck!",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/4sj5yu/help_extreme_ball_obsession_and_fixation_in/#d59voot,,,,,,,,,,,,

This stance is pretty standard for a ball-obsessed dog; both my Sheltie and Briard do it. I joke that they're mentally willing us to throw it... ""it's right here, right here, right here, do you see where I'm looking?""

edited to add: [is it staring sort of like this video, except looking back and forth between the person and wherever the ball is?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOCKiOWUptM&t=0m50s)

Does he obsess over anything OTHER than the ball? I understand that he searches for the ball when it is taken away, but what if they did not return it to him and didn't keep a ball in the house? 

Both of my dogs love tennis balls more than anything. They will do nothing but obsess over the balls. Frisbees, squeaky toys, rope toys... they love that stuff too, but the tennis ball is some next level shit. We can keep plenty of toys around the house, but tennis balls are not among them.  Letting them carry around a ball encourages the fixation.

**How much exercise does he get that is NOT playing fetch? Lack of physical and mental stimulation can exacerbate fixations/obsessive behavior (especially in a breed prone to obsessive compulsive behaviors like Bull Terriers). If his main form of exercise is through chasing the ball, it has probably made the problem much worse.**

The cat issue is probably prey drive. It's common among terriers and not something that will go away. When he bit your father he was displaying what is called, ""redirected aggression,"" meaning he felt frustrated about the cat and just latched onto the first thing he saw. Which just happened to be your dad's arm. Redirected aggression is less common in a prey-drive situation... but this dog sounds very tightly wound up with the other things he has going on, so I can't say I'm completely surprised the cat pushed him over the edge.

Here's what I would do:

* If aggression toward small animals (prey drive) is a dealbreaker for your parents, the dog should be returned to the breeder. He will probably always try to chase small animals given the opportunity, and will kill them if he catches them. For better or worse, a strong prey drive is within the range of normal behavior for many terriers. (Redirected aggression toward your parents is less expected, but I suspect that was related to pent-up anxiety/frustration with some of the stuff listed below)
* Remove all balls from the house
* Stop playing fetch with him, start taking him on brisk walks and playing with him in other ways (I bet he'd love a flirt pole!)
* Add more mental stimulation - start feeding him his meals out of puzzle toys (google Kong Wobbler for a starter toy that you can put his kibble in)
* If they do not see drastic improvements with increased exercise and mental simulation over the next ~1-2 weeks, consult with a veterinary behaviorist. Not an ordinary trainer, but a [board-certified veterinary behaviorist](http://www.dacvb.org/about/member-directory/).",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/4sj5yu/help_extreme_ball_obsession_and_fixation_in/#d59s24r,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Honestly, and I say this as an owner of a pit bull: Leave that aggressive dog shit to the real professionals. Especially with pits.

I realize that isn't what you asked, and I don't really have an answer for your training question.

But you already have a pit bull who was possibly abused, bit your dad, and ""would have"" killed the cat. My vote is find one of those pit bull rehab charities and cut and run. I would do the same with my dog if she ever showed an ounce of aggression like that. Are your parents gonna be able to force that dog off something it's attacking, if it ever does? Probably not. What if it's attacking a kid? Or them? Aggressive dogs of all breeds are dangerous as fuck and pits just about top the list of dogs you absolutely don't want to have to fuck with. Not worth the risk imo.

"My MIL with dementia is staying with us and brought her food and attention aggressive Border Collie. I've noticed my dog has started to retaliate. Help!
My MIL with moderate to fairly advanced dementia is staying for us for 10 days. Hygiene, conversation, simple tasks are all difficult but to make this more stressful, she is an alcoholic and sweets addict who has no memory of being an alcoholic. She is constantly hounding us for booze and ice cream, crying and screaming when she doesn't get her way (sorry for the unrelated venting).

The cherry on top of this living situation is her 7 year old female Border Collie, who is the center of her universe. She cannot tell this dog no for anything. She gives her tons of table scraps, feeds her probably 6 or 7 times a day and has emptied a Costco size treat bag in the span of 3 days. We try to stop this behavior but husband and I work full time. We've finally started locking the dog food away, which is a whole other tantrum. 

Guys, I'm not going to lie, but I kind of hate this dog (and I LOVE dogs). It's a Border Collie so it has the manipulative intelligence of a 4 year old human. She's suuuuper affectionate to people, but extremely dog aggressive. Every. Single. Time. she comes over she immediately pees or poos on our carpet. I think to show dominance over my dog. 

I can barely give any affection or attention to my dog without the Border Collie launching at my dog. I've had to move my dogs food into our bedroom so she can eat in peace or there will be a doggy thunderdome. 

My dog is historically extremely submissive and has never shown signs of resource guarding, but I've noticed in just a few days she's turned very territorial. Just now she lunged at MIL dog when it tried to come into my bedroom (where my dogs food is housed). I had to physically put myself between them to get them to stop biting each other.

What am I doing wrong and how do I nip this behavior in the bud? I don't want my dog to turn into MILs dog.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/pozmlw/my_mil_with_dementia_is_staying_with_us_and/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lastly, the good news is that it sounds like MIL and her terror won't be there much longer (although it will seem like an eternity, I'm sure). If you can keep her dog away from yours then the effect on your dog should only be temporary.

You can even put a leash on her when she does that and calmly guide her away, letting her know it's unacceptable, but she probably won't learn easily. Keep her on a long leash or behind a gate/door next to MIL.

I know this dog is frustrating, but it might help to walk her a few times to build a relationship. Once you bond with her a little, it may be easier for her to adapt as a guest in your home.

"Help! Senior dementia dog vs playful young cat
Hi!

I have a wonderful 12 year old standard poodle, we’ve been together since she was a lil babe. About 2 1/2 years ago I got her a kitten (she loves kittens) to keep her company when she was home alone. They got on great, though the cat really bonded to her more than she did to him. 

The problems started when the cat got bigger and older which coincided with the start of my dog’s cognitive (and eyesight) decline. Basically, my dog is increasingly confused, generally wants to be left alone (especially by the very insistently playful cat), and “freaks out” when startled by him (he hides around corners to pounce at her tail)—snapping her jaws wildly in every direction, followed by difficult-to-calm anxiety. The cat does not understand this and thinks it’s just a part of playing. What ends up happening is the cat harasses and torments the dog. He does so non-maliciously; just trying to play. 

I feel bad for both of them! My poor old dog for not getting to just relax, and my kitty for being constantly rejected. My dog has never threatened the cat but I fear she will accidentally bite him during the fearful/confused snapping that is now occurring when she gets startled. They get along very well otherwise, they even drink out of the water bowl at the same time and share treat crumbs. 

I have tried: 

- Playtime with cat every day so he isn’t reliant on just the dog for play. 

- Keeping cat out of bedroom at night: he wants to play most at bedtime and it’s stressful for all of us. But he meows sadly outside my door. He only tries to play for the first 15 minutes of bedtime then snuggles up and sleeps with the dog. 

- Separating cat and dog when he’s “harassing” her to play and she is distressed by it. Feels awful to isolate a cat for trying to play :( I try to distract him but he wants attention from the dog, not from me. 

- Comforting dog while allowing cat to touch her, trying to desensitize her (dog “freaks out” from very minor touches by cat).

PLEASE HELP! It’s just getting worse. They have always been a good duo but my dog’s mental decline seems to be what’s making their relationship hard now. I do not wish to re-home my cat, and getting a second cat for him to play with is not an option (and could double the problem!). Please, is there anything I can do to 1. Teach the cat to respect/understand dog’s boundaries, and 2. Help my dog cope with her ever-increasing distress, or help her learn to respond differently despite the dementia?

Thank you!!",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/utjjn7/help_senior_dementia_dog_vs_playful_young_cat/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Because cats can be difficult to teach, I would try fixing this on the dog end first. Desensitize your dog to that feeling of the cat pouncing on their tail. Just pat their tail with the same amount of force that the cat pounces whenever you’re hanging out with your dog. Then your dog can start to understand that “oh. This isn’t a big deal. Mom does this to pet/play with me all the time”. Even better, would you have the cat nearby while you do this so your dog can smell the cat and associate it with the sudden feeling. If your dog is generally anxious, I would get a ThunderDog calming pheromones diffuser in the room/rooms your dog stays in most. We used the pheromones they make for cats and it helped out cat with his generalized anxiety disorder.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/utjjn7/help_senior_dementia_dog_vs_playful_young_cat/#i9abv99,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Doggy Dementia?? What’s Happening with my Roomates’ dog? Help!
I somewhat recently moved in with a couple who have 2 dogs. (It’s been almost 2 months now.)  When first looking into the place dogs were a plus for me because I love dogs. One of the dogs is such a good boy, a complete sweetheart and is no problem at all. They were honest that the other dog has some behavior issues but that it’s occasional and mostly with men (besides the male owner). Being a self-proclaimed dog person, I took them at their word and figured with some time and treats the dog would learn to love me or at least get used to me enough to not bark obnoxiously. 

The general problem I/we are having is that he barks loudly and nervously when I enter the home. Or when I come out of my room to go to the bathroom or use the kitchen or whatever. Usually though, when I stop, get on his level and he lets me pet him he’ll usually chill out and then be fine. I especially try to reward calmer behavior with treats in addition to pets. 

The more frustrating aspect of this is that it’ll seem like he’s doing better for a period of time. He won’t bark when I come home, come out of my room, go to the bathroom, or go to the kitchen, he enjoys pets, tummy rubs, and even brings me a toy to play with him occasionally. Again I usually try to reward this calmer behavior with treats and pets. 

But this gives me a false sense of security because then he’ll randomly revert back to barking and low key growling at me when I do one or more of the aforementioned things. It’s like I’ll surprise/startle him by coming out of my room or entering/leaving the kitchen...etc. Like he forgot I was there? Or he thinks the old roommate (who was a male) is still there somehow? Just frustrating because I’ll feel like he’ll be making progress and then boom he barks obnoxiously at me again. 

He’s a fairly small dog so I’m not worried about my physical safety. But it grinds on me mentally a little. He was a rescue so I’m sure there’s a whole lot of behavioral baggage behind that...But he’s older I’m guessing 10 or so and has been with current owners for a while now...so you’d think maybe he would have eventually learned that he’s safe? Or he’d at least get used to me and that I’m not gonna hurt him and that I give him treats for calmer behavior..? But idk...

I’m honestly wondering if it’s more than just behavioral issues and given his slightly older age if he has some sort of dog dementia/Alzheimer’s, or short term memory loss or something...? 

Don’t know if it’d be out of place to ask owners about possibly hiring a dog trainer or something that could help determine what exactly is going on and what to do accordingly. I think this would be most ideal for next steps and would not only be helpful for me but for them in the long run when renting to future tenants...

I’m open to any advice/input on my situation. It would be greatly appreciated! Anyone have similar issues? What are some conclusions/solutions you’ve found?",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/iomw6s/doggy_dementia_whats_happening_with_my_roomates/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Does sound like doggy dementia since all new progress reverts backwards.

Give him a pair of old socks or an old shirt in his crate as a toy so he has a constant reminder of your scent already being familar. 

You can also say his name when approaching to help calm him down. I had to do this with my dogs when they would bark whenever I'd come home. Make sure you establish eye contact and they can see your face. Most dogs flip out when they can't see your face, which leads me to...

Lastly, does the dog have cataracts? A high fat diet causes cataracts. Blind dogs are nervous dogs.

"Is there anything I can do for a senior dog with dementia?
My old guy just turned 18. Recently we’ve noticed a lot of changes in him. He can often be found standing still, staring at nothing, unresponsive until he “snaps out of it”. He has started barking LOUD for no reason and doesn’t stop no matter what we do. He will forget to drink, or lose the bowls, and then gorge himself on water until he is sick. He has also started biting us unprovoked. He will actively seek someone out (it seems like he’s looking for someone specific, but I might be anthropomorphizing him) and will bite them hard wherever he can reach. 

The vet says he has dementia and there isn’t really much to do, but because he is in the somewhat early stages and is otherwise healthy we should try to make adjustments for him. 

He is blind and mostly deaf, but beyond the occasional “episode” of dementia he is in very good spirits. He gets zoomies, will jump all over furniture, and play with his sister. We’ve tried to take his shortcomings in stride. He has two beds, and we keep the house well lit. We talk out loud when we enter rooms to keep from scaring him. We have multiple water bowls in the house and make sure he drinks as often as we can.

"Senior dog with dementia having more accidents-- help!
My husband and I got this fantastic beagle 6 years ago from an owner who was having trouble training him.  She worked very, very long hours and as a result he was either kenneled or locked in the back yard all day.  Since the day we got him, he does *not* like being left alone, and the kennel is the absolute worst.  We tried kenneling at first, since we were told he was used to it, but the dog had to be physically pushed in, and would panic so badly he actually broke the sides of it.  We stopped using this device very shortly after getting him, as it was obvious he was terrified of being enclosed.  He used to panic and destroy the house when we'd leave, so we got him a friend, which has worked wonderfully for the last several years.  
  
He's around 13 or 14 now, and has started having accidents in the house.  It sometimes happens when we're home, and almost always occurs when we're gone.  When it happens, he's usually sleeping, and stands and immediately goes-- when this happens, he looks terrified and often confused.  He'll get confused when just walking through a room, and sometimes has problems with the most basic of things, like how to walk around a deck railing....something he used to do all the time.  The vet says he has dementia and to just be patient with him, but his constant accidents are destroying the house.  

When I try confining him, he freaks out, but when I leave him he pees-- how do I minimize damage?!  Our house has a very open floor plan, so the best place to confine him without him feeling confined is to just gate off the main level of the house and let him have the run of the living room, dining room, and kitchen.  I wish I could just confine him to the kitchen, since it's easier to clean, but I can't gate a doorway that doesn't exist and don't know of any way to confine him without him feeling trapped.  Help, please?  
  
For what it's worth, he is on a handful of meds, including something for his kidneys, which is supposed to reduce the number of accidents.

"Grandpa with dementia kicked my dog, how to handle?
I've posted several times on this sub about my dog Piper, she's a Pyr/Catahoula mix that just turned a year. She's really sweet, but her biggest issue is that when she's overstimulated, she gets hyperactive and starts jumping/nipping. Obviously since she's 75 pounds and pretty strong, this is an unacceptable behaviour, and we're thinking of hiring a trainer in the new year. For now, we're ignoring/ceasing play when she does this, or holding her collar to calm her. Most of all, we're trying to avoid this situation altogether, by being calm around her and not playing rough games. 


My grandparents are visiting for a few days (my boyfriend, me, and Piper are at my parents place for the week, and grandparents came for xmas) and my grandpa is starting to really deteriorate mentally. Mostly he just forgets things, repeats conversations and questions, etc. He also seems to think that Piper is actually my old family dog, Shale, who died a year and a half ago. They look similar (Shale was a black lab, Piper looks like a yellow lab) so I get it. Unfortunately, Shale never had behavioural issues like Piper's, so my grandpa has been playing rough with Piper since he got here. 


A little while ago, he was coming up the stairs, and Piper started nipping at his elbow as he reached the top. He started yelling ""Hey! No! Stop that!"" and then kicked her away from him. I've never seen him angry like the before, and definitely not at an animal. As I took her to my room, I heard him say ""Why did she bite me? She never bit me before?"" and I realized he had mixed her up with Shale again. My mom came in later to reassure me that I had handled the situation well and told me that when I was out earlier, my grandpa had been playing rough and growling at Piper, which explains her reaction to him. Basically, she doesn't think Piper was really at fault, and isn't worried about having her here. 


My issue is, how do I handle this? I know my dog's behaviour was not good, but it's something that everyone else in the household knows about and can generally deal with. I don't know how to explain to my grandpa not to play rough with my dog, since he will likely forget it in a few minutes (its been half an hour, he probably doesn't even remember her biting at him.) My boyfriend is also uncomfortable, since he doesn't like seeing the dog punished like that but is also aware that my grandpa isn't all there. Anything I can do, short of just keeping them apart? (And if anyone has advice on how to stop the jumping/nipping, I'll take that too!!)

,"No, short of keeping them apart, you cannot solve the issues your grandfather is going through. He’s not doing anything wrong and his issue is likely life long, so putting the dog in that situation with him is setting both the dog, and grandpa, up to fail. You know your dogs excitable, grandpa thinks it’s a dog that won’t get overly excited, it’s a recipe for a nip every time. You can totally have them together, just have piper tethered to you or your BF and have you there and separating piper and grandpa as necessary. It never has to escalate if you monitor it. Separate them early and quickly.



I get that you want everyone involved in the family gathering, but Piper is an animal, and doesn’t understand the situation. Grandpa has a medical issue that is going to cause a challenge as well, and you know he doesn’t understand either (long enough for it to change his actions). Just know both have the best intentions in mind, and understand it’s not a BAD thing to separate them. 


Encourage positive interactions when Piper has been heavily exercised and isn’t as excitable. I think your grandpa sounds like he’d really enjoy being around her still. Keep an eye on her body language and separate her if she’s getting over stimulated.

,">I know my dog's behaviour was not good, but it's something that everyone else in the household knows about and can generally deal with. 

This is not a replacement for training. You have an untrained, poorly behaved dog. The solution is management and training.

Management: Keep the dog out of situations that will cause problems. With this, that means keeping her away from children and anyone who she can knock over or who can't handle her. Keep her away from anyone who cannot actively help you train her. Anyone who is not helping with training will set you back.

Training: you can start with basics. Does she know sit? Well? REALLY well? Start with that. Teach her sit, and do it 17,000 times a day. Get really good treats for her so sitting is the best thing ever. Keep treats on you, on your boyfriend, on every surface in your house, and ANYTIME she is sitting, she gets a treat, a reward, attention. Even if you didn't ask for it. Teach her that the BEST thing she can do is be sitting. Or laying down.

Teach her a command like settle. She can play for a little, but once you say settle, it's time to relax. Say settle, and wait. Stand like a statue, arms crossed behind you, not looking at her. Wait for her to calm down. Let her jump, bark, whatever. Eventually (hopefully) she'll try sitting. If she doesn't, tell her to sit once she has taken a minute. Give her a treat at that point, but not excitedly, just a quiet ""good girl"" and a treat. Check out this video on [Go Wild and Freeze](https://youtu.be/DhZezotl_7w). Again, let anyone in your household or close family who can help, help. 

Then just work on settle. If she gets too ramped up, tell her to settle. Have her sit anytime anyone approaches her, everytime you come home, etc. Her greeting for people should be sitting. Eventually she will offer the sit on her own, and everytime she sits she gets a treat. Bonus points if you treat her for sitting before she gets excited in the first place.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/7mc7hq/grandpa_with_dementia_kicked_my_dog_how_to_handle/#drtd3no,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"My dog was quite similar when I got him. He was a shelter dog, 80 lbs, and it was his 2nd time in the shelter, he was a bit over a year old when we adopted him. He had some issues when we got him, anxiety and abandonment, and he would bite everyone CONSTANTLY and jumped on everyone. He got overstimulated with everything and everyone even after getting used to us.

We did the cease play method. If he still bit and did not respond to 'no' or 'stop' we put him in time out (only for like a 1-2 minutes) We got good rubber toys and a rope, whenever he started getting nippy we would try to put the toy in his mouth so he'd play rough with that. If he bit us instead of the toy, we'd cease play or do the time out method. We worked on this everyday for a couple hours until he tired himself out. (We would just sit and watch tv while holding the toy) Getting him milk bones helped a lot too since he is just a dog that needs to bite things.

In about 3 weeks, he stopped biting people all together. Doesn't jump on anyone unless you tell him to (chest patting) 

The only thing we haven't been able to train is his walking unfortunately.

"My dog attacked me when I tried to take his toy from him
I'm crying while I type this, my hands hurt so bad and I'm shaken. My dog (16 year old Jack Russell Terrier) has occasionally shown possessiveness over food/toys in the past but it's usually mild and if I really insist on taking it from him, he's pretty good about dropping it or letting me take it from him without a fuss.

He's also shown a few signs of aggression (usually when I try to pick him up/touch him) so I'm usually respectful about backing off and leaving him be on those occasions. On the rare occasions (maybe 4-5 times in his life) where he has nipped me before, it's been quick warning nips that don't break the skin and I back off immediately because I realize I'm invading his personal space.

Today though, he was chewing a new toy we bought him and being unusually possessive/aggressive. He was very obviously defensive when I tried to take it. I probably should have just walked away and taken it from him later but in the past if I stood my ground and really insisted he would always let me have it. So I reached out to take it from him and he suddenly attacked me, not just warning nips but full on bites on my hands and wrists. He actually let go at one point and lunged again to bite me a second time, I tried to move away and he kept coming after me. It broke the skin, I have tooth-sized holes in my hands and smaller bite marks around the wounds. It scared the shit out of me.

He's never done anything like this before to me, I would not be as worried if they were just warning nips because I invaded his space but this was like a full on attack. Did I just push his buttons by accident and he reacted so severely because of his age? I threw the toy away but I don't know what to do if this happens again.

He's always been a little touchy/irritable with other people but he's always been pretty respectful with me because I'm good about reading his moods and leaving him alone when possible. It's kind of silly and maybe I'm anthropomorphizing him a little but it honestly kind of hurt my feelings - I don't know why he felt like he had to escalate to attacking me like that. Did he not know I would have backed off with a warning nip like always? I've always felt pretty confident that I could read his moods but now I'm worried I've been scaring/intimidating him without realizing. I don't know why his reaction was so severe.

\-----------------------------------------------

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the kind words. I was really shaken when I wrote this but now that I've bandaged up my hands and read over the comments I feel better about the whole thing. He does have pretty bad cataracts and I suspect he has been showing signs of doggy dementia over the past year, unfortunately (he'll walk into rooms and stand there while staring into space, for example. He seems constantly confused/lost). I think it was probably a combination of me trying to take the toy away from him + possible dementia symptoms that caused him to get scared/upset, so I don't feel offended anymore. As soon as I had bandaged my hands he was right back to his normal self, following me around the house and kissing my fingers :'( poor baby.

He's otherwise in good spirits most of the time and he's still pretty spry during cold weather/when he wants to play. Hopefully he's not in too much pain or distress, we do the best we can to comfort him and make sure he's feeling comfortable. I've been less insistent on touching him when he growls at me, for example, in case he's in pain - I'll add ""not taking his toys away from him unless necessary"" to the list.

Also, I got my last tetanus shot in 2017, so I should be covered there. I had to change the gauze on my hands twice because I kept bleeding through the bandages but I've pinched the skin together with band-aids to close the wound better and it looks like that's stopped the bleeding more or less. I'm going to keep an eye on it over the next few days in case there are signs of infection, my dog has had all his shots but I know dog bites can carry funky bacteria so if the pain gets worse or I see any  weird leakages I'll head to the doctor ASAP.

,"So, with a 15 year old dog I'm very concerned about several factors. 

a) he could be suffering from arthritis or another condition that gives him almost constant pain, thus resulting in general negativity whenever he is touched. if he is constantly in a bad mood or constantly shies away from being touched, this could be the cause. I had an 11 year old dog who suddenly bit me when I went in for a belly rub which was WILDLY out of character and it turns out he had a painful growth on his abdomen.

b) he could be going blind/deaf and therefore you are ""surprising"" him by suddenly getting into his space. he could be partially blind, or have glaucoma which could be clouding certain areas of his vision, or he could only have close vision (like how older humans need reading glasses).

c) he could be suffering from mental decline. just like people, dogs can get dementia or just slow down with age so they don't understand things like they used to. My mom's 16 year old dog suffered from this, he would wander around the house howling at night and sometimes he would react to my mom like she was a stranger in his house, barking and growling.

I would strongly encourage taking him to a vet and having them at the very minimum checking him for sight/hearing loss and for any notable spots of pain. Mild medication such as an anti-inflammatory may help him with pain and vastly improve his quality of life.

That said, if a dog is showing signs of aggression, you should not confront them, the dog is matching your energy. Try to re-direct with a high value treat, and when the dog transfers attention to the treat, take the toy away and praise them with ""yes!"" in a positive voice. Do this often when you notice growling or possessiveness, associate it with ""give"" or ""drop it"" so they know what you want. Make sure to reward them for giving up the toy. If the toy is in your possession, practice ""leave it"" by holding it in your hand and rewarding the dog for leaving you and it alone. You should not allow him to escalate to ""warning nips"" like you have been doing. You are teaching him that he has to escalate every time. And you are teaching him to nip. If a dog ""warning nips"" the wrong person, they will be accused of biting and that can be a really bad problem.

I'm sorry you were hurt and that you are upset. Please remember that a 15 year old dog is equivalent to a 90 year old person, and just like elderly people can lash out at caretakers, he probably doesn't realize how much he hurt you.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/s7wfv3/my_dog_attacked_me_when_i_tried_to_take_his_toy/#htd7i88,,,,,,,,,,,,

For yourself self I ask you to make sure your tetanus shot is up to date. I deal with rescues and trouble dogs for a volunteer group. I've been bit a few times over the years, and my GP advises getting one just in case. You don't have to say it was your dog or anything, especially if it's been a few years since your last shot.

,"First: I’m sorry that happened. He’s 15. I imagine he’s lacking in some sight or all (sometimes you can’t tell a dog is blind, they adapt so well). He is probably a bit stiff or arthritic. Pain causes all kinds of grouchy. 
Second: it is never a good idea to “take” anything away by just reaching in when you visible saw the signs of possession. It’s like their food bowls. Create boundaries. When you want to take a toy away from him bring an older one he identifies and do the “this not this”. Also, chew time to them is like your personal quiet time. 

Don’t take it personal you made a mistake; that doesn’t excuse the reaction but it sounds like a boundary issue for both of you.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/s7wfv3/my_dog_attacked_me_when_i_tried_to_take_his_toy/#htck06y,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the future, if your dog is telling you hes uncomfortable or doesnt want you to touch something believe him.

Dont push his boundaries because ""we have a special relationship"". Everyone can be pushed outside their patience, and thats exactly what happened. You ignored his warning, like you have before, and this time he ran out of patience with you taking his things.

If you encounter this again, wait him out or ask if he wants to go for a walk. Go do something else with him, then put him in another room or outside. ONLY when there is a solid door between you and the dog do you pick up a guarded item. Don't drag him away, don't ignore his signals. Safety first.

,"I know how much this can rattle you when it’s an older dog that you’ve loved and trusted for so long. I’m really sorry this happened – you sound like you need a hug more than anything. Folks have covered things really well. If his senses are going, it’s easier to surprise him. 

His vision may be worse than you think. I had a wire fox terrier who was still running around the house in her old age, but when we took her in for her checkup, the vet said, “That’s great, but don’t rearrange the furniture.” She was just super smart and knew the house really well. She was also very high energy and could be possessive of stuff, so when her hearing also got worse, we used both visual and auditory cues so we didn’t scare her. 

I also had a westie who was loyal, determined, sweet, and dumb as a post. We learned that she didn’t deal with change well, particularly as she aged. It stressed her out a lot, and she had similar reactions to what you describe on a couple of occasions. So I definitely do think it could be a cognitive thing, or a combination of factors. 

You may feel better if your pup gets a checkup just to see if there’s anything that can be addressed. And definitely take care of yourself.

On the day she spoke mostly to us and showed a few ""tricks"" that helped. Maybe they'll work for you

1) Do training, so the dog know whos in charge 

2) Never take from the dog, swap for something better, eventually the dog get used to trading up

3) Treats are in a hierarchy with meat at the top, a top treat for us is a whole chicken dog treat chopped up small.

4) If the dog is guarding and you HAVE to get the dog to give up the item (ours stole a sharpie and was chewing on it) throw a treat close, and then throw a trail further away til the dog moves off the item. Also treat as a reward when you've took the item.

"My dog is overly codependent and I can’t take it anymore
Hello, I have an 11-year old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

In the last year she has become unmanageably codependent. She immediately starts screaming, and pacing, and sounding like she’s dying if she loses sight of me, and the sounds don’t stop for hours.

I can’t take it anymore. I love her, but I’m just not in a position in my life where I can handle this.

I don’t know what to do about it. She makes horrible noises if I leave to go to the bathroom, or to the store. People keep looking at me like I’m an abuser and the people I live with hate it.

I used to be able to put her in a contained area and leave for hours at a time and she’d cry a bit, then move on, but now she cries and barks and digs and makes sounds like she’s dying for HOURS. I feel like I’m walking on glass and I can’t take it.

There’s nothing seemingly wrong with her health wise, she just has the worst separation anxiety I’ve ever seen.

I don’t want to rehome her, but I’m getting to the point of resentment because I feel like I have to plan my entire life around her and it’s exhausting.

What can I do about this?

Edit: Rehoming her is the LAST thing I want to do, it was just an option that I typed out in frustration. and I don’t appreciate the insults and assumptions about my life.

"Does anyone have any experience with their dog grounding themselves to keep calm during rain? 
EDIT: When I say ”grounding” I’m referring to electrical grounding. Like literally touching the ground or patio outside (or purchasing a mat for inside that claims to have an electrical ground connection) for the purpose of releasing a buildup of static electricity. The reason this was suggested was because my dog is responding fearfully to precipitation that is NOT making noise, so it may be that he’s responding to an atmospheric condition instead (like a buildup of static electricity, or pressure/humidity change, etc)



My dog's fear of rain/precipitation has gotten so intense, and despite the multitude of things we've tried the only thing that seems to really help him is going outside. It's been suggested that maybe he's grounding himself...is this a real thing that anyone has experience with?? All the studies I've looked at seem to have mixed results or are inconclusive...

And for some background....my dog is a 12 year old border collie/golden mix in relatively good health for his age. His hearing has gotten pretty bad though, so we're sure that this fear has nothing to do with the sound of rain or thunder (he gets scared with drizzle or even before rain/snow starts).

When he gets scared of precipitation he paces, shakes, drools excessively, paws/claws at us, and pants, and he'll do all of this for HOURS. He's usually only scared at night (he'll keep us up basically the entire night), and the fear has really only gotten bad since we moved into a new house 2 years ago. When he goes to stay with our in-laws they say his rain fear isn't as bad there...

The fear definitely started as an aversion to the loud noise from fireworks (probably about 4-5 years ago), which then translated to a fear of thunder, which then turned into rain of any sort (even without thunder), and now is any type of precipitation at all OR the general promise of it.

And the things that we've tried that haven't worked:

-Thunder shirt

-Comforting him

-Ignoring him

-Playing with him

-Giving him treats or distractions

-Calming or loud music

-Rubbing dryer sheets on him...(apparently supposed to help with static electricity buildup)

-Exercising him extra on days that we know it's supposed to rain at night

-Giving him extra nooks/forts/safe spaces/whatever where he can hide while scared

Things that sort of work:

-His Trazodone prescription....but honestly it takes 2-4 hours for that to kick in, and sometimes it never does. And then he'll be groggy and out of it for the entire next day

The only thing that seems to help:

-Going outside into the backyard. He'll come back inside and be good for maybe 20-60 minutes, but then he's right back to being scared afterwards

If buying him a grounding mat for inside our house could be an answer and anyone has any experience with this I'd love to hear about it. Or if you have any other experience with a similar situation please please let me know!

"Peeing inside, we've tried everything
We have an 11yo female Maltese dog that was previously house trained well without accidents. She recently started peeing inside again and although we've really tried every tip in the book we can't get her to stop.

We adopted her over a year ago after her previous owner went to an elderly care home. She had a hard time getting used to living with us but she's changed so much and seems much more at ease now. But even when she was very stressed there were never any accidents. 

So she started peeing inside a few months ago. We've been to the vet, she's had labs, ultrasounds and every possible test done but there seems to be nothing wrong with her medically. And she's deliberately peeing inside, it's not accidental urine loss. She doesn't seem confused, she always pees in the same spot and knows really well not to do it when we're around. So it doesn't seem like dementia either.
We've tried letting her out more, tried positively reinforcing peeing outside, tried crate training but nothing seems to work in the long term. She won't pee in the crate nor will she pee somewhere else if she doesn't have access to that particular spot. But as soon as she has unsupervised access to that spot she'll do it again. It's like she decided this place is her personal toilet. Unfortunately we can't restrict access to that spot permanently since it's in our main living area, but it's behind a corner so we can't keep an eye on it all the time.

We're really desperate, she gets angry when we try to send her outside more often and she even bit my husband a few times when he picked her up to go pee. We have a baby and small child, so we can't keep her if she's aggressive, we don't want our kids to be crawling around in dog pee and rehoming is not an option since she's so anxious. I'm really hoping for a tip that will work because I feel like we're out of options.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1ik4ydf/peeing_inside_weve_tried_everything/,,,,,,,,,,,,

The small one will stop with verbal commands (usually “stop” “off” or “no”). 

At times it will be clearly due to resource guarding — it has happened during meal prep for the two of them or over resource guarding the couch. However there are other times where it comes out of nowhere and completely unprovoked — the greyhound will be sleeping on another couch with no toys or food around while my partner and I are on a separate couch with the small one, and she’ll get up all stiff and then go after the greyhound. 

We separate them during meals and meal prep now, and any time the smaller one attacks we separate the two of them for awhile, gating off the little one in a separate room. We also try to give them some separate time away from each other each day. About half the time we can prevent the attack before it happens because the little one will get all stiff and stare at the greyhound before doing it and we can redirect her or distract her. Other times it’ll happen too fast for us to catch, but she’ll stop with a verbal command. 

They’ve both been to the vet and have clean bills of health — The greyhound is elderly and we think starting to have some dementia and arthritis but otherwise is okay. Nothing has been found wrong with the little one. 

We’re working on getting a behavioralist in to see what’s going on, but I wanted to check here too and see if anyone has experience with this or tips in the meantime. Please be kind as I’m very concerned and we’re doing our best to mitigate the problem. 

We’re wondering if it’s due to the greyhounds dementia, can the little one sense something is different? Or is it maybe just because they’re both getting older?

Small dog is a mix of shetland sheepdog, staffordshire terrier, shiba inu, and some mystery if that contributes any context. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hni6x0/dog_attacking_other_dog_seemingly_out_of_nowhere/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"10 year old bichon constantly whines
So in July we took on my grandmas 10 year old bichon. She had a bad fall and was diagnosed with dementia tia and moved to assisted living so she can’t have him anymore. 

He whines all the time. At first we were understanding that it was a sudden change for him. But he eats just fine, plays with our dogs, and etc.  

But he is always whining. First thing in the morning till night time. Just constantly whining.

"Senior dog help - possibly anxiety?
Hi All, Thanks in advance for any thoughts. I have a senior boy with worsening behaviors that I think could be anxiety.

My husband and I adopted our 10 year old guy (we think part pit, part hound, part lab, 70 lb) 7 months ago from a rescue after fostering for 1 month. We got a call from daycare yesterday saying he was excessively anxious and trying to bite at the fences/walls, possibly trying to get out. He was pacing and whining, but didn't have aggression toward dogs and loved the human 1:1 time (which they pulled him to to see if if he calmed, which did help). They said it was probably just an off day and are willing to have him come back for more time and to try a calming chew (Composure by VetriScience). He usually does okay at daycare so this was new. He's a velcro dog at home, follows me everywhere and this is not new. This week however he has been refusing to go outside to potty at night unless I go outside and stand in the yard. Taking a flash light doesn't help, and he refuses to go with my husband at all. When I let him out in the back during the day, he will stand and bark at the door until I come out (this isn't new but its worsening). We've noticed light reflections and shadows bother him and he will try to bite at the reflections and sometimes bite walls, but the daycare didn't think this was the issue but was going to check with the handlers in the yard to see if they thought it could be contributing. I'm typically at home with my dogs except for 1 week a month when I travel for work and my parents baby sit, so he is either free to roam at home or put in the laundry room or bedroom with his brother dog which seems to be okay. He has not been destructive.

He's otherwise a healthy guy. He has lipomas but his senior lab work (blood counts, chemistries, HW) earlier this year was normal. He has mild-moderate cataracts but can see okay (not running into anything, notices squirrels, etc). We don't know anything about his history as he was found as a stray. He loves my other senior pit/lab mix and my parents corgi and labradoodle and they'll play occasionally and sometimes cuddle but are mostly just hanging out together. He LOVES the new flirt pole I made, which we've played with a lot the past week. I'm wondering if this is causing any issues so I'm not going to use it for a while and see how he behaves. He has climbs over baby gates at my parents house when they baby sit, so we're all on escape artist alert. 

Any thoughts for a senior dog? Wondering if its just worsening anxiety, or possibly dementia. I've read others on Reddit have used Zesty Paws Calming Bites and was going to try the Composure chews. How can I help his anxiety when I'm away and when he's at daycare?

"Nighttime nonsense
I’ve searched the sub and haven’t found exactly my issue, so I figured I’d see if anybody has any ideas.

My 9 y/o Borzoi is incredibly lazy. She limps for a bit when she gets up (we’ve spent thousands on tests, everything comes back normal - at this point we’re thinking a possible nerve issue/maybe her leg falling asleep before it sorts itself out after walking a bit). She is walked everyday, but doesn’t like to go too far and we aren’t pushing her due to this mystery on/off lameness. Vet says she’s otherwise in great health, we don’t know.

We try to stimulate her mentally with licky mats and bones, but otherwise she sleeps a lot.

My issue is that she is SO restless at night. She’ll come to bed with us and rest for an hour, then jump up, run outside to bark ONCE, come back in. And then repeat the process every hour or so. We don’t have to let her out, as we have a dog door, but she is constantly coming and going, seemingly zooming/barking at nothing.

Sure she MIGHT be hearing something, but she is not the kind of dog to bark at stimuli - doesn’t bark at cats, mailmen, other dogs, etc. It’s definitely an energy outlet. She never does this during the day. I know senior dogs typically get restless at night, but I really don’t think it’s dementia, as she never seems disoriented or confused - just energized.

I don’t feel like I have a ton of any other options for getting her energy out, she just doesn’t care about toys, and is only motivated by SOME treats - and she’s lazy already, I don’t want to overfeed her.

Any opinions? Do your dogs do this? ",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1clpi3o/nighttime_nonsense/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The panting will be the death of me. Help!
I have a 10yo English bulldog mix. He’s a reactive dude and was bred incredibly poorly but now is generally a lazy old man and can be managed after years of training. For backstory: he was crate trained until he was around 2 and then he used to sleep in bed with my mum until I moved out, but for the last 3 years at least he has slept in his crate without concern. 

Old dogs can learn new tricks though apparently. The beginning of the month he had a lame back leg, likely a sprain (double hip dysplasia will do that to you). He was acting ok besides the limp but thought I’d give him some metacam before bed anyways. So we went to bed and he started aggressively panting, like he does in the car when we get on the loud highway, it sounds very panicky. So I took him out of his crate, we went outside for a pee and came back in and I realized he was trembling so I figured I’d let him sleep in the bed with me so I could keep an eye on him. He settled fairly quickly and was fine the next day. Big mistake. Now, every night, instead of going right to the crate at bedtime he tries to get on my bed and has to be moved. Then he starts panting and trembling, for at least an hour. He did it for 56 minutes tonight and just stopped suddenly, which is what happens. We’ve been sleeping with ear plugs. Nothing has changed in our routine which he’s basically had for 3 years. No change in heating in the house. He will go in the crate HAPPILY during the day or if we leave, no panting. 

I have tried: Pain meds before bed, orthopaedic mattress, heating pad, feeding him only in his crate, praising him +++, blanket covering the whole crate, no blanket on the crate, cooling the house down, throwing something and saying no, crating him more often, increasing training and walks, vet check was clear. Nothing is working lol I feel like it’s gotta be behavioural, old man wants to be in bed with mum but I’d rather pull my toenails off with pliers then sleep with the dog in the bed. He has trazadone for use in long car rides but I actually am unsure of the safety of using it long term so haven’t tried it. 

Any tips or recommendations are welcome!

Edit: he has been vet checked, has been given pain medication and is not in pain. I do like the “you’re heartless for being annoyed” and the “he’s a bulldog what do you expect” comments as if he isn’t 10 and this is a new issue (he’s a mix, his face is actually not as flat as a normal English bulldog and has never had breathing issues before, he just has bad anxiety/temperament and hip issues) lmao but anyways had a vet appt today and they are actually concerned it’s the beginning signs of dementia so pig dog may have won this one.

,"Go to bed an hour early.

Put the dog on lead and walk him into the bedroom and into the crate so he cannot try to get on the bed.

Give him a chew or a stuffed kong when you put him in the crate for the night.

Repeat a few nights in a row.

The panting probably cannot be resolved. A poorly bred, older bulldog is going to have a hard time breathing, and will start panting quickly if he is anxious or stressed.

"Extreme fear in rescue dog, advice needed
I've never made a post before but I did read the rules and am doing my best to follow them all. Thanks in advance for your help!

We rescued a ~1 year old great pyrenees and brought her home a week ago. I don't have a super clear picture of her history but she was rescued by a foster person from an unsafe situation, and stayed with the foster in an outdoor kennel for a few weeks before coming to us. Her original owner was older and had dementia and was shooting at his dogs. She is very afraid of people. She has no aggression and we've been told that she loves other dogs. She was transferred to Washington State from Texas on what was undoubtedly a very traumatic long trip in a crate on a bus, we picked her up straight from the bus.

She is paralyzed with fear. She will sit or lay in one spot an entire day. If we pet her she holds totally still and trembles. I have wyze cams recording her overnight, she stays wherever she is all night even while we are sleeping. 

Our vet originally advised us to never pull her out of there and to let it be her safe space, but when we tried, she stayed in for 24+ hours and our vet recommended that we take her out. I would be fine with her going potty in the house if she was only willing to leave the crate while we're asleep, but she will just hold it. She is not food motivated at all and won't eat most treats even if we leave her with them overnight. She does not like to be looked at or touched. We usually have to carry her outside to go to the bathroom (we try 3x a day but she hates it so much that we only make her do it 2x if she seems very upset).

Things we’ve tried:
- calm voices/calm household, not bugging her most of the time but petting her and offering her treats (not food AT ALL motivated unfortunately and only eats when we aren't there)
- cozy crate, door always open
- keeping a radio on so she gets used to voices
- gentle bells on the doors and making a routine before we try to take her outside (tell her what we are doing, ring the bells, etc)
- pheromone plug in thing
- thundershirt 
- our vet has recommended slowly moving her food farther away from the crate (currently she's only eating in there) and preventing her from going in it sometimes to force her to get used to her surroundings -- we tried this last night and she just didn't eat. 

Frankly, most of the things we've tried seem like they would only work on a much less scared dog (i.e. tempt her with food, wait for her to come out of her crate on her own)

All of the advice I can find on dogs with fear or anxiety are for dogs much less scared than she is. My main question is: How can I help her overcome her extreme fear? Medication would be really difficult to get in her. Is it bad to pet her gently and talk to her in a gentle voice if she doesn't like it? Should we not pet her or interact with her while she's in her crate? 

I am also looking for veterinary behaviorists but have been unable to find any in my area (I'm 30 minutes NE of Seattle). There are some dog trainers, but they seem to be obedience focused and I'm not sure if they would be helpful for our situation.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/13sjnmt/extreme_fear_in_rescue_dog_advice_needed/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You need to readjust your strategy. Your dog doesn't know how to dog right now, so you're better off watching a few feral cat gentling videos and going from there. You will need something that she will eat no matter what. It doesn't matter what it is. Plain hot dogs, hell even plain McDonald's cheeseburgers. 


Keep a slip lead near by and use that to get her in and out for potty breaks, hopefully she responds to that. It will be less traumatic than being picked up. 


Then it's all about treats and time. Dont look at her, don't touch her if you can avoid it. Just sit nearby, not facing her, and read a book and toss a chunk of whatever it is that she can't ignore every so often.

"Help! Deaf senior dog refuses to pee before bed, wakes before dawn.
Hi folks, 

First time in this sub after the classic “google search + reddit to see if anyone has asked same hyper specific question”. My *fifteen and nine month old* Aussie + blue heeler + sheltie mix (?) rules the fucking roost in my house. We’ve been desperately experimenting with her schedule basically about trying to mitigate accidents (both pee and poop) and UTIs for about the last six months and have an OSHA board tracking her streaks without an incident. She always has access to water 24/7 since her kidney levels are getting up there. She is on a fairly regular schedule of peeing first thing in the AM (anywhere from 5am to 8am. We do not wake her to go out potty and just take her as soon as we hear the dreaded* jingling of her tags.) and then peeing 6-8 hours after the first pee (we do take her out in between to no avail.) The problem is, we have been trying to get her to pee before we, her human slaves, need to go to sleep, and she will. Not. Go. She gives me this fluoride stare for up to thirty minutes outside in the cold. She is 100% deaf so any commands are lost on her and I am certain whatever dementia she has would not let her learn new nonverbal commands. Then, she wakes from anywhere between 2 to 4 AM and just walks around. I feel so bad because I know she needs to go and the last thing I want her to get is a bladder infection, but I’m worried if I cave and take her out it will push her pee schedule further and further into the abyss of the night. 

If anyone has any tips on how to encourage my old gal to squeak one out at a reasonable hour, please let me know. Thank you in advance!

 One was indoor artificial potty spot. You can get them on Amazon. We did this towards the end when he struggled to hold it at any time. It got put by the back door on the tile incase of misses. Where I'm at it gets -15f so you can understand why he didn't like to go out. 

The second though first thing we did was up potty times to every four hours and re introduced the door bells for him to nose. We also integrated fresh meat treats to encourage going out and letting us know just like with a pup.

,"Odds are her success peeing in the morning has less to do with the time and more about being used to peeing when she wakes.  So if she wakes up in the middle of the night from insomnia, pain/arthritis, or boredom then her body thinks it's time to pee.  Maybe on weekends when you're staying up late (or can sleep in), try to see what's causing her to wake up?

Since he didn't respond to new training to use a pad in a spot of our choosing, we just had to watch where he preferred to go inside then put a pad there and taped down trash bags on surrounding carpet  in case he missed.  When we had guests over he was in a diaper, but unexpected guests were also surprisingly understanding.

It was inconvenient, but easier for everyone.  Less baths and cleanup from accidents.  We were just sleeping worse and worse trying to listen for him moving, and his arthritis pain was flaring up from excessive trips outside. Sometimes it's best to just make things easier rather than ideal.  No amount of routines or training can necessarily make the challenges of old age elegant for animals or elderly humans.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/s617h1/help_deaf_senior_dog_refuses_to_pee_before_bed/#ht2h7l8,,,,,,,,,,,,

Have you tried taking her for a walk ?

My GSD has his 7:00 walk, 16:30 walk, and 20:30 walk, and that schedule works for workdays, and when I want to sleep in during the weekends I usually take him for a short walk before bedtime, which usually buys me a couple of hours the next morning :-)",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/s617h1/help_deaf_senior_dog_refuses_to_pee_before_bed/#ht1koi0,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I'm very fond of senior dogs, and have spent \*years\* getting up on their schedule to let them out (and glad that they can still tell me, and  can still hold it). Honestly, tell yourself it won't  be forever, and just take her out when she wakes.

My guess would be that her sleep pattern is changing, and that when you try to wake her up to go out, she doesn't think ""oh, it's time to go to bed"", she probably thinks, ""I've already been deeply asleep, so it's the middle of the night, so why would I want to go out now"". Then, when she wakes at 3 or 4, to her body, it's time for her morning pee.

I know it's hard, but it won't be forever, sadly.....(and please don't withhold water from a dog with medical issues).",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/s617h1/help_deaf_senior_dog_refuses_to_pee_before_bed/#ht2oy7v,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I got my new friend today but, hear me out, I don’t know how to train her to let me put the leash on lol
Update: Day 2 was a lot easier, she still shies away but she'll let me (gently while sitting on the ground) leash her. She just back up where she's already sitting, accessible but apprehensive. She's getting better about getting in the car, but theres still work to do, and she will only potty at the dog park unfortunately so we need to work on other appropriate places to potty that arent a 10 minute walk, 45 minute sit around waiting to potty (she's not ready to play yet but likes to explore the dog park) then a 10 minute walk back. I'm just letting her be a dog on her terms at this point, obviously I'm keeping her safe and attended to but I'm matching her pace.

So like I said I need help training her to put the leash on BUT:

Any other dog I’ve had was already trained for this, she handles BEAUTIFULLY once on the leash, like slack on a retractable leash and frequent eye contact with a beautiful heel the whole time so I don’t even have to train for that. The problem is she nearly panics when you pull the leash out and I basically had to trap her in the tiny in/out pen at the dog park to leash her, but it was incredibly easy to get her in the pen with no coaxing. Once the leash was on she’s fine and walking beautifully again.

She’s such a sweet girl and you can tell she just wants to be a good girl, but still very shy so we will have to go slow to build that confidence. Obviously we need to learn how to leash her so we can take her potty and I want to be able to take her places and let her explore. I really just need tips on how to raise her confidence, and take to putting on the leash.

[Dog tax!](https://imgur.com/gallery/rOeYL3s) We aren’t quite sure on her name yet

Edit: we’re going with Clover. 

She has decided to sleep under the bed tonight, but tried to get on the bed until she saw the kitty and they’re still beefing because kitty has always been my baby so he’s a little jealous. I trained my kitty in the soft paw martial arts so he doesn’t use his claws, he’s a VERY good boy. There has been no growling on either side, and only one hiss when she snuck up on him.

She’s pretty sure she likes me, unsure about my husband still and was a LOT easier getting on the leash when I sat on the ground instead of kneeling. Once again, another beautiful walk (this time on the short plain nylon loop leash she came home with) and I’m telling you I was walking her with the leash looped around my wrist (ready to grab) but like totally loose. She’s AMAZING on the leash.

We did walk past some neighboring dogs barking and fighting with each other and she got a little distracted. Light pulling at the beginning of the altercation, honestly I’d just call it light tension because she wasn’t fighting for more, but a quick gentle tug, “come on Clover” and she just walked away.

I love her, and she’s gonna need her time, I know this, but I also know that a week from now, when she’s not in the same kennel as her 80lb rambunctious brother she’ll be feeling herself more. There were a lot of reasons why I got her, she’s quiet and shy, she’s SUPER sweet, I could tell she needs patience, and honestly she looks like my childhood dog my parents didn’t want to let go of. TL;DR I  watched him suffer through doggy Alzheimer’s and dementia and he required a lot of patience and assistance. They look so much alike, their personalities are similar she’s just more reserved and I *THINK* her tail might even be curly too!

Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart for your concern about her time and effort, and even my souvenir leash that will be retired and the *nylon loop* will be replaced this week.

,"I see that you use a flexi, does your dog give the same response for a regular leash? That would make it easy if just using a different leash was less scary. Flexi leads are really difficult to use anyways and potentially dangerous. 

Have you ever tried a slip lead? You have to be careful your dog doesn’t pull with one on but they do make ones that [turn into a harness.](https://www.amazon.com/Harness-Lead-Comfortable-Resistant-Reduces/dp/B07ND5R4C5) Grabbing for the collar is stressful for a lot of dogs. If you reach for the collar without the leash in your hands does your dog react? That might be ears going back, sticking the tongue out, panting, yawning, leaning away. A slip lead allows you to avoid touching your dog’s neck. Another option that’s similar but doesn’t open up as wide is a front attach harness with a leash already attached. You can work on training your dog to be comfortable with either by putting the loop over your arm and a really high value treat, or ideally a spoon with peanut butter on it and then slowly put the loop over the dog’s head. If you do use a front-attach harness you have to be careful not to pinch hair in it as you buckle it. You’d also want to use positive reinforcement to get your dog comfortable with her collar being touched. 

The other option is to put a short drag line on your dog, something without a handle to tangle in stuff and just leave it on for now. Meanwhile you counter-condition the leash to be something good.  Get your dog comfortable with you touching the collar, you’d want to pair a word with it, like “collar.” If your dog is ok with that start attaching a leash clip without the leash attached and use another word like “clip”. You can find them at hardware stores. Meanwhile leave the leash on the ground and place treats on it off and on and walk away. Then start leaving treats and see if your dog is ok with you still standing there. Then touch the leash and set a treat nearby, then pick the leash up and leave a treat, then hand your dog a treat. Pair a word with picking the leash up. Then start touching the collar with your other hand with the leash in your hand saying “collar.” Then put it all together. Be sure to keep it broken down into each step with a treat for each one “leash,” “collar,” “clip.” Then you can eventually start randomly giving praise instead of a treat for one of the commands and slowly work towards only giving a treat after all 3 steps. Be sure to also say “collar” when you reach down to unclip the leash after the walk. 

The more you can keep doing training, whether it’s training tricks or agility obstacles or obedience tasks, the more your dog will become confident.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/x0a345/i_got_my_new_friend_today_but_hear_me_out_i_dont/#im7adkc,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I know you want to give your dog everything, to let her explore and have fun. However, I would very strongly advise and caution you to go even slower. I'd also read up even more on dog body language: sometimes anxiety can look like excitement. For instance, it can be easy to confuse a dog who's stress panting with a dog who's happily/excitedly panting, especially if you *expect* them to be excited and happy. If your dog is timid and shy or comes from someone who abused or caused her to be afraid, she's actually likely going to feel the most loved, safe, and respected if you let her opt out of the things she'll (eventually) find fun, but might still find scary. There will be many years for fun and exploring.

How long have you had her? Have you heard of the rule of 3s for rescue dogs? Has she had the proper time to decompress? If your dog is fearful and anxious -- and it sounds like she is -- I would be pseudo aggressive about advocating for her, which in this case, means making her life as ""boring"" and predictable as possible. You can immediately start working confidence-building games... at her pace.

Confidence and bond building games can look like a lot of things and is very dog-dependent. I'd first makes sure she's had a proper decompression period. Then, I'd try to figure out what your dog finds the most motivating: food? special types of food? tug? chasing balls? chasing you? being chased? prey animals? squeaky toys? plush toys? ripping out stuffing? ripping up boxes? jumping? dragging things around? digging? sprinting? wrestling? playing with other dogs? playing with other kids? sniffing? It might actually takes months for her to come out of her shell enough to show you what she actually likes, but I'd play around and try. If nothing works, just spend time/hours in the same room as her. Ignore her, don't make eye contact or attempt to engage her. Occasionally throw some treats her way. Let her come to you if she wants to, but don't go to her.

Sniffing is naturally stress-reducing to dogs, and fun. You can implement this in many ways... dinner in a snuffle mat. dinner bowl hidden in progressively harder spots. Treats hidden. 

Have you seen the [""101 things to do with a box""](https://www.clickertraining.com/101-things-to-do-with-a-box)? It could be a great start!

My favorite confidence builders for my dog were a mix of scent training and puzzle games with built-in, pseudo parkour. It was very important that I *always* allowed him to do *anything* during this time. I have never allowed myself to show or feel any sort of anxiety/frustration/etc (ie my dog never jumps up on tables, but if he jumps on top of it mid-game my job is to be his cheerleader in whatever way he needs), nor to tell my dog not to do something (ie I will calmly/happily ask him to explore a different area if he just broke or is about to break my favorite XYZ thing by accident). In the very beginning, this looked like placing a treat inside the room he was in a foot away from us both, and telling him to ""go find"". He was so anxious and unsure of what he was allowed to do that this was challenging! We built on this to hiding treats, using puzzle toys, then combining them. We also did more traditional scent games by using 2-3 plastic cups placed upside down, one with a treat under it, and asking him to ""find it"". We further set up 'equipment' in the apartment for at-home 'agility'/parkour. This doesn't have look fancy -- it just has to be kind of silly, child play style. Like hide under a blanket, and ask her to find you. Or make a blanket fort (yes, seriously!), and ask her to come in to steal a treat (or just chill and read in there). Place a blanket over two chairs or over an entryway in your house. Just silly things that won't frighten her (! if it does -- take a step back or try again with something smaller the next day), but will make her pause a second, then feel good about sniffing/investigating and seeing that it's safe.

Also, I'll emphasize again the boring and predictable life schedule. If nothing else, ensure her walks, mealtime, and your own routine is consistent as possible every day for at least the first couple weeks. Predictability can really help reduce anxiety.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/x0a345/i_got_my_new_friend_today_but_hear_me_out_i_dont/#im7bvc4,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You could just keep the leash on all the time in the house for a few days too. If you just got the dog, it may be acting unusual because she's decompressing.

"My 13 yr old ACD/Shepard mix’s whining is getting out of control.
Hello everyone,

My wife and I are getting to the end of our leash on this issue, and it is a really tough one to google since I feel that this situation is relatively unique. We have a 13 year old dog who has been blind (Glaucoma) since she was around 8. She has always been very food motivated and relatively vocal, but her behavior has taken a turn for the worse since she lost her hearing about 3-4 months ago. 

Generally, she is a happy dog who likes to keep to herself but will enjoy a walk, a pet, playing with a toy, or just strolling around the back yard. However, she has become increasingly demanding at meal and snack times, and increasing inaccurate concerning when those occur. She has a full feeding schedule of a meal at 7a, a bone health treat at noon, a meal at 4pm, and then a final meal at 9pm with a dental treat before we go upstairs. She is a healthy weight and our vet has signed off the diet and feeding amounts. She gets at least one walk per day, these days, as she is getting older and can’t handle the same amount of exercise without getting sore. She has also been on dementia medication on the advice of our vet for 3 months. We are not entirely convinced she has that ailment, as her behavior has not changed even with some adjustment in the dosage.

The issues: She has started to whine noisily up to 2 hours before each of the snack/meal times, which crescendos with very loud BARK!s when she has decided she has waited long enough. Most importantly, my wife and I have a 3 month old baby that is awoken by said BARK!s. 

Our dog is a wonderful, gentle companion and we love her very much, but this change in her behavior is adding an incredible amount of stress to our lives. We have googled and made vet appointments, etc, but most of the time what we hear is, “Yeah, haha, old dogs just whine, doesn’t it suck?!”

,"You could try spacing out food a bit more? That’s my only advice. And lots of patience. She’s blind and has lost her hearing, that’s a tough call for a human let alone a dog that doesn’t understand much. If it’s the only thing she can really really enjoy.. why not spread the food out a bit and see if that helps. 

One of the common side effects of dementia is increased appetite. It could be she’s forgotten she’s eaten and is reminding you with the barks. Anxiety also increases appetites.  

Patience, love.. and yeah.. maybe just give her a bit more food and spread it out a bit more. And watch for her condition worsening. 

I’m sorry OP, this isn’t a fun thing to go thru and I feel for you with all the cards on your table. Just remember you love her.

,"Dementia meds doesn't reverse the damage already done to the brain. And it really isn't that effective. 

As your dog is blind due to glaucoma (which often causes discomfort) and deaf their world is limited to odour and touch. 

You have also introduced a baby into their life - imagine if your dog was your grandparent that lived with you and they had dementia and arthritis and were deaf and blind and spoke a different language to you. I think they would have a hard time dealing with all the change and not knowing what was happening. 

Also your dog will be getting less attention because you have a new born. 

Please, please start thinking very carefully about your dogs quality of life. Also have your dog checked for any arthritis related pain. 

Dogs can be incredibly miserable but still look happy about food so please do not think that your dog being happy to eat or demanding food early means that their life is good.

I am a firm believer of better a week to early than a day too late. I know it would be hard to do with a new baby - but can you and your wife take some time to have a really hard look at your dogs quality of life (you can find some quality of life evaluation charts on line). Look also at what your life is going to be like innthe next weeks and months - knowing that your dog is going to become more and more disoriented as time goes on. 

You may be able to plan some time when you each take your dog out and do a favourite activity that they can still do as a mini bucket list, or just organise for an at home euthanasia (if available in your area) and spoil your dog for a morning then have the vet come.

,"My first thought when I read the first paragraph was dementia. Did the vet say anything about whether you would see a reversal? Normally dementia medication is about stopping it getting worse rather than undoing the damage. AFAIK you can't undo the damage that already has caused the confusion but I am not a vet.

Did this start before or after the baby? A baby coming into the house changes the smells and routines, just because the dog has the same routine doesn't mean it isn't sensitive to other changes. This would be particularly hard for a dog with dementia.

Have you tried distraction techniques? So think sustained rewarding activities not compatible with whining or barking for food.

"How to get my dogs to stop peeing inside the house?
I recently adopted my grandma's two chihuahuas when she went in a home for dementia. She had bee lax in letting them outside due to the dementia, and they got in the habit of going the bathroom inside. 

We've had them six months and it was bad at first. They've started to realize they can go out frequently, so the ""accidents"" have become less frequent (maybe once a week). I assumed at first that once they got acclimated, it would stop. Not yet at least. 

I reward them heavily when they got outside. My larger dog goes outside exclusively. I knew it's them and not my other dog, because he's 100 lbs and they're less than 15 lbs, so the quantity is a dead giveaway. 

I also don't know which one of them (or both) is doing it because I never catch them. They always hide it and we find it later. They're 6-7 so it's not like there puppies, and they didn't do this before my grandma's dementia got really bad.

"How can I keep my new puppy from eating my free-feeding cats' food?
My cats are free-feeding. I have one cat who is 2 years old who could possibly be transitioned to scheduled feeding and one cat that is 21 years old who can't transition to scheduled feeding. They've both been free-fed their whole lives and are good at maintaining their weight on their own.

I'm getting a puppy who will be trained to become my service dog and I'm not sure what to do about separating the cat food from the puppy. The pup will be hand fed through training and will also have scheduled feeding times. I'm worried that the cat food will interfere with her training. 

I think the best way to keep the pup from eating the cat food is to elevate the cats' bowl out of reach, but my 21 year old cat will have a problem getting to something that high off the ground. He's also suffering from dementia and we're worried that he could try to jump off and hurt himself.

,"I’d get a baby gate (depending on the size of the puppy, you could look at one that has gaps wide enough that the cats can squeeze between the bars, but the puppy can’t).  Have a room, or even end of the house, that is the cats domain that puppy can’t get into. 

I’d pick a comfy room (bedroom or office with couch etc), and make sure that there’s not only food and water, but a couple of comfy places for your cats to hang out when they want to be away from puppy. Because whilst your younger cat will probably be ok with the puppy a 21yo cat is less likely to be wanting to make nice, and will want space to get away safely.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ul9cx4/how_can_i_keep_my_new_puppy_from_eating_my/#i7u70is,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"We started by putting the cat food up on the table instead..she likes to hang out up there in the sun anyways so it worked, and would put it back down if we had the pup outside or at night since she is crated. Once we started training ‘leave it’ it became a great tool. She’s never allowed to have it, so leave it works well with that over a random treat. 

She will still steal a quick bite randomly, maybe 1x every week or 10 days, but has been mainly just laying there a few feet away dreaming that it was her food, or watching the cat eat it.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ul9cx4/how_can_i_keep_my_new_puppy_from_eating_my/#i7v51ji,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Senior dog taking a long time to go pee
We have 3 corgis. The one I'm concerned about is an 11 year old female. Within the last week, she's started taking forever to go pee in the morning. She goes poop just fine. I walk her and my other two around our acre of property every morning and have done so for years and there was never really any issue before. We live in the country and can't afford a fence, though we're working on it. We have neighbors that are related to each other and their properties are across ftom each other (one uphill and one downhill), and both let their dogs roam free. On occasion their dogs come in our yard and drive my dogs bonkers. Their two properties are downhill at an angle where you cant see their dogs approaching our yard until they're already in our yard. Asking the neighbors to keep their dogs out our yard is out of the question as my neighbors are sketchy people with teenagers that are little shits and we're not willing to deal with crap ftom them. Last week I went to take my dogs out and slipped on our front steps and in the process, two of my dogs leashes (one being the 11 year old girl) slipped off my wrist. Normally they're very good about not running off but that day just so happened to be a day where our neighbors dogs showed up out of nowhere and my dogs chased after them. I got my dogs back fairly quickly. Ever since then, I feel like my senior dog spends a good chunk of time looking in the directions that their dogs have entered our yard from (their dogs walk through a few different yards so they've entered our property from several areas so there isn't really a spot I van take her where she won't look for the dogs). It's gotten to the point where I've been getting up so instead of taking 15 outside in the morning its taking 25 minutes and I can only get her to pee half the time. My husband goes to work about 30 minutes after  me so he's been taking her out when she hasn't peed for me. She's fine about 50% of the time and goes pretty quickly in the afternoon, only seeming distracted sometimes and she goes perfectly at night (I'm guessing this is because it's dark so she can't see the perimeter of our property). She's eating and drinking like normal and playing like normal. She's not whining when she pees, goes the normal amount. I even took a puppy pad out with us to be able to look at her urine and it's the normal color (no blood or anything like that, doesn't smell worse than normal).She's not having accidents inside and behaving normally. She gets her shots and yearly blood workand looks great for her age. She does take Prozac for anxiety, gabapentin for nerve pain in her front leg,  and carprofen and glucosamine for hip dysplasia as well as a daily multivitamin. She's taken all those for years except gabapentin which she started in February. Is this just her being distracted? Is this possible beginnings of dog dementia? Could this possibly be a bladder/kidney problem? We'll happily take her to the vet if needed but before we have to drop a bunch of money for tests I'd like to get some outside perspective. I'll answer any questions if anyone has any. Thank you for your time and have a great day.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/140vrwi/senior_dog_taking_a_long_time_to_go_pee/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"To those with cats and dogs: does a dog shaking a toy spell trouble for my cats?
Hello! If this sounds like a rookie question, it’s because that’s what I am. First time dog owner, long time cat owner. A little background in case it’s helpful: I took on an adorable and affectionate 5-year-old, 55 pound whippet/staffy mix about a month ago. He has been doing great with training which seems to be a refresher since he seems to know some basic stuff and sleeps through the night “gated”  in the kitchen. The dog lived with cats peacefully with the previous owner, my best friend’s mom who has dementia and doesn’t remember having the dog. 

I have 3 cats. I am taking it really slow, keeping the dog separated from the cats by baby gates. Two of the three cats still hiss and/or hide. The 3rd is pretty chill but keeps his distance. If the dog hears the cats he brings his toys to the gate, wags his whole hind end, and will whine and sometimes bark (doesn’t sound aggressive and it’s usually just once). I’ve done scent swapping and I have also taken him to the “cat room” on a short leash with a stuffed Kong toy and he doesn’t pay them any attention with his Kong treat.

This evening the dog and I were playing outside with a rope toy that he has previously only fetched or used for tug of war.  Tonight he began shaking it. I know this is natural prey drive. 

I started to panic a little. Should I be worried that this spells trouble for my cats? Should I just put this toy away and not encourage this kind of play? I have really bonded with this dog but my cats were here first…

Any advice would be so appreciated!",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/yizv05/to_those_with_cats_and_dogs_does_a_dog_shaking_a/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I'm no dog expert (we've had our 7 month old Lab/Boxer/Shepherd mix for 5 months, my first dog since I was a teenager at home) but I have 2 10-year old cats and the above very energetic pup. Based on my own experience, you have nothing to fear. Our dog will try to play with the cats and will sometimes bark and approach them excitedly but even when she's very close to the cats she'll never hurt them. One thing we've done a lot of is to teach her ""gentle"" and ""kisses"" rather than nipping, so when she's near the cats we'll remind her of those things. If things get too intense and we're afraid she'll hurt them accidentally, we'll give her cool off time in her crate for 15 minutes or so with a chew toy. She also has toys that she'll shake when she's playing and she loves tug of war, but she's never tried to harm the cats. 

Don't know if this helps. Maybe others with more experience can weigh in.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/yizv05/to_those_with_cats_and_dogs_does_a_dog_shaking_a/#iuoj93m,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I have an adult blind cat.  The 65 lb adolescent mutt doesn't bother her at all because she doesn't act like prey.

The other 2 cats run away and the dog chases them, but the blind one, hangs out in her favorite little hiding places just like she did before our lives were invaded by this puppy.

My recommendation is to stay vigilent, don't worry, but know that the cats will certainly put up more resistance than the rope toy!  Provide the cats lots of options to escape up or under.  My dog loves to destroy plush toys, chew them open,  pull the stuffing out, shake them wildly.

"how do I get my dog to stop snapping?
TLDR: deaf & dementia dog forgets the rules, how train now? Is it possible?    

Ok so. She's 14, almost 15 and never snapped before. She's very well trained, up until recently. Never begged for food, waited for permission to eat ANYTHING (if not directly put in her bowl) never had food aggression, anything. But recently she's been diagnosed with dementia & I thought for a few years she might be losing her hearing, but it's clear now she's deaf. Now when she gets treats or if you're eating & go to push her away, she snaps at hands thinking foods in there. She's not aggressive when doing so but she's never been allowed to take anything like that & while not aggressive she does bite hard if/when she makes contact. (Then immediately apologizing with licks) Normally we'd say ""nice"" & she'd take her treats ever so softly. That was trained into her but usually she was always pretty careful when taking food anyway, but on those occasions she was excited, nice seemed to work. But now she can't hear. It seems she's forgotten her hand signals completely too, so I'm not sure what to do. Is there a way to break thru to her now? I can always put treat in her bowl before she comes in & stop hand feeding her the treats, but I've noticed since she's stopped hearing she's more cuddly/needs more contact (maybe since she can't hear praise, seeks it out that way?) I dunno. Anyway. If anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it. She's such a good dog & it's just ... Well. It's like a different dog has taken her spot these past few months. It's weird. But when she was diagnosed we were kinda like ""some of that (symptoms).fit but she's not that bad""...that was about 3 months ago. The last couple of weeks have just tumbled one thing into another to the point where it seems like all the symptoms fit & it's not a 'once in a while she does xx' it's all the time. :( Anyway. If anyone has some advice please lmk. Also before anyone asks. Yes she has a vet. She's on meds for the anxiety part of the dementia, and sees vet regularly, but this is something that's popped up & becoming more of an issue lately so if I can get advice before our next vet visit, that'd be great, but yes it is something I'll definitely be bringing up with her vet at next Apt",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/x685wh/how_do_i_get_my_dog_to_stop_snapping/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Sudden Separation Anxiety in 12 year old Poodle
Looking for advice on dealing with increased anxiety in my dog.  This is mostly separation anxiety, sometimes just caused by sleep, also anxiety dealing with thunderstorms (which isn't new but now more severe possibly because my new apartment doesn't have as good of a hiding place as my old one).  This mostly is in the form of excessive howling.  Note he is crate trained and he's been in the crate most times when I leave, largely because once when he was first adopted he tried to dig out the door and basically destroyed it and his nails.  As an apartment dweller I do worry about neighbors making noise complaints and I obviously can't be home 24/7.

I've tried giving him melatonin for when I know I am going to be gone for an extended period of time and it helps a bit but he will allegedly (according to my neighbors) still howl for around 10 minutes and will be softly whining after that).  I've also tried retraining him a bit but it doesn't seem to help.  I haven't tried leaving him out of the crate but giving his childhood history as well as his history of mischief when not watched (let's just say he loves the taste of socks) that doesn't seem like the best idea.

I've looked up doggy dementia as he is getting up there in years and that doesn't seem to fit as the anxiety is the only symptom that remotely matches.  At times I think he has decreased hearing but he has always had a bit of selective heading so hard to say.  I am trying to give him a bit more exercise but being 12 with arthritis and valley fever that metastasized to his left front knee makes that hard (he used to be able to exercise a lot though).

I don’t know who to ask anymore because everyone keeps telling me the same thing but it’s not working when it comes to my grandma. 

so my dog is a rescue, he’s 9 months old and german shepherd & pomeranian mix: with the rest of my family he’s very sweet, especially with me, although he still needs to learn that when he plays, his bites can hurt people lol. and yes, we ignore him when he’s a little to rough. he’s probably still getting used to everything, it’s only been almost three months…

we also keep reminding my grandma (should i mention she has dementia? i don’t know if it’s a trivial info) to ignore him so when he feels comfortable he can go to her… but there were these three times when he tried to bite her. the latest one especially: he was sleeping on my bed while i was speaking at the door with my grandma, he probably got startled and jumped to the door and growled at my grandma but i think he realized it was her(?) and got back to where he was sleeping.

"Deaf disabled senior pug is holding house hostage.
I have a 13 and a half year old female pug who doesn’t have use of her back legs and uses a wheel chair. She also recently went deaf. 

Piper barks A LOT. Specifically around food. She eats at about 9:30 in the morning and eats dinner at 9:30pm. She also gets medication at about 1:30 am (it’s just how it’s spaced out, we sleep late). Recently she’s been demanding her food and meds a good hour or more in advance. And she honestly won’t stop no matter what we do. She will just continuously bark for an hour if we don’t somehow force her to lie down or distract her the whole time by petting her (once you stop she immediately starts panting and barking). And the barking is also frantic sometimes, she’ll try to scratch at you, drag herself to the edge of the bed or couch and if she sees you move your legs she freaks out. 

This behaviour is effecting the house’s sleep and our ability to really do anything around those times. Sometimes we give in and give her her meds or breakfast a half hour early, but a lot of time it just makes it worse and she’ll try to get them even earlier the next day. Once she gets her breakfast or medication, she goes back to sleep and calms down. Sometimes if I make her go to the bathroom (she needs to be expressed) it distracts her long enough that she waits the full hour without barking. For some reason. 

She does demand us to do other things for her, which is reasonable since she can’t do them herself anymore, but these times specifically are stressful and becoming a big problem. 

So my question is, does anyone have any tips? Or maybe better ways to distract her for the hour or so? Even if she’s put in her wheels downstairs, she’ll just bark in her wheels once she’s done her walk about.

*UPDATE*

We brought her to the vet and she was diagnosed with sundowners and canine cognitive dysfunction, she is being given selegiline for her brain (it can slow/stop progression in some) and is being given trazodone for sleep. Also the vet is getting her a bunch of brain supplements like MCT, omega 3 and antioxidant blend. 
Thank you everyone for your tips, we’re going to give her more meals throughout the day, give her something to do before her meds at night and make sure she doesn’t have to go the bathroom.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/10oh2ug/deaf_disabled_senior_pug_is_holding_house_hostage/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"So I’m wondering if she needs to go to the bathroom. You say that you need to express her bladder, she can’t go on her own. And that if you express her bladder, it “distracts” her long enough that she stops barking. “For some reason.” How long are you having her wait between expressing her bladder? Especially in the morning?

Now on a semi-related issue, as someone who just recently put their ancient cat with multiple issues to sleep, I wonder if Piper is really all that happy? The barking is her trying to tell you that she wants something or is not getting something she needs. It sounds like she is feeling that way a lot more lately. I’m not in your house, I can’t tell you what the right answer is, and I’m not telling you to euthanize her tomorrow. BUT, I saw my cat deteriorate rapidly in a day because she was metaphorically being held together with toothpicks and chewing gum and I missed one dose of her medication that she was dependent on for an essential bodily function. I don’t ever want to be in that situation again. Where my pet completely depends on me and medication to do the things they are supposed to be able to do on their own. And my last memory is of her body completely shutting down because I was convinced that keeping her alive was more important than her being happy.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/10oh2ug/deaf_disabled_senior_pug_is_holding_house_hostage/#j6eukyx,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Doglang: An Artificial Language for Dog Commands
Hi everyone! I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.


For anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).


My language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.


Here are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):

SINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)

Command | Pronunciation | Spelling
:--|:--:|:--:
focus/watch me | vaʊ | vow
sit | ler | lare
down | gel | gale
off (of person) | dev | dayv
off (of object) | dez | dayz
leave it | daɪz | dize
wait | baɪ | by

TWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)

Command | Pronunciation | Spelling
:--|:--:|:--:
focus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow
sit | el.ler | alelare
down | il.gel | eelgale
off (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv
off (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz
leave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize
wait | ger.baɪ | gareby

PRONUNCIATION

Symbol | Example
:--|:--
b | **b**est
d | **d**ea**d**
g | **g**ot
l | **l**ean
m | **m**other
n | **n**eed
r | **r**ed
v | **v**iolin
z | **z**ebra
aɪ | m**i**ne
aʊ | c**o**w
e | **ei**ght
i | thr**ee**
o | **o**ver
u | bl**ue**


You might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).


The single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:

1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere
2. to further differentiate the command from others


At this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.


Any feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.

I’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Interesting idea. I think my main reservation in using something like this would just be ease of use for others. If I have someone pet sit or bring him to a daycare/boarding, I don't think I can expect someone to learn this. 

Id also be curious to see if this actually works better (like in a study or a real life example) because right now it seems like most dogs can learn commands in english well enough. 

Also curious why the words for the commands seem random. You could use ""down"" for down since you have all the sounds, but instead it's gale. It might be easier if the words sounded closer to their english counterparts when possible to learn.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/#hfdlbwa,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Some thoughts:

- few people will want to memorise long lists of arbitrary words for cues, when coopting existing words in daily language will come more naturally to most, especially if they [will be interacting with their dogs in a more casual verbal sense](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/3rkkvv/positively_no_cue_november/)  
- on a similar note, your idea isn't very compatible with the current interest in AAC buttons that allow non-family members to equally communicate with dogs as the owners do https://www.hungerforwords.com/our-story/  
- uptake of your proposed cue combination structure may be limited by existing expectations. For example, obedience competition rules in my area include the following, where some of your more extensive combination options may well be interpreted as a disqualifying multi-word structure: 

> All verbal commands must be in the English Language unless approved otherwise by the Judge.  
> One command only is given to the dog for a specific action on the part of the dog. The verbal command
must be a single word. 

- a tiered system might be worth considering. e.g. an ultra-simplified chart for regular dog owners to evaluate which of their existing English word choices are hardest for dogs to pick up and how to select words with more sound clarity, and then expect the full language concept to only be of deep interest to the very few intense nerds out there globally",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/#hfg1c04,,,,,,,,,,,,
"16+ Yo dog started barking constantly
I have a 16/17 year old Cavalier who has recently taken up suddenly jumping up from his bed, running outside or to the door and barking.

The barking only last for about 5-10 seconds before he stops and comes back - but its constant all day.

This is completely new behaviour for him and I cannot work out whats causing it (maybe senility?) or how to stop it.

I follow him out and as soon as he see's me it stops, he wags his tail and trots happily inside.
I have tried treating him for coming to me.
I have tried catching him as I see him spring up - but am rarely quick enough to stop it.

Things to note:
- He is virtually entirely deaf, so I cannot *call him* to stop him. He cannot hear me.
- He is partially blind, however my 5 month old puppy has been licking the adult dogs face. The vet said this has been appearing to help my older dogs eyesight a little.
- He has also gotten more reactive on walks. He used to do a low under-his-breath growl at other dogs. Now it's a full blown barking fit. I have been taking treats with me because of this and when it starts I get his focus on me, ask him to sit, and then treat him and it stops.
- His recent check up said he was in perfect health (other than his known issues with hearing, sight and a little arthritis).

Any advice on how I could manage the constant sudden barking would be appreciated.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/u49joo/16_yo_dog_started_barking_constantly/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Advice for hurt dog
I have a 12 year old chihuahua who has been in pain for about two months and I cannot figure out what's wrong. I'm praying someone on here may have seen a similar case and can help figure this out. I have taken him to two different vets multiple times and they can not figure out what's wrong. He got blood tests and x rays and everything came back normal... hes gotten pain meds and muscle relaxants - they seem to help only to a small extent. 

He's been showing signs of pain - he will randomly yell out in pain. Sometimes he yells when I touch him, sometimes when he's picked up, sometimes when he's walking, sometimes when he's standing, sometimes when he's laying down.... when the vet was examining his back, he did yelp when she pushed on a certain spot, but nothing showed up in the X-rays. He has difficulty walking most of the time, but will then randomly seem fine and run around at other times. He can't walk down stairs easily anymore. His back legs seem to be giving him trouble, and he'll sometimes stand with them crossed over each other. He doesn't do much moving anymore, he spends most of the day just lying in his bed. He'll usually only get up if I put food out, otherwise I have to pick him up for him to get out of bed. He's eating and drinking fine, but not going to the bathroom as much (he used to pee on everything outside when we took walks) and no longer lifts his legs to pee. 

He seems pretty disoriented a lot of the time, and has even gotten stuck under kitchen chairs or behind doors. He gets scared very easily now and seems jumpy. He's shivering a lot now.

Lately, he's been really worrying me because he will start yelping in his bed, look as if he can't move, and start peeing in his bed. This is very unlike him - he'd never pee in our room, let alone his bed before. He usually won't let me touch him during this, and his yelping will last about 20 seconds. Afterward, he struggles to move or get comfortable. 

Like I said, this has been going on for about two months (started very shortly after he had swollen anal glands expressed at the vet and took antibiotics). Before he started having this pain two months ago, he was COMPLETELY fine. He'd run around, jump on couches, chase toys, and acted like a puppy. He had no symptoms of pain whatsoever, and then all of this hit so suddenly. 

If you have any idea what this could be, please respond. I'd really appreciate any insight or suggestions! Thanks!

"Curious: Do you use aromatherapy on your dog?
My dog's become more territorial and reactive/lunge-y at strangers and dogs over the past week, so we're going back to basics. As I was re-reading the reactive guidebook my old dog trainer gave me half a year ago, I noticed the list of ""calming"" elements she indicated could work on some dogs. List of the options are below. (Apologies for crappy formatting in the list -- I'm copy/pasting it from a PDF.)

Does anyone have experience with any of them? Do you recommend any of them, in addition to the usual clicker training/positive reinforcement/lots of exercise? I'm particularly curious about the DAP collar, Chillout spray, and Bach Flower Essences.

LIST:

D.A.P. Collar
-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults
dogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of
medication.
-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.
-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for
separation distress.

Chillout - Aromatherapy for Pets
-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.
-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt

Bach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy
-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings

Through A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com
-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.
-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of
guests.

Essential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com
-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt

Composure
-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.
-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine
supports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to
produce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.

Anxitane
-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.
-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.

Valerian Root:
-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.
-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals. Its central nervous system effects are thought to be associated with an action on the
inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Valerian is also said to have antispasmodic properties.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/3nb8nu/curious_do_you_use_aromatherapy_on_your_dog/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I've had mixed success with DAP. I used to use the infuser and collar (at the same time) during the spring/summer for thunderstorms. It was okay. My dog didn't react to the smaller thunder rumbles as often, but it definitely didn't improve his behavior enough to allow me to work on his anxiety.

I had better success with these melatonin treats I found. Still didn't work as well as advertised, but if I gave it to him at the perfect time (roughly 1-2 hours before the storm, no sooner or later) he slept through a decent amount of storms, depending on their severity.

For reactivity though, since this is retraining, *maybe* you'd do okay with some of the other natural options, but I would just talk to a vet/vet behaviorist about medication. IMO, with something that can get worse with time, such as reactivity, I wouldn't want to risk those things failing me.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/3nb8nu/curious_do_you_use_aromatherapy_on_your_dog/#cvmn6cx,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sudden confusion during training
Hello! I have a 12yo toy poodle (male neutered). I'll admit that his training has been a bit spotty over the years I've had him, but for the last few months, he's had to 'work' for everything he gets, and we usually spend about 20 minutes training during his breakfast, and then another 20 in the evenings for dinner. At first, I just started with reinforcing the commands he already knew (sit, stay, lie down), but now I've been working on a couple of new 'tricks' - when I say 'touch', he has to touch a red ball on the end of a stick with his nose, and when I say 'squiggly', he has to squeak his stuffed octopus toy (named 'Mr Squiggly'). I've been using a clicker with him for the last two years, btw, but I'd like to work up to trying 'do as I do'.

So here's the issue: he seems to get confused sometimes in the middle of training sessions. I mean, sometimes we have 'bad days' where no matter what I ask for, he'll just cycle through all the things he knows and then whine when I don't respond (because he didn't do the thing I asked for), but this is a more sudden confusion. This morning, for example, I was working on reinforcing 'squiggly' with him, because he's only been working on it for a week and I didn't want to introduce anything new. So we had about fifteen minutes where he HAD 'squiggly', like he clearly knew to go over to the toy, and he knew that he wouldn't get clicked unless he squeaked it, and if he started doing the thing where he would just go over and squeak it without being asked, I would make him sit and *then* do 'squiggly'. Then all of a sudden, it was like he'd never learned 'squiggly' in the first place - when I gave the command, he wouldn't even look at the toy. So I brought the toy closer to me, and eventually he started touching it when I said 'squiggly', but he seemed to have forgotten that he had to squeak it. So I squeaked it myself, clicked, and gave him his last kibble.

As dogs go, he's a bit of a contradiction - I brought him to the vet about a month ago because he'd become unpredictably bitey with me and my partner (thankfully not with anyone else), and she suggested it might be canine cognitive dysfunction and put him on Vivitonin. But, aside from the biteyness (and we haven't had a biting incident since he started the medicine), he doesn't really display any other symptoms - no confusion, wandering around, waking up in the night, staring into corners - that sort of thing. So I don't *think* his training confusion is related to that, I think I'm just doing something wrong.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Sorry for the long post and thanks!",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1zpghm/sudden_confusion_during_training/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"If you don't think it's a health issue. My first suggestion is that your training sessions are far too long. An ideal training session should be no more than 5-10 minutes. You can do several of them but dogs have short attention spans so it's better to do multiple short sessions rather than one long session. Yes you can force them to work longer but you're not going to get the best out of them. On top of that I would never do the full session on just one trick. I tend to go with ~5 or so repetitions and then moving on to something different. I know it seems counter-intuitive but I find dogs learn better if you keep it short and sweet and then move on to something else and give them a chance to think about it.

Dogs get bored, for some this results in them playing up and being naughty, for others (like yours and mine) if you go too long they seem almost seem to forget the trick. ",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1zpghm/sudden_confusion_during_training/#cfwld5o,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Help for senior Jack Russell with sudden separation anxiety (cross-post from AskVet)
I have two senior Jack Russells who are 12.5 years old. Gus has suddenly developed severe separation anxiety and goes CRAZY when I leave the house--loudly vocalizing, pacing, panting, trying to escape the gated-in kitchen area. It just started about a month ago, and has gotten to such a level that I feel like I can never leave my house. I teach, so my schedule is very laid-back in the summer and more rigorous when school starts (about now). So I HAVE to find some answers. Some quick background on Gus's medical condition:

--he has arthritis and was on anti-inflammatories (Metacam, then Deramax) and had back GI issues that led to irritable bowel. He's now off the meds, but to help with the IBS, I also transitioned him from a duck and sweet potato food to a duck grain free food. It's high protein and I'd say he's been on it for a few months. I read that high protein can sometimes cause anxiety. Is this true?

--because he can't take NSAIDs for arthritis, he's on 25mg 2x/day of Tramadol for pain. I've read that sometimes Tramadol can negatively effect a dog with canine cognitive disorder, which his litter mate did develop. (the other dog is now on a variety of supplements, which has almost taken the symptoms away). Could a similar thing be happening to Gus? Other meds Gus takes: --Carafate (once at night for GI coating) --1/2 Pepcid with meals (to settle IBS stomach) --25 mgs of Tramadol 2x/day --3mg melatonin (which I thought would help calm him but hasn't)

Xanax (which I tried, b/c my other dog had it and they're the same age/breed/weight, etc) only made him MORE hyper, but maybe because he was already amped up when I gave it to him. I also tried a Thundershirt (with the suggested gradual training) and it only made his cry a bit quieter. Not really helpful and not something I feel comfortable leaving him in for 6-7 hours.

And Gus does appear anxious at other times, too, though the anxiety is worst when I leave. But even when I'm making dinner or cleaning (anytime I'm not sitting next to him) he'll stand and cry. After a while he will go lie down, but it takes a while. He cries in the car too, and anytime something happens he doesn't expect. He does get exercise every day--several shorter walks because of his arthritis.

So what can I do!? Medications? I tried behavioral work, but feel like I need something else to go along with those modifications. Should I change foods? Supplements that work? I'm afraid he's going to harm himself or have a heart attack because he's SO anxious and stressed for hours when I'm gone. Plus I feel trapped.

Thanks in advance for help!

"My dog won't stop eating the cats food and it's affecting his health
Hi all. So my dog is 10 years old and for the past half a year I'd say he's been constantly going after our cats food. Every single day, he would whine at the cat's food bowl even if my cat is actively eating it just so he can have it all. This has been driving me crazy and I blame my Dad for this since he started giving the cats food to him months ago when he was having issues with his food and he hasn't bothered to stop it since, he just keeps giving him it. He would whine at it even when it's not up there just to tell us he can have some more food. I'm at my wits end and I even gave in and started handing it to him because I chalked it up to not being to get a dog out of a habit when they're old enough. This was until recently, when his skin started to get flaky. I know I need to get him off of it so any help that I can get would be massively appreciated.

For context, I've tried ignoring his barks and whines when begging for the food but he goes on for hours on end and we have noise complaints already from our neighbours about him. I've tried dragging him away from it but no matter how far I take him he goes right back to it and I've even tried locking the kitchen door but that doesn't help.

EDIT: Thanks all for the replies. For those who keep commenting to put the cat food bowl up higher, it's on a windowsill in the kitchen where the dog can't reach normally. It was just the issue that my Dad gave him the bowl months ago and now he only wants the cat food.

"My mental health is destroyed. Is my puppy ok?
I’m having a really hard time with my 8 month old (mostly) husky shepherd and not only is it really affecting our bond but it’s destroyed my mental health.

Disclaimer: this post is long but I can’t afford therapy so my next best option is to vent and spill my guts here in hopes of connecting with other pup owners who can commiserate, provide helpful, kind advice, or simply validate my struggles. If you read through it, you’re a real one and I appreciate it!

I got my pup at 7-ish weeks and we had a less-than-healthy start to life (him, his mom and littermates all got out of the house twice in one day and when they were found only 9 of 11 pups were found so who knows what happened to the others…).

He showed signs of anxiety as soon as I brought him home but everyone convinced me it was normal. Of course, he consumed my life (which I was prepared for) and I spent every day trying to figure out a routine that made him happy but he was always so sensitive and would tip over threshold so easy and get really agitated and bite me a LOT. This slowly chipped away at my mental health but my perspective was that I chose to get him, he was my responsibility and I had to suck it up and deal with everything that came with it.

When he was 5 months, we moved across the country and started living with my sister who quickly became his secondary caregiver. As time went on, I had an easier time dealing with his energy, providing him with a stable routine, and managing his arousal levels but he would often be over threshold with her, regardless of what she tried. Still nothing was anywhere near perfect and struggling to figure out how to best meet his needs continued to chip away at my mental health.

We just moved again a month ago and since we got to this new place (and he’s moved into adolescence) it’s been so difficult caring for him. If he’s awake, and not engaged in training or on a walk, he’s exhibiting stress cues. He’s almost always panting, pacing, drooling, whining. He can’t seem to settle and I feel like we’ve tried everything!

We take him on a hike every morning where he’s on his long lead and gets to sniff to his heart’s content. We’ve experimented with more and less exercise and the results have been very inconsistent. He gets plenty of mental stimulation. We’ve experimented with different types, leaning into his natural breed instincts, and nothing helps to calm him (like we were told they should). We’ve experimented with more play, less play, more training time, less training time, different schedules, etc. We’ll try something that works once and feel like we’ve had a breakthrough and then it’ll never work again. Nothing seems to consistently help him calm.

If it’s not evident, my entire life has been consumed by puppy and so I’ve probably read every blog post, article, reddit post, you name it, about the problems we’re having and honestly, everything I read is starting to feel very patronizing. Everything is about practicing to be calm (which we’ve been doing) but nothing is helpful for when he’s at a 10 which is every day. Even when I spoke to the trainer to ask about what to do at night (a typical night for us looks like him waking up from a nap around 4 and then slowly amping up while we try everything to keep him cool until around 7 - 8pm when he’s at a 10, nothing helps to calm him and he just constantly jumps, mounts, and bites us for hours until he eventually passes out) she suggested letting him sleep outside the room which would be great except if he has access to us, he’s fixated on us, if he doesn’t he’d be barking at the bedroom door until he did. She also suggested a pen in the room but again, if he doesn’t have access to us (especially when he’s at a 10) he’ll whine and bark and honestly probably jump over it to get out. No hate to my trainer because she’s been super helpful in order areas but this, along with everything I read online, is making me feel a bit gaslit about how difficult it is to deal with my puppy at night. It seems impossible for me to find someone else out there dealing with the same situation as us.

We’re still in the process of crate training so while he has a positive association with it, he’s still not at the point where we can use it for enforced naps or bedtime. We’ve tried tethering him but he gets frustrated and chews at the leash (he’s chewed through a few at this point).

I feel like I’m drowning and I can’t seem to catch a break. I don’t say this lightly but I feel like having him has been traumatizing. I have ADHD and I have sensory issues which has made it very difficult to function as he is a constant distraction and when he bites me or barks, I shut down immediately (I guess we bond over mutual meltdowns). My nervous system is fried, I’m struggling to get my work done, my self care has completely gone out the window, I very quickly slip into not-so-healthy thinking lately, especially when it’s been a long day and he’s at a 10 and it’s bed time. I’m often confined to the kitchen table all day because getting up while he naps wakes him up and he’s immediately stressed. I feel like I’m walking on egg shells and like I’ve completely contorted my life to work around him which I’ve always been told not to and of course I don’t want to be doing in the long run but at this point it’s a matter of doing things for myself and having to deal with him at a 10 all day or bending to his sensitivity and (hopefully) having a decent-ish day and the thought of having to live like this for another 4 months - 2 years sends me over the edge. It’s unsustainable and I need to find another way.

My family always had dogs, most of them working breeds and I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I also have friends with puppies, who don’t put nearly as much effort or energy into their dogs and their dogs are chill. I know my pup’s his own dog but it’s super hard not to compare and to not feel like I’m doing something wrong. 

It makes me super sad because he’s very clearly in distress often and the only times he’s really engaged with me if when he’s trying to mount me or bite me and it’s making me resent him which breaks my heart to even say because I love him so much but I’m also struggling so much.

I’ve been wondering if maybe I should talk to a vet to rule out any health issues or anxiety issues as a result of his rough start in life. Force-free training is also the only training method I’m open to following so I won’t be trying any aversive tools with him.

I think this was mostly a vent so if you’ve read all of this so far, thanks! I am open to any kind advice if you have it, or even just some validation - I could use it.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/t3zxsq/my_mental_health_is_destroyed_is_my_puppy_ok/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,You should definitely consult a veterinary behaviorist as it sounds like a level of generalized anxiety well beyond normal.

I also understand he needs stimulation and some variety, but a consistent schedule is important, especially for an anxious dog. A vet consult is also a great idea. I never had an anxious dog until my current pup. She wouldn't eat for weeks unless I fed her at midnight, then would potty inside because we were all asleep, and she's very quiet when asking for anything.

,"You've done everything right. And you worked so hard. I can't imagine the titanic amount of work and dedication you put into this pup. And it must be so frustrating not seeing the puppy thrive. 

The inability to ""come down"" so to speak doesn't sound like a regular behavioural issue at all. Even crazy nerve bag tweakers like the malinois (have two) tire themselves out and chill eventually. And while changes in environment or routine can cause an upset, especially to sensitive dogs, this shouldn't last that long. Speaking from experience - one of my dogs is on the anxious side, and I moved with him multiple times, took him to vacation, he'd still usually settle within a day or so. It sounds to me that what you're dealing with might be medical rather than behavioral. 

Have you tested as to whether this isn't a neurological issue? A lot of those manifest or rocket up during adolescence, when the brain is swimming in all kinds of fun chemical cocktails.

,"On top of what everyone else has said here, a few things:


1. Huskys require a ridiculous amount of exercise, so although you take him on a hike in the morning, he needs more. He needs some running exercise. (I work in vet med and we normally say DONT run dogs until they are over a year old,  but if you have access to dirt trails it's a bit better) so either get ready to go running, or if you arent in shape to do so ( I know I'm not) than it's time to teach him to run while you bike, or throw him on a treadmill. He is not the type of dog who can only have a short hike in the morning and be ""ok"" with that. This sounds like a case of when you notice him increasing in energy level to get him out and running BEFORE he is harassing you for hours on end.

"Is it bad that my 11 month pup always wants to walk on my right side? I guess I've conditioned that the right side is the reinforcement zone more than anything. Is this an issue for health/muscle?
So my pup (and to be honest myself) wayyyyyyy prefer the right side to anything else when walking, heeling, just general movement around the house.

I've trained my pup A LOT on right side rewards. Like every time since he was little I always rewarded on the right side when training loose leash, leash pressure, heel, etc. He CAN heel on left, but for loose leash walking and general walking he always sticks on my right side. Even when we walk around the house and just in general moving around he will always prefer to be on my right.

I'm training hard loose leash walking lately because he pulls a bit, but hes getting WAY better. Like hes almost perfectly LLWing now but hes always on my right side. When ever leash pressure happens he returns to my right side. He never really goes in front or on the left. I reward him all the time on my right.

For me personally, I way rather reward on the right side, for some reason its so hard for me to deliver the treats with my left hand. I'm very dominate right hand and I seem to always drop the treats or cant deliver them quickly on my left.

Is this a problem at all? Can this cause issues with health/muscle building if hes always focusing on his left side and looking up at me from one direction? Ive heard several times to practice and reward stuff on both sides, but its just uncomfortable and difficult for me to reward on left. I've tried it, and I've taught heel on the left, but its annoying and I always tend to rather him on the right.

"Resource guarding and mental health
Hej all, 

&#x200B;

this is my first reddit post. I have a puppy that is now almost a year old and just went into her first heat. When she was 4 months old, she was resource guarding, but we did counterconditioning and it never showed up again... until now. I put her in her crate with a bone because I wanted to vacuum the apartment, and when i went to let her out again, she was at 100% resource guarding behaviour. As if we had never done training against it. Like at the 4 months stage. 

&#x200B;

Now, I had a really really shit weekend anyway. I lost something of great emotinal and financial value and have been, honestly, crying on and off. And now this is literally giving me the stab in the heart. 

&#x200B;

Is it normal for dogs to go into resource guarding again when in heat? Can it be trained away again when they are out of heat? How did you cope with it mentally? For me it is kinda really hard right now, though I have learnt not to take it personal. But it definitely shatters the bond that we have formed over the past 8 months again. I just feel... really not good",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/14ip4mk/resource_guarding_and_mental_health/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"8 year old Cockapoo suddenly peeing indoors; not a health issue (or so says vet). Help!
Hi all,

My 8 year old Cockapoo began having accidents in the middle of the night two weeks ago. It's usually only once between 2am-4pm (we catch it on our nanny cam). But, yesterday, she had an accident while we were running errands. We took her to the vet last week and had them run a battery of tests (urine culture, blood work) and everything came back normal. Vet thinks it is behavioral. We think it might be age?

Her recent behavior is particularly alarming as she has had only a handful of pee accidents since we got her as puppy. Like, literally could count it on one hand. 

This is what we have tried so far with no luck: taking her for longer walks 3x a day (will begin adding a fourth walk today), taking her out an hour later than usual at night for a longer walk (she pees at least 4x before we head inside; usually before the accidents she'd pee once or twice), restricting her water intake after her last walk, bought a Fresh Patch and trying to train her to use it on the balcony (no luck so far, same goes with puppy pads...she just pees off to the side of them and tosses them around). 

We have yet to try crating her at night as she detests being enclosed in something (she hasn't been crated since the first year we had her and used to be a terror inside her crate). We just started trying feeding her on the spots where she has her accidents and not sure if time will tell and this will deter her from peeing there.

Open to any and all suggestions. Thank you!",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/yj7ks2/8_year_old_cockapoo_suddenly_peeing_indoors_not_a/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Do you mean that she pees 4 times on her evening walk? If so, that's a lot and I would get a second opinion from another vet. Is she incontinent when she stands up? Is she dribbling a relatively small amount of urine each time, or emptying a full bladder? Is she spayed? That can lead to incontinence, which is usually prevented with medication.

I used to have a female who had been successfully treated for spay incontinence for a few years. About 5 months before she died, she became incontinent. On two occasions the vet detected bacteria in her urine, but the lab was unable to grow anything. Antibiotics seemed to stop the incontinence for a few weeks but it would return, and on one occasion she had an obvious bladder infection, including passing blood and frequent painful urination at this time. During the investigation of her incontinence, an aggressive pancreatic cancer was discovered, which appeared to be an unrelated issue. Her incontinence was suspected to be due to an infection, which most of the time was low grade, caused by a bacteria that was probably resistant to the antibiotic being used. We ran out of time to resolve the problem before she died. I mention this because my dog had a normal temperature and negative urine cultures, but did present with other evidence of infection.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/yj7ks2/8_year_old_cockapoo_suddenly_peeing_indoors_not_a/#iumcnuh,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read up on spay incontinence and see if that looks right?

There are medications that reduce the production of urine.   You may be able up give them to her over night.

Extra or long walks can actually increase her thirst and make a defeating cycle.  More opportunities to urinate, but perhaps not more exercise. 

Nature's miracle or other enzyme cleaner.

See if you can pay for 1x session with a private trainer.   Just to cover your bases.  In any case, it's usually worth the money.

"Neutering dogs: confirmation bias?
Hello all. I want to have a civil discussion about spay and neutering. 

In my country it is illegal to spay, neuter, dock or crop your dog without a medical reason. 
Reasoning is that it is an unnecessary surgery which puts the animals health at risk for the owners aesthetics or ease. 

I very often see especially Americans online harass people for not neutering their dogs. Just my observation. Just recently I saw a video an influencer posted of their (purebred) golden retriever having her first heat and the comment section was basically only many different Americans saying the influencer is irresponsible for not spaying her dog. 

How is it irresponsible leaving your dogs intact? 
Yes it is irresponsible getting a dog if you think it’s too hard to train them when they’re intact, and it’s irresponsible allowing your female dog to be bred (unless you’re a breeder etc). 
I’m not saying don’t spay and neuter in America because especially in countries with a lot of rescues and with stray dogs it is important. But I don’t understand the argument that leaving them intact is cruel. 

Some people cite cancer in reproductive system and that the dog is unhealthily anxious etc as reasoning. Is this confirmation bias or is there truth to it? Am I the one who’s biased here? I think this is a very good law made by my country, since we don’t have stray dogs or rescues in my country (Norway) and no issues with having hunting dogs, police dogs etc who are intact. However, guide dogs and the similar are spayed and neutered. 

I am very open to good sources and being shown that spaying and neutering is beneficial to the dog and not just the owner!",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/uo0xtn/neutering_dogs_confirmation_bias/,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s harsh but they have to make more room for the river of new animals coming in. 

We have such an aggressive spay/neuter stance here because chances are… unless those cute puppies and kittens are purebreds there’s a high chance they’ll end up in a shelter and get put down.

I know in NZ a lot of unplanned litters are because an entire dog has gotten out and has wandered the neighbourhood, and gotten into the backyard of a female in heat. 

Secondly, I’m guessing you’re in a European country, where dog ownership is treated somewhat differently to other countries. Many European countries are a lot more dog friendly, you can take your dog most places with you, on public transport, to shops, cafes/restaurants etc. Which means these dogs are, on the whole, a lot better socialised, well mannered, and controlled because they are used to being in public, in potentially busy situations, around other dogs and people.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/uo0xtn/neutering_dogs_confirmation_bias/#i8c16y4,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The people on this sub were wrong. (Bad story with a positive ending)
I came here about 2 years ago for help with my dog and I was basically told that I would need to rehome him and that I was not fit to own a high energy breed. I was traumatized and deleted the post.

The people on this sub were wrong. 

I'd like to explain my situation as a cautionary tale for those who jump to conclusions on this sub and give out that kind of ""advice"".

Rory is a mini aussie. Like all mini aussies he's a bit..... weird. They're quirky dogs in general and way too smart for their own good, but I love the little jerk. About 6 years ago we moved into a trailer. We had lived in an apartment previously and had had one complaint about our dogs barking in the 9 months we lived there.

The trailer changed Rory. But I had the opportunity to live rent free on family property and for my husband and I to go to school full time. Not something I could pass up. There was also absolutely no way we could move to help the dog be in a chiller situation in Southern California because it is insanely expensive. He was never happy about being left in there alone with just our other dog and it got worse with time. He went from barking to chewing on the RV door handle to scraping and jumping at the door nearly the whole time we were gone. He even managed to deadbolt the door once, locking us out and learned to open the deadbolt expertly if we didn't lock the door mechanically from the outside.

He was getting his excess energy out out as much as a dog could. Played fetch to exhaustion several times a day. At least twice with us a day and one extra time with a dog sitter when we were at school. We did end up crating him sporadically but it seemed to stress him out even more and was making him hate his crate. We did also get some anti anxiety meds from the vet but were not advised correctly on how to use them and they didn't help as a result. So we just tried to have people check in more and not leave him alone whenever possible. We lived like that for a few years. 

Eventually, I finished as much as I could at community colleges and we moved into an apartment larger city. In the trailer, the barking wasn't an issue. In the apartment, it was. We tried leaving him alone like we had done in our previous apartment and he instantly would bark and jump at the door. We moved in the winter so we re-crate trained him and brought him with us when we left because it was lockdown in 2020 and we didn't get out much anyway.

Eventually he was doing great with the crate, would sleep all night, get in quickly, eat in there, etc. But the first time we left him alone in his crate he literally bent the bars trying to get out and pooped in his crate and kicked it all around. He was in pure panic mode. I'm also positive that he was barking and screaming the entire time we were gone. It was traumatic for everyone involved, especially Rory. 

That summer was hell and I came here asking for advice. I said the above and asked if there was literally anything at all thst I could do to help him. As I said before, I deleted the post because the ONLY responses I received passive agressively shamed me and told me to rehome my dog.

After a big cry I decided to buckle down as a big f-you to all of those people. I asked our new vet for meds, they didn't help much. They tried to refer me to a behavioral specialist who charged several hundred dollars an hour. Not an option for us. So I went to another vet, finally found something that seemed to help, trazadone. It's not typically used for this and is usually given to dogs prior to surgery to help them chill, but he was completely zonked out 100% of the time on other meds that had to be taken daily and he wasn't himself. We only needed something for the days he would have to be alone. 

We have spent the last 2 years consistently training him to be home alone. We had to figure out the timing of his meds (2-3 hours before on an empty stomach) and disrupted our usual ""getting ready and leaving the house"" routine to not freak him out. Left him in his crate randomly while we were at home so he could learn relax. He still cried when we left. But slowly he started to improve.

He went from absolute panic to barking and trying to open his newer and stronger crate every few minutes with the meds. Then with the training he started relaxing more and then started actually sleeping once he tuckered himself out. This then turned into him crying for a bit when he realized we weren't there and sleeping with a few little fits that didn't last very long.

I should also mention that whenever we weren't home I was watching the dog on a baby monitor from my phone so I could make sure he was ok. 

Recently he has been much better (thank god because it's hot and we can't bring him with us anywhere).

He was fine being left in his crate for a bit after eating even without the drugs so I could run and grab the mail or delivery food or whatever else I needed to do around here. We would drug him when we went out and plan our outings so we would only go out together maybe 1-2 times a week, if at all.

The last few weeks he hasn't really been barking. And if he does I can just say his name though the baby monitor and it snaps him out of it long enough to let him lay down and sleep. But most times that hasn't even been necessary. 

I also started testing out how long he would tolerate being alone in his crate without the drugs by sitting outside of our door. I left him uncrated once or twice out of curiosity. He didn't bark or jump or chew at the handle of the door. But I assumed he could smell / hear me right outside the door so I didn't expect much. 

But we needed to grab something heavy from the car yesterday. So I decided to set up the camera and unceremoniously leave as we would naturally (shoes on, keys jingling, etc) to see if he would freak out. He didn't. We were only gone for about a max of 10 minutes. And I had to say his name once because he pawed lightly at the door handle . Not in panic. He was definitely just trying to open the door and would have if we hadn't locked it behind us. He settled down right after that and was fine until we came back up. That was a HUGE win. 

We drugged him today so we could go try out a gym together and he was perfect. No barking or scraping or chewing. Just sleep.

I decided to try it again a few hours after we got home with the remainder of the drugs in his system and walked my husband to his car for work. I then sat in the lobby and watched and waited. Not a peep. Not a scratch. Not a bark. For an HOUR. The only noise was a little bit of whining from our older, very chill, but very verbal dog. I definitely could have gone longer but my phone was dying. 

I'm now confident that we are working toward a situation where he can be left out like any other dog. He just needed time, structure, and patience. And I'll continue to provide that for him until he can comfortably be home without feeling that kind of stress ever again. 

All of this to say that this sub was wrong. He isn't a lost cause. I can own a dog like him. I didn't have to rehome him. I told this sub that I was willing to try absolutely anything and got no actual advice. 

The point : Just please think a bit before you tell someone that rehoming is the only option. Please think before you show anything less than genuine compassion. People who come here are asking for help and are often desperate for it because they're at the limits of their knowledge and their situation. Please be kind to these people who are trying to help their animals. I'm sure most of you are kind, but if you don't have anything useful to say, up vote for visibility and move on.

If you got this far, thank you for reading. I really just needed to scream this into the void of the internet. I'm honestly really happy with the progress we've made. Have a lovely rest of your day.

Edit to clarify some things. We avoid using the medication whenever possible. It's not our go to. Actually, we have a great doggy daycare nearby that we use frequently. Daycare isn't always an option. If he isn't medicated and he starts having a full on panic attack when I put in my shoes or grab my keys it's already over. Can you imagine your life if you couldn't go to the grocery store, out to eat, visit friends, etc? Without the very infrequent use of medication that would be our life and even with it we feel pretty trapped at home because we have to condense all of our mutual outings to 1 day a week so that we aren't medicating him constantly. 

He's also not drooling and passed out when he's on it. He's just calmer and doesn't panic as much. Even in his crate he wakes up frequently to look around and peacefully goes back to sleep. When we get home he is attentive and interactive. Just less energy and anxiety than when he is unmedicated. 

He gets plenty of physical activity and a lot of mental stimulation. I know herding dogs need a lot of that and I'm happy to provide it, it's actually one of my joys in life to interact with them that way. Both of our dogs are herding dogs. Only one of them has this issue and the other one is 100% fine even with similar energy and stimulation requirements. We do obedience training several times a day, socialization with other dogs, camping, hiking, hide and seek games with toys in our apartment throughout the day, walk them in the neighborhood multiple times a day, etc. 

Outside of the seperation anxiety, Rory has absolutely no behavioral issues. If this were an overall issue of his needs not being met, I'm pretty sure seperation anxiety wouldn't be the only symptom. 

It's been confirmed by 3 vets that this is a panic disorder. Suggesting excercise and mental stimulation are all that's wrong is like telling a human that their panic attacks will get better if they jog and do sudoku. Sometimes you can do everything right and still have issues that are very situation specific. 

Also, I know I screwed up. I got my dogs when I was 20 because I took them away from my abusive ex when I left. He wanted high energy dogs. I didn't really have a choice. He was starting to abuse the dogs and that was the biggest reason I got out of the situation. I won't get high energy dogs again, but it's the hand I was dealt. 

I also know that the trailer situation was ultimately my fault. He never should have been exposed to that in the first place and I should have done something about it sooner. I definitely regret that. But again, our other herding dog has zero issues from it. There's more going on with his mental health than just the situation at a glance. 

Finally, rehoming is not always the magic that people think it is. It doesn't matter who he's with or where he is. It would have just been transferring the issue to another owner. He still has this issue when he's boarding in dog sitter's homes. 

This also isn't some anti-rehoming crusade. I actually also took a cat out of the abusive situation, realized he was struggling, tried to help but exhausted my options, and found another family through mutual friends who wanted a cat just like him. He's now happily adjusted and living his best life. Sometimes it is a good option. 

But the magical farm that takes troubled dogs and spends 24/7 attending to their needs that some of you must be imagining doesn't exist. He would have just been locked up in another house where the noise was less of an issue with neighbors, which doesn't actually help the dog. Rehoming wasn't a good solution for his specific situation.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/xaicmd/the_people_on_this_sub_were_wrong_bad_story_with/,,,,,,,,,,,,

This isn't a flaw in the owner or their training, it's simple brain chemistry. It's the same as saying therapy will get rid of anxiety in people. For some people, ya that's all they need but others need medication and therapy to manage their symptoms. Rehoming a dog won't fix this and honestly could've made it a lot worse for your dog.

"My dog (3.5yr beagle) is ruling my life, ruining my relationships and mental health, and destroying my house with his newfound anxiety and separation issues!
Last year we moved house as a neighbour was harassing us after we fenced our side garden which he liked to look through. He started knocking on our door daily so that he could yell at us, climbing into our garden when we weren’t in (our dog was and saw him doing it) and “investigating” because he was unhappy with us putting up a fence, and also yelling at us and our dog whenever he saw us outside.

All of this made our dog nervous around people other than those he knows as the old man neighbour was relentless and had no boundaries.

My dog, Scout (3.5yr beagle), was never bothered by people and had no issues of anxiety or separation until all of this began happening.

Ever since the neighbour began acting as he did, my dog freaks out whenever I (specifically me, not me wife) leave the room or house.

Despite us having moved, Scout goes crazy when he can see anyone outside of the house, or if anyone comes into the house. He barks like crazy but doesn’t snap or anything. He weirdly barks like crazy when they are leaving as well. He’s fine when they are in and sat down, he just can’t stand people coming or going.

He is very territorial in his garden and freaks out if he sees the neighbour. He never did this until our old neighbours began harassing us, now he’s petrified and barks like crazy when he can see someone from our back garden.

He also has started pulling excessively on his lead (or leash) to the point of injuring my foot and barks at people in the street, but only when they walk away from him, not when they come to say hello.

He pees in the kitchen as well, and he counter-surfs to look out of the windows, at which point he drools excessively as there are pools of spit by our windows when we get home.

He is never left more than four hours. I work from home as well, so the days he is left are few and far between. He’s also let out to the toilet constantly whilst we are in, but still pees (and poops on occasion) when we leave him. It’s destroying the laminate floor.

He also completely destroyed a door and doorframe when we first moved into the new house and was left alone for a couple of hours.

I know this is a really long post but I don’t know where else to turn! Please help! I have no idea how to deal with all of these issues and I’m at my wit’s end! It’s causing me massive anxiety and depression day-to-day, and it’s costing me lots of money to repair his damage, and straining mine and my wife’s relationship.

I love him so much and just want him to be able to relax and realise that he doesn’t have anything to worry about anymore!",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/rvbmzh/my_dog_35yr_beagle_is_ruling_my_life_ruining_my/,,,,,,,,,,,,

It could also help to slowly introduce a baby gate and reward for being on the other side, slowly building up duration for “alone” time.

For the garden, I’d keep him on leash in case he starts barking so you can bring him in easily. Playing games like engage-disengage (use high value rewards) will be helpful for him to realize that the yard isn’t a scary place. r/reactivedogs can give more suggestions.

 Hi! I hope my post is okay.

Although dogs seem to be very beneficial for our mental health, there is still a lot of disagreement in the literature. Ms Barcelos, Prof Mills, Dr Kargas, Prof Maltby and Dr Hall, from different universities in the UK, are conducting a study related to that.

Dog owners from all nationalities are being invited to answer questions about the activities they do with their dogs and how they affect their mental health. It is available in 4 languages. If you can, please join this investigation!

We usually avoid proper 'people food' because we don't want him to expect it, beg for it, and ultimately it's bad for him. That said, I do give him small quantities of fruit and veg, either raw or cooked, but never anything that's been seasoned or had anything added to it. We do mange tout, peas, bell pepper, the odd teaspoon of mashed potato (pre- any milk or butter additions) or the occasional scrambled egg (no milk added) in his biscuits, the odd slice of banana, apples, pears, strawberries, raspberries, etc. 

He also gets a bit of plain roasted chicken once per month that I hide his flea and worming tablet in 😅",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/r2w0ti/balancing_treats_with_health/#hmbshrt,,,,,,,,,,,,

My dog inherited the protective traits and was not overly aggressive. Each individual dog has its own personality. You know your own time limits and ability best.

Putting her through the “temperament test” would assist you in evaluating her appropriateness for either therapy or service.

"My dog whines constantly but the vet says she’s in good health
My dog has started whining constantly, but the vet says there’s nothing wrong with her. She doesn’t act sick or injured in any way. She continues to whine after I take her out for walks and she poops and pees, and also after she’s eaten, so I don’t think it’s either of those things. 

I’m starting to believe it’s an attention thing. It’s hard not to react when she starts whining, because obviously it’s a concerning sound, but I’m afraid I’ve inadvertently trained her that it’s how she gets my attention.

"Major Behavior/Health Issues Post-Neutering (1.5 yo)
My mom recently adopted a rescue dog (1.5 years old). He was neglected by his previous owners who then brought him to the shelter because they couldn't handle him. The shelter had him for only three days before we adopted him. 

We had him for about 6 weeks and he was adjusting well and beginning to be potty trained. We waited a bit to get him neutered since he needed a more extensive procedure as one testical wasn't external and they would have to find it internally and remove it. After neutering, he has completely reversed. He goes constantly in the house despite my mom taking him out frequently and rewarding him with treats for doing so. He's pretty good during the day but still has occasional accidents. However, once they go upstairs at night he doesn't let my mom sleep. He whines and she has to take him out constantly, sometimes not making it outside before pooping or peeing in the house. This has been going on for weeks and my mom is exhausted and at her wits end. We've spoken with the vet and she prescribed anxiety medication and a sleeping pill (trazodone and gabapentin) to help get him through the night. Last night was the first night with the medication and it was maybe the worst he's had. He threw up multiple times in the bedroom, including in his crate and peed and pooped everywhere. My poor mom is exhausted and not sure what to do to help this situation. She has chronic pain issues and the constant cleaning and lack of sleep is really wearing her down. We're all very fond of this dog and in every other way he's been wonderful - super warm, cuddly and affectionate, obedient and not a big barker, cute as anything, etc.

I would ask for them to ultrasound to confirm the presence of his prostate. Sometimes, when a testicle is not descended, there is a risk of removal/damage of the prostate along side it.

"How to train my newly adopted, overweight and food obsessed dog with treats while supporting his health
A week and a half ago I adopted a 3 year old 25lb schnauzer mix. He is overweight and is very food obsessed. 
Although his love for food helps with training, I am worried about contributing to his unhealthy size.
Are there specific types of treats that are better for weight loss/ health? Is there a particular amount I should be limiting to in a day?
I’m giving him an appropriate amount of food split up in two meals given in a slow feeder bowl. He is also getting daily hikes and walks.

Personally, I'd just ditch the bowls and use his kibble for most of the training. That's what I do for my dog. I measure his daily food into a Tupperware container and use it to reinforce and train throughout the day. Anything leftover at the end of the day, he gets in a kong or puzzle toy.

,"Amazon is a cesspool of counterfeit products at this point. I don't buy dog products there because there's no way to trust they are animal safe. Chewy reviews have been very reliable, and their return policy is exceptional. I have never seen any company stand by its sales as thoroughly as they do. If you are unsatisfied for any reason whatsoever within a year, they refund. Often they don't even bother to have you send the product back and ask that you instead donate it to a local animal shelter. Their house brand Frisco usually is pretty good quality and usually at a reasonable price. Occasionally there have been disappointments but again in those few instances we just notified them and they refunded without hesitation so we could choose something else. They constantly have sales, so my best advice is to use customer reviews to pick out what you want then wait for those items to go on sale because they almost certainly will.

As for specific products, our superchewer has destroyed every rubber toy including most Kongs. But for some reason her plastic Kong Wobbler is allowed to remain largely unscathed. She dines from it every day, thwacking it all around the house, scolding it, and she even has mastered how to unscrew it somehow. But when she chews on it, she is remarkably gentle. She seems to understand this one is for loving, not gnawing. But if it ever does get irreparably damaged, well get her another one for sure. It provides lots of mental and physical stimulation every day and she never gets bored of it. Our other dog doesn't care about it whatsoever, so no guarantees whether your dog would enjoy it. But that's our one forever toy. Another is the snuffle mat, which our other dog is obsessed with. Apparently food tastes better when it has to be sniffed out and pawed up rather than just wolfed up from a bowl. Indispensable. Before we got it, she was very finicky about food and would get bored with any given kibble after a week or two. The constant changes was hell on her digestion, but she'd refuse to eat once she she tired of a flavor. Now she's eaten the exact same kibble for 4 months and still dives in gleefully. Thanks to the snuffle mat. We're also huge fans of Canada Pooch's line of cooling products.  Expensive, but good build quality and solve an important problem.

ChuckIt and Westpaw toys have been the most durable in our house. All other toys exist to be destroyed. Westpaw is really expensive, but they also have an ethical orientation to materials and production that I consider worth supporting, and the superior durability makes the expense fair. But ChuckIt quality seems nearly as good and is much more modest price if you're on a budget.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/10zzsyw/dear_experienced_dog_owners_what_are_your_buy_it/#j86bb9g,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I know some people won’t agree, but I love a leather leash. It’s more flexible and communicates my intentions better, plus it’s just a wipe down and oil occasionally (which is important to me because sometimes my leash touches the ground in the poo area of my apartment, and it’s a gross place to be…so it definitely gets a nice ‘wash’ every week with an antibiotic wet wipe and then a dry cloth lol). The con is that if you have a dog that pulls a lot leather leashes can just snap at a weak spot.

I also have a Dremel - the real kind, not the ‘just for paws’ kind, and I have the  flexible head thingy to keep the motor away from my dog and make it easier. It’s SO MUCH better than the ‘just for paws’ kind. I have had it for two dogs, and I can do all four paws in under five minutes on a cooperative dog.

"Sudden dog aggression, health or behavioral?
My 14 mo dog has recently had sudden and consistent aggression primarily towards my other 13 yo dog. She is growling at us too however whenever she is laying down, her haunches raise and she growls at us when we try and pet or soothe her. That can be avoided but she has been trying to attack  my much older other dog when my other dog enters our bedroom.  They’re used to eachother and this is seemingly random and new. She gets agility training and isn’t reprimanded or punished during any kinds of training, in other words we haven’t trained her in a high stress environment or to be reactive, we don’t shout or hit etc. She isn’t spayed yet but has already had her first heat. This aggression has come on somewhat suddenly, we’ve had some issues before but they were few and far between and usually because she was exhausted and didn’t want to get off the bed. She had aggression when she was in heat too but afterwords she really became very sweet and well rounded. She still plays and seems healthy, her agility training seemed to go well today. And she went to the lake afterward and acted normally, played in the yard, slept, etc. 

Should i go to the vet? what sort of of tests would a vet do to determine whether or not this is a health or behavioral issue? What do I do when a dog growls or attacks my other dog? I know you’re not suppose to back away from a growling dog, not suppose to punish them for this warning signal, but what DO you do? When she attacked my dog today I pulled her off and told her no and bad dog.

On July 29th, this girl jumped into my car while working. We took all necessary steps, eventually finding out that she was adopted from the local shelter during a free adoption weekend and then dumped/let loose about a month later. She roamed for another month according to neighborhood locals until I got her. 

The shelter provided me with her old paperwork, citing that they thought she was 3 mos in April 2022, which would put her about 9-10 months right now. She didn’t deserve anything that happened to her and we will not give up on her no matter what. She has an amazing bond with our 2yo son and I think she is his “heart dog”. However, she’s still a puppy and we have never had a puppy before. We have 2 full grown Shih Tzus in addition to new girl, Penny.

She is a spayed female, about 30 pounds now. She was very skinny when we got her, so I’m not sure what to expect on size. Her feet don’t seem out of proportion to her body at this point, but could malnutrition have effected that? 

She seems to have some sort of allergy as well. After her flea/tick bites and injuries from the elements healed she has continued to itch and has small, round bare patches on her sides mainly. Anyone know if this is common/what it is? We use Wag brand dog food from Amazon and I give her an additional supplement for hair and bone health. I have been mixing some tuna in her food to make it more appealing to her. She also gets some CBD oil to help with hyperness occasionally. I’ve washed her with St. Ives oatmeal wash (we use on our hedgehogs because it’s so gentle), Dawn dish soap, regular puppy soap, and flea/ticks dog soap. I rinse thoroughly but it doesn’t seem to cut down on itching. 

I am also looking for advice on training, socializing, etc because I am conflicted on where to begin. I want her to grow up around other dogs to learn kindness and how to read body language, but she is a bad eloper due to her stray past. I don’t want to anger or offend other dog owners by taking her to the dog park for socialization when her recall is not what it should be yet, but I’m afraid to wait too long and then have her not socialized correctly. Any and all tips welcomed and so appreciated!

I know our situation isn’t ideal for her right now, she has so much energy and I want to take her out of the yard for playtime and walks but the more we venture into the neighborhood, the more she tries to run off. I don’t want to discourage her energy and playful behavior, but it is turning destructive and driving my husband crazy. I guess I am looking for input from the dog community to see how well we might be accepted at a dog park at this point. I want her to have the life she deserves with the people she has chosen to love her, please help me give her that! 

TL;DR - we were chosen by a lab/boxer mix and I need all the advice on training and socialization and any boxador experiences!

,"Please don’t bring her to a dog park if you haven’t developed a strong bond yet (and also not later but that’s another discussion). Socializing isn’t „get her together with other dogs“, socializing means teaching her how to be calm in various life situations. Eg when seeing dogs in the distance / noises / people etc. Start rewarding her for being calm and do that sooner than later since she’s still young. Please do not let her walk off leash for now, at least for the first 3 months as that’s how long it’ll take (minimum) for her to feel at home with you. Did she see a vet at all yet? Got her vaccinations up to date? If you meet him next time definitely talk about the itching issue, yes it could be allergies but also tons of other things so better to be save here. Also please make sure to supervise ALL play time your dog has with your child.

,"I can only possibly offer advice on the itchy spots. My rescue came with a ton of bald patches, and continued to have itchiness for quite some time.  We eventually learned he was extremely allergic to both fleas and grass.  Even after he was on a flea/tick preventative, it took a really long time for the bald areas to stop itching and fill back in with fur. 

There are dog allergists, but it’s an expensive test. Learning it was a grass allergy wasn’t particularly helpful, since we couldn’t avoid it. I already had my dog on flea prevention. 

In addition to monthly flea/tick/heart worm prevention, we did weekly baths with a moisturizing dog shampoo, followed by a leave in conditioner that had anti itch ingredients. (Warren London was the brand, I think it’s sold at Petco).  My vet said to never use soap, especially dish soap, because it will strip away the protective oils the dogs skin is releasing to heal the allergic reaction. 

After about 5 months, we noticed the itching stopped, and his coat filled in about a year later. 

I can’t say if any of this applies to your dog, but your vet can likely determine if it is an allergy issue. The vet may want to eliminate ringworm as a cause, and I think that test is relatively cheap.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/xx9i5g/boxador_puppy_help/#irbt35x,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Should I teach my frenchie to climb stairs if it'll lead to health problems
My family and I have been trying to train my five month frenchie to climb up on a box because of Canine Intervention on Netflix. I think this is a good gateway for learning skills. I tried luring him with his favorite treats on top of the box but if he can't reach it by stretching his neck and using his front legs, he'll back away. When anyone goes up the stairs in our house he will use his front legs to peer at us but won't go up. He jumps up on the couches all the time, but cowers and submissively lies down when we get near stairs. I want him to be comfortable with stairs but the problem is we've been told frenchies get bad joint problems if they use the stairs too much so we haven't taught him how.  I figure most people will say the ""Put him on a couple stairs up and increase the distance technique."" But is there a way to teach him how to climb stairs without him doing it all the time? When he gets the zoomies, he climbs up and down the couches and that's already bad enough because they're pretty high off the ground. 
Also are there any separate tips for teaching him to climb a box? Because I don't know if stair-training will help but I'm just assuming here (first time dog owner).

TL;DR: we want to teach our frenchie to stop being afraid of stairs because it's a problem with skill training.

Just to start please do not follow the trainign techniques shown. They range from mostly pointless (like doing puppy training on a box) to actually very harmful.

Not going up and down stairs a lot is a good idea for pretty much all puppies because of joint concerns, however you don't want your dog to be scared of the stairs. I would teach them to go up so that it does not become a fear issue. You can use a reward for exploring technique to do that. Just let your puppy start where they are comfortable and then mark and reward when they approach the stairs. Then when they interact with them, then when they step on them.....

"I give up walking my dog outside
For the past 3 years I’ve had a reactive dog, as an attempt to be a good owner I’ve walked him outside religiously 3 times a day during that time despite being extremely reactive to other dogs, people on scooters, smaller animals etc. I still decided to take him outside and overall its put an insane amount of stress on me, it is a nightmare, despite all my attempts to have a healthy and happy dog that isn’t inside 24/7. I don’t have a car so I’m unable to take him places far away where we’re not going to find other dogs, he pulls a lot on the leash, it is extremely frustrating and it is taking a toll on my mental health, It breaks my heart to have him be at home all the time but I need to take a break from this",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/10tlryl/i_give_up_walking_my_dog_outside/,,,,,,,,,,,,

My only recommendation would be to set a timer for the amount of time you used to go on walks and hold yourself to activity playing with your dog for that amount of time. 

Some good indoor activities I do with my (big!) apartment living dog
- canine conditioning (basically dog strength training - good exercise) 
- toy play (in my living room I toss around a toy and play tug and mini fetch with her)
- hide the toy/hide the treat (dog in a stay, I walk away and put down a toy ir treat out of sight and then release her, she runs to find it)

,"Sounds like you have a high energy dog. I think you should try making your dog completely tired BEFORE going outside. Exert all the energy at home, go outside when he’s too tired to react, you reward when passing triggers. (I don’t agree with rewarding everytime with a great, a simple good boy/girl and a few pets can get the job done tbh.) 

I’ve use this tactic successfully to regain control of a Italian mastiff with an owner 55 yrs old at the time. Mastiff was super reactive to anything near handler.

My approach : play, play, play at home for about 30 mins straight. Can literally be anything that gets your dog moving around non stop. For us it was a small game of fetch. Normally I just kept going till I see him panting nonstop. Then leash and right out. Slower wake of course but the attitude in the walk completely changes. All the energy is exerted. And all he’s worried about is pee, poop, nap. It worked for me on a really big dog, so just passing on the info.  

Also take into account some dogs have natural resource guarding! You should try to let someone else walk your dog and see how they react! It’s very different!",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/10tlryl/i_give_up_walking_my_dog_outside/#j77ixmv,,,,,,,,,,,,

Walks are continually stimulating, and incredibly frustrating for many dogs, which makes it stressful for you and the dog. That's not beneficial. You can exhaust a dog physically in your living room with balance and conditioning equipment. You can play with a flirt pole, fetch, tug, etc. in the yard. Walks are not the gold standard for dog ownership.You don't need to walk your dog, and certainly not 3x/day. I do think it is important to meet physical and enrichment needs, and to have a dog reasonably comfortable in public so things like vet visits and car rides and such aren't traumatic.

"Bad at fetch - training issue or health problem?
Long time Reddit lurker, first time poster. I adopted a ~2 year old standard poodle last June. He’s an extremely sensitive boy, and since adopting him, more health problems have revealed themselves over time. We figured out he has pretty severe anxiety and is highly reactive to other dogs, although both are improving since starting daily SSRIs. 

We went to the park yesterday to get some zoomies out and I noticed two things that sort of concerned me while we were playing fetch:

1. When I throw the ball, he sometimes runs in a completely different direction. I’m not talking about falling for a fakeout—I mean I will throw the ball straight north and he will run due west at full speed, then just stop and look around like, “dangit, I can’t remember what I came into the kitchen for...” 
It happens about 15-20% of the time, which seems too often to be a fluke. 

2. He absolutely will not pick up the ball once it stops moving. If he doesn’t make it to the ball’s landing spot by the time it stops bouncing/rolling, it immediately no longer exists to him. Even with a lot of encouragement/walking over and pointing to the ball, he won’t grab it. The only way to get him to pick it up is to kick it a few feet, and then he’ll pounce on it. 

He’s generally quite good at fetch, and seems to have quickly picked up on the throw-chase-pickup-return-drop it-sit-repeat. He’s pretty consistent except for the two situations above. 

I’m having trouble trying to determine if this is just something that needs more practice, or if I should be concerned about his vision. Is he not able to follow the ball once it’s airborne? Is the moving ball easier to spot? How do you even test a dog’s vision? Am I overthinking it? (Probably). I know he has *some* vision, as he will respond to hand signals for sit, down, stay, etc. but these are always done at close range.

,"Professional dog trainer here! And I work with puppies under 5 months old as my main job. You have two options.  
1. Have zoomies! I choose this option *if* zoomies do not include chomping on me or other dangerous, destructive, or painful behaviors and *if* we have a good place to zoom. I generally let puppy outside and clap my hands chanting ""Go puppy go! Go, go go!"" As puppy comes toward me I turn and run the same direction so they catch up and run past me, then I turn around and run the other way as they catch up again and zoom past. All while chanting and clapping. If drive by puppy chomps are a risk then toss a toy as puppy is almost caught up to direct zooms toward the toy (don't expect puppy to fetch! throwing is redirection, you're not playing fetch in this context); or  
2. Prevent zoomies before they start. Puppies commonly get zoomies around 8-9pm but start tracking exactly when the zoomies hit (and as a bonus, track how long after dinner because that can be a factor too). If you know zoomies typically start between 8-8:15pm, play and do some training at about 7:30 until 7:45, give puppy a chance to potty, then crate for a nap.  
  
Pro tip: if zoomies happen unexpected and include chomping, or any time puppy is frantically chompy, pick them up under the armpits with the bitey end facing away from you. Support their butt with your stomach. Like in Lion King when baby Simba is held up, but close to your body. They cannot reach you with their teeth and cannot scratch you. You won't be able to do this once they're ~15-20+ lbs but as a safe, effective way to carry them to their crate for a nap it's my favorite way to hold them. They're supported and you won't get chomped or scratched. This is NOT a longterm solution, you still need to teach impulse control, bite inhibition, how to calm down and settle, all those important life skills.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/p5vcqf/never_heard_of_puppy_zoomies_until_my_wife_talked/#h992900,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Zoomies are very natural and shouldn't be discouraged. They get a burst of energy and are working it out. You can reduce zoomie frequency/intensity by exercising/playing with your dog frequently. Giving them a lot mental/physical stimulation is important; furthermore, they should already be getting mental stimulation because you should be working on training them. If you're not working on basic commands like sit, down, stay, heel, come, etc, then you should be. Also, the time duration doesn't need to be long. 15 minute sessions sprinkled throughout the day should be sufficient as a puppy and increased in duration as they get older (probably 30 - 60 minutes max, depending on breed and what you're trying to train them).",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/p5vcqf/never_heard_of_puppy_zoomies_until_my_wife_talked/#h9ahfm7,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"""a year and a half year old intact male Australian Cattle Dog/ Border Collie mix (we think)""

had a very similar dog from 8 weeks.

&#x200B;

good news / bad news

good news this is normal and you're not a bad owner it sounds like you give him a lot of attention

bad news, is also this is normal; this is a dog from breeds that have been bred to keep a decent pace/often run all day every day herding often much larger animals and and 1 1/2 is at peak energy/spaz level. he needs an intense level of attention/exercise at this age  


it gets better! in another 6 months-1 year he will chill out a lot as he hits full adult maturity and will progressively naturally need less exercise as he  ages even if it will still be an above avg amount

the only real option is even more activity and exercise, i highly recommend a large and well-attended dog park

another one I did a lot when my last dog was that age was if you have indoor or outdoor access to a full flight of stairs the taller and steeper the better teach the dog to play fetch up and down the stairs while you just sit at the top

basically anything you can think of to wear the dog out as much as possible

interactive toys are worth trying too, a classic is mix kibble peanut butter and hot water together to make a mush, jam the mush tight into a large kong toy, freeze overnight

i tried a few other interactive ones but tbh these working type dogs also tend to be shadow dogs/want your attention more than anything (hence whining at you)

don't try to punish the behavior, it's mean doesn't work anyway and i don't even mean that in a general way it specifically won't work for this behavior you would be fighting behaviors literally built into their genes",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/tam2jz/does_anyone_have_advice_for_training_for_whining/#i0227m6,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Sounds like u have a ""frustrated greeter."" My previous pup was not like this so i was very embarassed/stressed by it when my current dog was. The process below took about 6 months and now she is good.

I am not a trainer but this routine is from a trainer.  You will need a training clicker or other marking tool. 

Also, all of the following advice has to be 100% on point _in isolation_ before your pup will be able to do them w _distractions._  The idea is to add one piece to the puzzle at a time, so that you set them up for success. 

Unfortunately this kind of work has a chicken/egg element: training wont take hold until they are exercised and focused.  Yet, going for walks is their exercise!  So which can be done first??  Its frustrating. Also, never go for walks without treats!  The treats should be their *favorite* of all treats. 

*Phase 1: the prep work* 

A. ""Look at me"" command. They make contact w you on command.  Treat and clicker.  Find the best treats in the world, even hot dog bits. 

B.  Practice frustrating scenarios for them at your house.  Examples, leave it, stay.  Anything that improves their impulse control. 

C.  ""Heal"" command on walks.  Make a u-turn when they pull.  You will have to make adjustments for walks in intentionally less crowded places. (Note: im sacramento, also where it is shady and when it is cool enough too!) 

D.  Treats and clicker when they voluntarily look up at you to check in while on walks.  When you are out on walks, give LOTS of treats and praise (and clicker) when they voluntarily look up at you.  At this point, do NOT use the ""look at me"" command bc it will lose effectiveness when they are distracted.  Give the command AFTER they look up at you.  They may be so distracted that you stand still on the sidewalk for 5 minutes until they finally look at you. 

E. Reactivity is related to impatience and ""tolerance for frustration,"" so a lot of your training should be to teach your dog how to cope w not getting exactly what they want when they want it. Work on ""stay"", ""wait"" and ""leave it"" at home.  Do not let the dog run out the door.  Open the door and they can go when YOU say so.  Also, your dog should be able to entertain themself while you are busy or working.  Do not let your dog demand play from you (that one is hard!). 

*Phase 2: the threshold* 

A.  While on a walk, distance is your friend.  Most dogs start w a threshold around 20 ft.  This threshold is their comfort zone and if u violate it, no training can take place bc they go into reactionary overdrive.  Start by actively keeping distance from the triggers.  This is harder in city environments, but its key.  

B.  Condition your pup to the triggers.  Any time a trigger is approaching, give them tons of treats and lots of sweet praise.  They need to learn that the trigger is a positive experience. Never scold or say no.  Do NOT pull on the leash or make the experience of seeing their triggers negative!!! We see owners do this continually and they are actually training their dogs to be more uncomfortable around those triggers! 

C.  Keep moving.  There are limited scenarios where sitting and staying while your dog's trigger passes is a good idea.  As youre treating and praising, keep moving.  If possible, dont pull the leash tight or put stress on the leash/harness.  Loop out wide when you see triggers so you can keep the leash loose and keep moving. 

*Phase 3: making progress* 

Eventually, the triggers wont be so scary bc your dog will associate them with positivity. The next adjustment i would make are in this order: 

A.  As your pup learns that triggers are positive, give the ""look at me"" command when still within the safe threshold distance so that  they start to look at you when triggers approach.  Clicker-treats-praise.  

B.  As your pup voluntarily looks at triggers and then to you, you can start the ""good look!"" command.  Every time your pup looks at a trigger and doesnt react, ""good look!"" Treats-praise-clicker.  This conditions the dog to see their trigger and look at you instead! 

C.  Lessen the distance between your pup and the trigger, lessening but never violating their threshold. 

D.  Sit on a park bench after a long walk and practice sit and good looks at passing dogs.  As with walks, start w benches that are farther from walking paths and eventually move on to benches that are closer to walking paths.  This goes back to teaching them to tolerate frustration.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/xydebt/any_advice_for_leash_pulling_and_barking_when/#irise6s,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This is very typical of her age. She’s a doggy teenager, super social and wants make tons of friends. One thing that may help is making sure she has opportunities to play with other dogs off leash. I know many people are anti dog park, but this is the age it may actually benefit from them. I would look for the biggest dog park in your area space wise. When you bring your dog, stay outside the fence (at a distance where your dog isn’t barking), to observe the owners and their dogs. See if they’re paying attention to their dogs and actively stepping in to help any stressed out pup. 

This is also a good way to practice calmness around other dogs, by being treats and rewarding her for calm behavior. If she’s ok, you can get closer, but back off before she has any reactions.

Once you go into the park, see how your dog is feeling. Young dogs are usually a little nervous at first, that’s ok. If she fails to open up after a little bit and gets more nervous— tucked tail, snapping and running away from dogs—then it’s time to leave. I would keep the visits short anyway, at leas initially, 15-20 minutes. Consider leaving if you notice any escalating conflicts between dogs. Many dogs will run toward commotion.  Most contentious owners with an upset pup will either try to find a different area away from the other dog, or just leave altogether. That’s what you want.

,"If she is food stimulated in training you might try using that. What I did with my dog was when I saw a dog approaching us i would try to change his attention from the dog to me.

After he got used to that, i would try to capture his attention verbally first (look at me, here, look what I have here) and when he looked I would offer treats and praising.

,"If she's doing this for potty breaks, the two leash method that others have recommended is easy and effective.

If you don't need to walk her for potty breaks, then I advise not taking her on walks at all yet. Instead, use walk time to teach polite leash skills indoors, without a leash, and without distractions. Teach her what your expectations are for walking and solidify the skills she needs before sticking her in such an exciting environment (outdoors attached to a cool tug toy).

I use the phrases ""let's walk"" to let them know we're about to move, ""slow down"" before they reach the end of the leash to let them know to come back toward me, and ""this way"" to let them know we're changing direction.

For ""let's walk"" I lure them with a treat. Some pups need to start with a single step at a time and work their way up, others will gladly follow the treat for longer. Once they get the idea, you can throw in the phrase and practice some more. Then you can stop luring and just give them a treat every several steps.

For ""slow down,"" I say the phrase and drop a treat at my side. Repeat a bunch until you say the phrase and pup comes looking for the treat before you drop it.

For ""this way,"" I just go back to luring them with me as I turn.

Once she understands some directional cues and can walk politely, add the leash and continue training indoors. She'll have the skills so you'll be able to communicate what you want from her and she'll likely be focused on you and the treats instead of the leash. She'll already be familiar with the game, only this time there's a leash attached to her.

Once she's got those skills nice and solid while leashed, practice for short periods of time outside.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ryeekq/chewing_and_tugging_at_the_leash_help_65_month/#hrp1bnu,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cue X = the game is on. We play tug. 

Play unbroken until the dog is definitely tired. 

Cue Y = game over. Let go of the tug and walk around until the dog drops the toy. Go back to the car or in the house or to a different room and get the toy later. Don’t present the tug toy until you give cue X again to start the game again and repeat. Play at least once a day. 

Cue X turns drive on
Cue Y turns drive off

The game teaches the appropriate context and item to play a possession game. Eventually when the dog chooses a walk as a time to initiate a game of tug and a leash as the object you’ll be able to say cue Y to tell them that that is not the appropriate context to play the game.

,"As someone else said check out r/puppy101 it's such a fantastic resource for raising a puppy! It's full of training tips and people who in the same situation as you! 

And as others have said I suggest you have a crate with you can adjust the size of to grow with your puppy. If they have room to go potty in it and still have a place to sleep away from it they will. And remember you're dealing with a tiny baby puppy so they have little bladders and not a lot of control over them. For the first few weeks I took my puppy out every 3 hours at night and kept the crate in my bedroom. At 14 weeks we moved him to the living room and reduced potty trips to once at like 2 am. 

I'd also suggest you have a playpen you can leave your puppy in so they are confined and safe while they are awake and you can take your eyes off of them for a moment if you need to. 

Another major thing that helped keep me sane was enforced naps and a strict schedule. Our pup was up for an hour and then crated and sleeping for 2 hours. Potty break before and after nap and as needed during the hour he was up. Puppies need a lot more sleep than most people realize, from 18-20 hours and mine was not one to self regulate his sleep. Good luck!! You're gonna have a great buddy soon!!

,"Just coming to the end of our first week with a new Labrador puppy... echoing all the crate training comments but here are a few other points from someone in the middle of it... 
1) You will be TIRED; even if your pup is good at sleeping during the night, I’ve found that watching ours like a hawk for toilet training is pretty exhausting. 
2) You’re probably not going to get much productive done this week, so prepare for that! 
3) Get yourself plenty of toys; you’ll need a variety to swap in and out to stop puppy chewing. 
4) Prepare yourself mentally for puppy blues. We’ve found it to be a bit overwhelming at times.
5) If there are two of you, tagging in and out and allowing each other space from puppy really helps.

Regarding sleeping, I slept downstairs next to her crate for the first four nights, had toilet break at about 1:30. For the last couple of nights I’ve been waiting next to her crate until she settles, then sneaking upstairs. In terms of actual training we’ve made a start on crate training, and have got a fairly reliable (if short lived) “sit”. We’ve tried clicker training but tbh I’m not sure she understands it yet!",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/idy8kr/we_pick_our_first_ever_puppy_up_on_21st_september/#g2cyhio,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You’ve gotten a lot of good advice here already, I haven’t seen it already but remember that the crate should be your puppy’s safe space as well! To make your puppy comfortable there it’s a good idea to feed them their meals in the crate and let them explore it, don’t necessarily force them in. The first few times you feed him in the crate you don’t even have to close it, just slowly get him comfortable in there. Even if he’s still not fully crate trained he still needs to sleep in the crate. Just take it step by step and you’ll figure things out, it’s okay to make mistakes. Just keep doing your best and I’m sure you’ll figure it out!",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/idy8kr/we_pick_our_first_ever_puppy_up_on_21st_september/#g2cp1s2,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"So this is only my take based on this video.  Your dog was showing some signals that he was mildly stressed as soon as you stood up (lip licking, larger eyes than I expect - I noticed a general stiffness as well).  He seems to be fairly concerned about where you are.

I think unfortunately just as you left the room, your roommate accidentally blocked his view/access of you in a way that surprised him which resulted in your dog reacting in not a great way.

Does your dog constantly follow you around?  I'm wondering if there's a bit of separation distress or perhaps some guarding of you.

I cannot say for certain, but that's my best guess.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/n4930r/so_out_of_nowhere_today_my_dog_decided_to_lash/#gwublge,,,,,,,,,,,,

It looks like he trys to jump but with the roommate getting up he missteps and rams into him akwardly. Did he actually bite him? If he didn't bite him maybe it was just a derpy thing he did? Especially if this is super out of character. I mean if he was really going to attack him it's weird that he's just chill after too. I can see how your roommate would think it's an attack as he got hit from behind but the dog does not look aggressive to me  honestly and an aggressive dog typically wouldn't go from trying to lunge at someone one minute to just walking away the next. The roommates arm was right there when he was on the floor he could have easily latched on and he didnt.,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/n4930r/so_out_of_nowhere_today_my_dog_decided_to_lash/#gwujr2j,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Trainer here! I see stress from the pillow movement and you getting farther away--lip licks, stiffness, rapid eye movements without the head going along, and a focus on your roommate's hands that were moving in an unusual way as he stretched. It looked to me like the dog was at least considering biting roommate's arm even if he didn't follow through. He probably aborted when the roommate froze in response--that was the first response to his body language he had gotten, so keep in mind dog was communicating the whole time, but nobody responded to dog until the lunge. 

It's also a great sign that he didn't go for a serious chomp. Not quite enough to say that he has good bite inhibition, but it could be a good sign. A dog who does mild warning bites is a lot safer than a dog who bottles it up until he feels like he is now in a fight to the death if that makes sense. 

People standing up from sitting or crouched is a very common point in which a dog who is feeling stressed might choose to react. Sitting people are not only smaller, but less ready-for-action (and thus to attack) than standing people, so standing up can be threatening to a dog who is scared or worried. People with their back to the dog moving away is another time you see a lot of bites, especially at entryways. 

To prevent in future, a lot of it is about opening the lines of communication. The more everybody is aware when he is uncomfortable by checking on him and responding to his stress signals, the easier you will all have it. For example, you get up, put the pillow down, notice it made him uncomfortable. You yawn at him to signify there's nothing to worry about. You walk farther from the roommate, invite dog to follow you on a more open path around the outside of the room. Roommate looks, either gets up while dog is moving away, or waits until dog has passed, instead of doing it while dog is nervous and moving toward roommate. Many many dogs need help with creating more distance from something that is worrying them. So any time you see signs of stress but the dog doesn't seem to be doing anything about it, help them make good decisions to create distance. The more you practice that the better they get at doing it on their own.

It seems like the couch could be a bit of a danger zone with that history (and hands too), so I would pay extra attention to him when he is near or on the couch. Figure out if hand movements while he's on the couch tend to put him on edge, or if it's you leaving, both, or anything that has a pattern to it. Then you can countercondition his emotional response to these triggers by giving him treats for noticing the trigger. This is classical conditioning, not operant conditioning, so you don't have to worry about rewarding decisions, just changing feelings from fear to happy anticipation.

Scaredy dogs do start coming out of their shell at 3-6 months after adoption. The first months they don't feel safe enough to make sure you know when they are uncomfortable. 

Pairing your roommate with food and/or fun chill positive training will help him not worry about the roommate. Dogs bond also by walking together, so if roommate might walk with you sometimes it could really help that relationship. For guests, if it's going to be more than someone who can act non-rambunctious and pay attention and follow your directions, I would start by crating him somewhere he can watch but still feel safe, or even out of sight if he's too upset by watching. Be very careful about kids. They are loud and unpredictable and move fast and in strange ways, all very threatening to a scaredy dog. 

Confidence building work like scent games and food puzzle toys, and some work on separation anxiety, could help. If you feel like he has a really hard time getting back to relaxed after something freaks him out (low resilience) some behavior meds could help. 

Good trainer can help a lot, but there are so many bad ones and it's unregulated. Be very very picky.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/n4930r/so_out_of_nowhere_today_my_dog_decided_to_lash/#gwv25lc,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"My only suggestion is to start establishing boundaries with that couch and any general area where the dog  could be on the same level as another human; ie bed, chairs, etc. I know it sucks to feel like you’re separating from your dog, but I think of that separation as space for the dog to let go of all their anxiety and baggage while in your company. Then you can make a habit of connecting with the dog through general leadership, affection and positive reinforcement. 

I think someone mentioned it earlier, but the dog got nervous and protective as you left, and as your friend got in between you, the dogs concern increased significantly. If the dog is trained and encouraged to relax in their own doggy bed on the floor, when you have company, your dog will gravitate to their bed / the floor, instead of being in a position where they feel the need to protect you. 

You can also encourage this behavior from your dog by saying “go to your bed”, and offer high value treats, maybe even appropriate table food, but only when they’re in their bed!!!

Edit: also shout out to your friend for handling that calmly!

,"Copying an old comment because my dog was exactly the same way and with some time and patience I've mostly trained it out of him. (He regresses a little if he doesn't regularly practice).

My dog had similar issues when I first adopted him at three years old. I played this game on every walk the first few months I had him. It can be a little exhausting, but it worked for me.

When he would see anything that triggered him, the moment he became excited (he would do these scream whines), we immediately moved further away from the dog/squirrel/plastic bag.  As soon as the whining stopped, we immediately turned back around to go closer to the object of excitement. Repeat as soon as whining starts again. 

He caught on pretty quick to whining takes me further away from object and quiet gets me closer. Once we had established him being quiet regularly upon objects of excitement, I started to do the same thing for his overly excited body language. 

Then when  I could finally walk without him tearing my arm off for every dog or squirrel he saw, I started trying to work on his tunnel vision issues. He was an angel in the apartment and was very focused on me and could do anything asked of him, but get him outside and I stopped existing. So we started working on stopping when he got excited, sitting, and not moving again until he looked me in the eyes. (high value treats helped).

 It's exhausting to take a walk and constantly have to go back and forth, but it worked for us!",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/v2xohg/any_advice_on_why_my_dog_cries_like_this_when_he/#iavuz3k,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Ugh, sorry, I know that feeling all too well. Our shelter dog was never crate trained and we thought we were taking it real slow until I tried to leave him for over an hour and he broke out. It really is a horrible feeling because you feel like you’ve failed your dog and yourself. Based on the best practice reading I did after that incident, we’ve gone back to basics. Here’s what we did:

-Made the crate more comfortable by adding a second pad. This helped right away.

-upped the value of the treats we were giving for going in. It was beggin strips, now it’s cheese and peanut butter. Once we did that he finally started going in on command, rather than us having to pretend to throw a treat in there to get him to go inside. 

-Closing him in at night to sleep in the crate. 

-Scheduling crate time that was NOT connected to us leaving. For example every time I sweep the floors I will put him in his crate now. Every time I walk him I’ll put him in the crate for a bit afterwards. That way he doesn’t always think crate = owners are leaving. 

It’s frustrating when the dog doesn’t get it right away, but I think especially after a failed attempt like this, you just need to be patient and know that it’s a conditioning game. The crate has to become something positive rather than negative for the dog or it will always find a way to break out.

My dog is a rescue and the vet wasn't sure. Best guesses are border collie mixed with corgi or beagle or dachshund.... 

I was told about DNA tests but also how inaccurate they are. I only know 1 person who did it and she said it was a waste of money. I guess she did two different ones because the first one was wrong. She knew the mother, she got it from the owner who had the mom as well, but the father was unknown. So the test didn't show up the one breed she did know. The second one I think did but honestly I don't remember now. Just that she said they aren't always accurate.

,"Is there a room you can put her in or go in yourself? I think you need a barrier between you when this happens. Even though you aren’t actively tugging back this behavior seems pretty self rewarding so I think removing yourself is the answer. After a bit if you go back out and they continue the behavior just separate again for a bit. I think that’ll help them get the idea that if the behavior continues so does the separation from you. I’m tempted to say you should redirect to a toy, but I know that can be tricky because they may continue to go for your clothes instead but that could be worth trying.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/v3mp8w/can_someone_please_help_i_explain_more_in_the/#iazmuog,,,,,,,,,,,,

We’ve started to work on a “chill” or “enough” command when our girl starts getting too excited while playing ( it’s really good practice for when we see our nieces and nephews). 

It’s kind of like leave it, but for an activity. We started training her by turning away (or maybe in your case, leaving the room), saying “chill,” calmly, and then rewarding calm behavior.  If she doesn’t calm down, we leave and disengage. That way she can learn that play stops when she’s too much.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/v3mp8w/can_someone_please_help_i_explain_more_in_the/#iazn745,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I'm going to start by pointing out that you're doing a lot right here: you're not panicking or labelling this as aggression. You understand what it is. That's a good starting point, now we just need to figure out how to 1-prevent it and 2-react when it does occur.

For prevention, a lot of this will just be boredom. Giving your dog something to do throughout the day in terms of both enrichment and exercise will help. Take long sniffy walks, you said they're smart and food motivated? Start teaching them more tricks, look into rally obedience (you can do this all at home for free), use puzzle feeders (wrapping their meal up in a towel or scatter feeding will also work). Make sure they are getting in some exercise where they get to run everyday, this can be on a long line of needed. They like to tug so practice having them do a stay while you walk as far as possible and call them to run and grab a tug you for a game with you.

You'll also have to work on how to deal with the behavior when it does happen. In the long run you want to do this by teaching a drop it. Get something that's appropriate to tug with, a toy, a rope, whatever. Then start playing. Once you have a good tug going just stop, get super boring. Your dog will eventually get bored or confused and let go. Mark that and reward by going right back into tug. Once they understand the game start adding in your drop it cue. That will help you manage this behaviour when it does happen. 

You can also work on helping them learn to control their energy level to match yours. A good way to do this is to essentially get hyped up, let them match your hype level, and then just instantly calm down. Reward them for calming down to match you. Start off doing this will just a little excitement, and build up to getting really really excited. 

Having an escape route can also help. You can just set up a tall baby gate at the door if that will stop them so you can step out of the room. Otherwise you may need to managing to close the door and seperate yourself from the dog for a few seconds (same technique used for puppy biting, essentially any chomping and the fun human just disappears).",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/v3mp8w/can_someone_please_help_i_explain_more_in_the/#iaztlmm,,,,,,,,,,,,

You are trying to get away from her, but she should be the one backing away from you, otherwise it just invites her into your space.

The moment you stopped moving your arm and stopped engaging with her, she. stopped. You dropped you arm and stayed still and quiet, you were no longer trying to get away or telling her “no”, you simply dropped your arm, stopped moving, and waited. Do that and it will tell her it’s not allowed because you aren’t allowing her to get you engaged with her.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/v3mp8w/can_someone_please_help_i_explain_more_in_the/#ib01pew,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"When you hold on, it becomes a game of tug. Disengage and try to redirect to a suitable toy. This may mean letting her pants you!

Do not put any tension into the object so it can't become a game, and don't give her attention so she learns that she only gets attention and playing when she uses appropriate behavior.

Pivot to grabbing a toy and shaking it around. If she drops what she's trying to tug in favor of the toy, praise her like crazy so she learns that she gets attention and playing when she uses the toy, but she gets nothing when she tugs on other items in the house. If she looks like she wants to tug your pants but grabs the toy instead, give her tons of praise for choosing the right behavior!

"Advice on how to prevent our dog from going after the dropped food at our toddler’s high chair? Pretty sure my wife is going to get rid of our dog soon if I can’t resolve this.
Our two year old basenji loves to hang around the high chair when we’re feeding our toddler in hopes of scooping up any dropped morsels. But the real problem is that she then jumps up to snatch things on the tray of the high chair, or sticks her head up between baby’s legs to get at any food that’s been dropped there.

My wife has no tolerance for this and is basically past trying to fix the problem, her reaction is usually to yell, push our dog away, and after a while of that not working resort to locking our dog in another room. Our dog then pees on the floor because she has pretty bad anxiety, and I’m left to clean a mess and feel stressed about the whole situation. I’m usually cooking dinner while this is going on, so up to now one thing I’ve tried is to get our dog to sit and wait at my feet and periodically reward her with treats. But it’s tough to keep that up nonstop while preparing a meal, so she’ll eventually wander over and jump up at baby’s tray anyway.

My wife is at home with the baby and dog all day while I’m at work, and there are several behavioural issues that she’s left to deal with that have driven her to the point of wanting to rehome our dog. But this is the most frequently recurring issue right now and the one that most often drives her to the point of declaring that she wants to get rid of the dog. 

There are other layers to this situation that I’m sure figure in to how I might go about curbing this behaviour, but I really just need some feedback and ideas at this point. I would be grateful for any advice anyone could offer.

Edit: There’s been a lot of great advice, thanks so much everyone. Working on some late-night deadlines right now and don’t have time to respond to everyone, but will definitely be reading every comment and replying if I can. I’ll be sure to post an update when we’ve had a chance to implement some of this advice and let everyone know how it’s been going.

Edit 2: There’s been a lot of criticism of my wife’s attitude and reaction towards the situation so I’m adding a bit of context: to be honest the situation is just more complicated than I had the time or mental energy to fully describe in the original post.

We were initially both very committed to training her. Then a LOT changed. Covid hit. We got pregnant. She was finishing an incredibly stressful studio-based master’s degree which was suddenly online. It eventually became clear that our pup had pretty severe anxiety, probably worsened by the restrictions in place which meant she couldn’t be properly socialized (we were fully locked down, no parks open at all for her first few months at home).

The situation became too much for my wife and we agreed that I would take on the majority of the responsibility for our dog; it’s been my decision to shoulder that burden and try to make things work rather than rehoming her. Everything considered, my wife has been very patient with us.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/smg5rj/advice_on_how_to_prevent_our_dog_from_going_after/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"When our pup was young, we had some minor troubles with him getting in the way in the kitchen (always at our feet) - so we taught him ""go to your spot"", his spot being somewhere out of the way but still close enough where he could see us and hang out with us.

This is also a common tactic people use when they sit down to eat - they train their dog to go lay in their bed etc because otherwise they beg or are a nuisance.

Another option is simply gating off the kitchen during baby feeding time. So dog isn't locked away and anxious, but can watch all the action.

I think it will be tough to immediately ""untrain"" the behavior your dog has learned without full support from your wife, and constant supervision, because it's been very rewarding for her thus far. So instead of focusing on directly stopping her high chair robbery, I think it would be more productive to focus on a convenient way of preventing her access to the high chair, while separately working on a ""place""/""go to your spot"" command.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/smg5rj/advice_on_how_to_prevent_our_dog_from_going_after/#hvwhiu7,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Yep there’s no secret here, you can’t expect a dog to just know not to take the food because it’s the baby who dropped it. Control the environment, put him away, use baby fences if needed.

When I cook I tell my dogs to stay on the other half of the kitchen because I know that if I allow them to stay at my feet, they will try to eat anything that falls down. After I’m done cooking, I go and reward them but only if they’re on the right side of the kitchen, lying down and calm. I never ever allowed them to snatch food off the counters so they never did it, absolutely make it impossible for him to do that ever again. Don’t let food on tables and put him away when your wife is feeding baby, reward him when he’s being a good boy.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/smg5rj/advice_on_how_to_prevent_our_dog_from_going_after/#hvwkts4,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basenjis are a primitive breed and not really like other dogs. They have been described as a cross between a cat and a monkey. They are very stubborn and don't always respond well to yelling. They don't like to be separated from their people. Your dog needs a job while the baby is eating.

"level 4(?) bite, no warning. Need advice please
Our 2-3 year old, 90 lb rescue dog bit a visitor ""D"" last night. D held his hand out in greeting (he did not approach, just held his hand out) and our dog approached, sniffed, and then lunged and bit with no warning, visitor needed 5-6 stitches. The dog has met ""D"" before and was fine, relaxed and no apparent fear. 

&#x200B;

Backstory. We got this dog from a rescue last fall. I tried to be clear that we were looking for an easy going, sociable dog. We got a very poorly socialized, fearful dog. He has snapped at multiple people. We've previously managed introductions to new people by telling them to not to approach the dog and just let him take things at his own pace. This has gone okay, and sometimes he warms up to people great and is sociable and relaxed. He has snapped at several men though, usually after he approaches them. He's great with myself and my partner. 

&#x200B;

Last night, we were expecting two couples over for a BBQ. He has met both couples before and while he's been fearful with one of the men ""B"" (E.g. has snapped several times), he was okay last night with ""B"" with a controlled introduction (and high value treats). My partner was outside with the dog, but was not paying attention when the second couple showed up. ""B"" was outside grilling with the dog observing, my partner was in another part of the yard. ""B"" warned ""D"" that dog may be feeling nervous, and as stated, ""D"" put his hand out and our dog sniffed, lunged, and bit him. ""D"" left to go get stitches, he needed 5-6. 

&#x200B;

Obviously we failed in managing this introduction, I thought my partner was paying attention. I don't know what to do, I feel like sending this dog back to the rescue would be horribly traumatic for him but I also don't feel like we can handle a dog with this kind of history. My partner seems to not really think this a huge deal and we'll just kennel him anytime we have people over, but I have serious misgivings.

If you take on the responsibility of keeping this dog I would heavily consider keeping it muzzled at all times while in public, and when you have any company over.

,"I adopted a dog last year, we were told how easy going he was and then he went on to attack me (and when I say attack I mean literally chase me to bite me) and my partner. He tried to attack strangers on the streets and anyone who moved the wrong way. The shelter was incredibly irresponsible as it was clear they had a hard time rehoming. He also ended up with serious SA so couldn't go anywhere, and even though he was apparently muzzle trained he would escape out of all of them and then proceed to resource guard the muzzle. Needless to say, we sent him packing. I am sure people reading this will think I am heartless using that phrase, but I simply could not love a dog who always wanted to hurt me or my family, so I now lack the empathy, and that upsets me that I have such a dislike for him now in contrast to how much I thought I loved him when he was first adopted.

What I will say is this: don't be me, and end it on a good note with this one while this bite is your only incident. You get a dog to fit around your life, and not the other way around. The opposite end is for people who work with dogs as their career. You would be totally forgiven for swallowing your heart here and returning the dog. If that dog continues to seriously injure people or worse, you are liable. Even with a behaviourist, this will be a long (and expensive) uphill battle.

You think you are at fault for failing to manage the introduction. ONE more failure like that, and you may be sued, and/or responsible for a very serious injury. Hand injuries are very serious. I agree with you. Only a professional can handle a dog like this. Maybe there is a slim change that a behavioral quirk can be fixed with insightful training, but I think the risk is too great.

,">He has snapped at multiple people.

Now that the dog has shown that he will bite, and will mean it, you have a few choices. 

One is keep the dog and don't, under any circumstances, allow him to interact with any people who are not you and your partner. Do not try to see if he's better, or assume he likes so-and-so. People come over, this dog is in a crate, in a locked room, and no introductions are made, ever, for any reason. When you walk him, or take him anywhere, he needs to, again with no exceptions, be muzzled. 

Don't let anyone tell you that with some tasty yummy treats, you will be able to make this dog safe around strangers. The risk is just huge. 

Or you return him to the rescue group, with full disclosure. While they may foster him to adopt him out again, odds are they will euthanize him. 


The fact that he's 90 pounds, means that if he bites again, he has a good chance of permanently injuring someone, or worse. 

Do you guys rent or own? Owning this dog, going forward, could make a devastating impact on your finances if you own,  or ability to find a rental if you do rent. 

>My partner thinks this would be a massive trauma for the dog, he was very unhappy and stressed at the rescue. My partner also thinks it would be a disservice to any future adopters as we are not sure if the rescue would fully disclose things to future adopters.

I understand what your partner is saying, but the bottom line is, a dog who bit under those circumstances, especially a big dog, is just a huge liability to keep on as a pet. 

You guys have to weigh that. Keep the dog and understand the risks of keeping the dog, and what you need to do to keep everyone safe, or return the dog to rescue, feel awful about it, but don't lose your home or your apartment over it.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/vraz5b/level_4_bite_no_warning_need_advice_please/#ieueq1c,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Let’s be real: the rescue lied to you and placed a dog with huge behavior issues who likely lacked proper socialization as a puppy and may be from suspect breeding. They really absolutely dropped the ball here. You can work with a behavioralist, but be aware that this likely will cost in the thousands of dollars to see any improvement at all. And you will likely never have the dog you asked for- it will always be a matter of tolerating and managing these issues. If you’ve really strongly bonded with this dog and are willing to spend up to the next 10 or more years living your life where you’re having to manage this dog with issues, no one will stop you and that’s very kind and generous, but if it were me and the dog were something I’d recently brought home, I’d really REALLY be considering giving it back to the rescue. This dog should not have been placed in your home, and frankly a dog who acts like this is a good candidate for behavioral euthanasia. Perhaps progress can be made, but it’s the rare person who has the desire and knowledge to manage a dog like this, and it’s clear to me that this is absolutely not what you signed up for. It disgusts that so many rescues pretty much entrap ignorant people who really only want a nice family pet with these nightmare dogs who are going to have severe issues against the adopter’s wishes. I don’t think this is a problem that can be “fixed” in the sense you have a trainer spend a few hours with you and you’ll have an entirely different dog. This dog will always require a lot of work, management, and delicate touch to ensure your own safety and those you bring into your home, and likely isn’t a dog who can be in public and do normal dog things. It’s up to you to decide if that’s really the situation you want to find yourself in and if you have the time and money to invest into getting “ok” results. If it were me, I would not have a dog that bit unpredictably in my home.

"My puppy will not stop pulling on walks. Trainer's advice doesn't seem to be working.
Hello dog lovers!

I have an 11 m. o. Australian Shepherd mix. He just completed a 6-week basic obedience training course. The trainer taught us to stop whenever the dog starts pulling. Once he looks back at me and starts walking back towards me, he gets a click and a treat, and we resume walking.

As soon as he gets his treat, he runs right back to where he was and starts pulling again. We've been working on it for 6-8 weeks, and while I've seen definite improvement, he still isn't where I'd like him to be. On the rare occasions he does stay next to me while walking, I give constant praise and more treats. But the good behavior is gone by the next day.

Last week, I started making him come back to me and walk next to me for a few seconds before clicking and giving the treat. That doesn't seem to be helping much. 

I walk him before he eats breakfast and sometimes we go on a second walk before lunch. 

Does leash walking normally take longer to get the hang of? I'm worried that he isn't understanding what I want him to do and I'm just confusing the poor thing. Or am I just being impatient? TIA!",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/mu11ec/my_puppy_will_not_stop_pulling_on_walks_trainers/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"That method never ever worked for me. Luckily, I took it from the Internet and once we hired a trainer, her suggestion gave us night and day results!

We taught her Touch (come to palm of hand and boop with nose) and Watch (make eye contact). Lots of treats and lots of clicking during the training, and then we took her on a walk. 

Every time she starts to go somewhere I don’t want her to, I use Touch. Every time she tries to reach the end of her leash, I use Watch. This keeps her constantly engaged (and getting treats at times) so she stays close. It has worked wonderfully. We still do it to make sure she keeps the habit, but she pretty much doesn’t pull anymore.

If she is being particularly stubborn, I bring her to me, tell her to sit, give it a few seconds, and start walking again. That usually “resets” her.

Hope it helps!",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/mu11ec/my_puppy_will_not_stop_pulling_on_walks_trainers/#gv375di,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"That method never actually worked for me. However, what did was when the dog pulls, you say “let’s go” and then turn and walk the opposite direction. It has to be immediate, though, in order to get the point across. Then of course continue to praise and treat when the dog is walking where you’d like them to.

After a ton of repetition, that’s what I found worked for my dog. Might be worth a shot.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/mu11ec/my_puppy_will_not_stop_pulling_on_walks_trainers/#gv2zj3j,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"There’s lots of great advice here and I support it all. But I also wanted to suggest this:

Ask yourself the question of what your dog wants! Does he want to sniff? Has he had enough “sniff time” today? Is he curious about something and wants to inspect it? If it’s not dangerous, maybe you can let him! Has he had enough exercise (running, fetch, play, etc.) today? If not, maybe try and play a couple round of fetch to see if that helps!

My pup often pulls when he hasn’t had enough physical or mental stimulation. So we make sure to work his nose and muscles before taking him on a walk, and he’s usually a dream. He’s naturally curious so we are okay with him on a six foot lead sniffing around and he will follow up. If he doesn’t follow, then we give him our verbal cue (“let’s go”) and he follows.

Of course, if the dog is pulling to see another dog or a person then that’s a different issue, but I’ve found this has helped us a lot with trying to communicate with him and makes all of our lives easier!",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/mu11ec/my_puppy_will_not_stop_pulling_on_walks_trainers/#gv3bxja,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I see a lot of the walk the other way method on here which may work, but just seemed to confuse my dogs and make walking really annoying for me. The method that changed everything for me and had my dogs tuned up and walking loose leash 95% of the time was the Monks of New Skete's method.

Go to an open field and, similar to some of the other methods, say ""Let's go"" and start walking, but unlike some of the other methods that go pull --> opposite direction, immediately start walking in unpredictable patterns. Start with wide figure eights, circles, zig zags, giving your dog constant little warnings of ""lets go"" when ever you're about to change direction again. This turned it into a fun game and instead of training a behavior OUT of a dog (pulling), which is difficult, it trained a new behavior IN (look to my human to see where we're going next).

Because the dog has to ""stay on their toes"" to avoid getting left behind or almost stepped on, it creates an alert state that's focused on you instead of too much stuff around them. Mix in praise and treats when they stay well with you, and do some repetitions of this before you go on a real walk (after initial training sessions) and I saw a crazy huge improvement in both my dogs.

Hope it works for you too as I found it was a really fun, non-frustrating training method.

ETA: both my dogs are aussies as well and i think they responded well to the light brainwork in this method as opposed to most methods which rely on impulse control alone :)",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/mu11ec/my_puppy_will_not_stop_pulling_on_walks_trainers/#gv3coiu,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It doesn't work because your dog initiates the sequence of behaviours that leads to food. Here is what happens:

Dog Pulls -> You Stop -> Dog Returns -> Click -> Treat Delivered

If I was your dog, and I was clever, I would know that pulling = food, and that immediately after I eat food, I should return to pulling.

For positive reinforcement training to work YOU must initiate the sequence of behaviours OR the behaviour your dog does is desirable. Try instead:

Dog looks at you while moving -> Click -> Treat Delivered  
You Cue ""Let's Go"" and move -> Dog follows you -> Click -> Treat Delivered

Hopefully you can see the difference. 

What your trainer has done isn't wrong (I actually teach the same thing), but it's somehow gotten taken out of context. The stop/return exercise teaches your dog to return to position. It's taught with food initially to establish the behaviour but then, when using it in ""real life"" on walks, it has to be switched up. Once your dog has return to position down we actually use negative punishment (removal of reinforcement) to weaken pulling behaviour. Adding reinforcement to this protocol basically ruins it as you have discovered. Here's what it SHOULD look like (this assumes the food step has been completed)

Dog Pulls to get to park/tree/person etc -> Human Stops (removal of access to reinforcer ahead) -> dog returns to position -> Human continues walk (access to reinforcer ahead is available again, while dog is in correct position).",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/mu11ec/my_puppy_will_not_stop_pulling_on_walks_trainers/#gv3fynl,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"11 months is slap bang in the middle of adolescence. You've absolutely got to be on top of behaviours. He's going to try everything to see what he can get away with.

Think about what he's actually learning. He's probably learning that pulling gets him treats, since it makes you stop, and that's the cue that he's going to get a treat. I've found that the best anti-pulling solutions actually don't involve rewards (at least not immediately). To put it as simply as possible, you want to remove the unwanted behaviour (the pulling), then fill the resulting void with the wanted behaviour (walking at your side ).

I would talk about the 'turn' method, where you walk in the opposite direction, but that's already been mentioned. I find it far more effective than stopping, since you're actually adding consequences to the pulling. The dog pulls to go somewhere, but instead of getting him a treat, it gets him *further away* from where he's trying to go. That's **negative punishment.** It sounds bad and horrible, but it's really not. It's basically reducing a behaviour by taking away something good.

The dog should pick up on this relatively quickly, and *hopefully* (given adolescence) he should stop pulling as much. With the 'behavioural void' caused by this, you can then fill it with the wanted behaviour, since he's no longer misbehaving. *Now* is when you give him praise for walking next to you. Over time, he should improve with it, but you need to be consistent, and you need to be on top of it.

It's one of those issues that's best dealt with when you can see the dog in person, as it requires pretty good timing and you really need to *see* how the dog behaves, so all I can do is give you that advice.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/mu11ec/my_puppy_will_not_stop_pulling_on_walks_trainers/#gv32nge,,,,,,,,,,,,

With any behavior, you need to start in a low distraction environment first, which means you should work on leash skills in your house first.

Trust me it can take awhile. Lots of stopping, this way, sit, click, release. My neighbours must think I'm nuts. Also many changes of direction and crossing the road for no reason. You need to trick your dog into thinking there is no end goal or straight line direction so they're always looking at you for guidance.

,"I'm not going to lie, it took forever to get my dog to stop pulling. Months. Then we moved and he started back up again and it took another few months to get him to stop again. He's very stubborn and overly aware of his environment.

I would randomly change directions so he'd have to pay attention to me first. Kept multiple levels of treats handy, the everyday treat and a very high value treat. Stay aware of anything I think he might become interested in and pull his attention to me before whatever it is grabs his attention first. If something does catch his attention and he starts to pull I stop and don't move until he comes back. He doesn't get to go to that very interesting thing until I say so. If we start moving and he pulls again then I stop again. If he does it a third time then we turn around and take a different route. The only way he gets to the thing he wants to get to is by controlling himself. 

I have had trainers suggest a spatula dipped in frozen peanut butter as a way to train him to walk next to me. I did do that when I put his boots on him for the first time, but felt it was too much for every walk since we walk 3x per day for 30-45 min each.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/mu11ec/my_puppy_will_not_stop_pulling_on_walks_trainers/#gv33gb4,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I feel like a lot of the time owners don’t do a great job at advocating for their older dogs when puppies are being obnoxious, but honestly in this clip I feel like the older dog is the one being a bit of an ass. Pup looks like it’s just minding its business - not bothering the older dog, not trying to take toys or anything, respecting the older dog’s space - and the older dog appears to be bossing it around because it can. I assume the older dog feels there’s something valuable at stake here, but it’s unclear what exactly from this short video. 

I would start off with separating them as soon as the older dog displays this behavior (ideally not having them loose together in general until this problem is resolved). At the very least, both dogs on-leash so you have a handle on them in case the older dog tries to escalate the situation. Going on mutual walks with the two of them (ideally with a person to handle each dog) would be a good way to practice casual interaction/proximity in a reinforcing way. I would spend time with both dogs on leash practicing basic obedience in each others’ vicinity (lots of sits, downs, etc.) and rewarding each dog for giving you engagement & ignoring the other dog. I feel this is honestly a situation best assessed & given an opinion on from a trainer (I’m not one lol) but that’s just where I would start personally. I do find this behavior a bit concerning since the older dog seems to be going out of its way to get in the pup’s space and you never know when one or the other may decide to escalate the situation - pups change as they mature & it may decide one day that it’s had enough (my ACD pup, for example, has gained a lot of grit/boldness as she’s grown & has a lot more of a “FAFO” attitude as a current 8 mo old).",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/twv2ua/weve_had_the_puppy_4_mo_for_2_months_now_and_my/#i3iwk9z,,,,,,,,,,,,

- For a short period every day, while he has a kong or other high value chew, crack your window. Let him hear the city in smaller doses while he's having fun.  
- Walk with another confident dog friend, preferably one he knows and trusts.  
- Get an adaptil collar and keep it snug on him.  
- Set up his bed in an interior area with no sights or sounds of the city. That will probably require white noise like a fan, at least. White noise near the dog and masking noise (tv, rock music, etc) near the door/window is usually a winning combination. It's important that he gets enough sleep time and that he sleeps deeply, to recover from stress.
- Talk to your vet about doggy prozac. Do it early--it's not a last resort, it's an early step that makes training and conditioning progress much much easier going forward.
- Set up a toilet area for him on a balcony if possible, so he doesn't have to go out several times every day. Ideally you would let him decompress for a couple of days in between exposure to the scary thing (city outside) but understood that that's hard to do.    
- Walk to a destination. Something he can look forward to. In the beginning it might be something you manufacture like a particular bench or fire hydrant where you always stop and give him a piece of hamburger. In the longer term it might be a pet shop or a doggy friend or a park. 
- Make sure he gets to play every day. Play inside. Encourage him to be goofy and silly. tug of war, wrestling, fetch, chase, hide and seek, whatever gets him excited. Err on the side of not accidentally overwhelming him, so if there's any chasing or contact he should be the one coming at you, not you coming at him.

I moved to the city from the suburbs about 3 months ago. He has been skittish around cars since I got him (about a year ago). We moved to the city and he was fine for a while but the past few weeks he’s been so anxious about going outside. I can’t point to any particular event that may have caused this other than just hearing new/loud noises when we go out. It’s gotten pretty bad. I try to keep our walks short, just around the block to not overwhelm him, but I will still take him for longer walks bc he needs the exercise. When we are out all he wants to do is go home. He’ll pull until we get back to the door to go inside. I want him to feel comfortable but he won’t take food, or engage in play when we are outside. 

I just want him to be comfortable and have fun outside. He loves people and dogs. I’ll open the window in my apartment to help expose him to sounds when we are inside but they don’t seem to bother him inside. I’ve also tried sitting on a bench and letting him just sit and process the environment but this only seems to make him more anxious and he doesn’t settle (I’ve waited about an hour and a half but he just whines and tries to walk away). Does anyone have suggestions or tips??",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/mf4q66/anxious_outside_any_advice_is_welcome/#gslfkeh,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"That same exact thing happened to my pup. She was always a bit skittish outside but would go for walks and play outside away from the busy street we live on. But one day we were playing and it was like her second fear stage smacked her in the face. She immediately dropped the ball and bolted for our front door. The week or so after that I had to physically pick her up and bring her outside because I didn’t know what else to do. She just would not go outside. So I called a trainer. I was at a loss and she told me: 

1) if you act weird because your dog is acting weird it’s going to freak them out even more. So pretend like everything is normal (as much as possible). You want them to trust you so your confidence is a big factor too. I learned this the hard way which is why I bring this up.

2) Know their limits but also push them just a little bit each time to walk a little bit further. The trainer told me you don’t want to break their trust but you do need to push them just a little bit. It’s a very fine (and tough) line to draw. 

3) Try building up their confidence inside with toys. This trainer specifically recommended a ball on a rope. Play tug of war and let them see you’re struggling (like “oh man! You’re so strong!”) and let them win. It sounds super silly but let me tell you, it helped with our pup big time. She was back outside in 2 weeks. Full confidence. 

Those are the things that helped our dog, I hope they can help yours as well! Also I’m really sorry because I know how frustrating and concerning this behavior can be. You got this!",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/mf4q66/anxious_outside_any_advice_is_welcome/#gsmaj0j,,,,,,,,,,,,

Washable belly bands indoors were a godsend for the latter, but the former was eventually resolved by progressively longer walks after acclimating to the neighborhood and noise level. He wasn’t leash trained so starting there and using positive reinforcements and treats definitely helped, but I think one of the things that really helped more than that was the understanding that he had been through some things before i adopted him, and that was the likely culprit of his anxiety. Working on building resiliency with him and sitting on a corner with my hand on his chest telling him he’s good, and ok, until his heart stopped racing when he was afraid, until he was ready to move forward continues to be a tool that I’m using to help overcome some behaviors and situations where he’s overwhelmed with panic.

"Rescue Aussie will not come near me inside when standing or moving, otherwise she's attached to my hip - any advice?
My wife and I foster-failed an 18 month old Aussie a year ago. She is the sweetest thing. She will crawl into my lap when I sit on the couch, cuddle in bed at night time, play out in the yard and have the time of her life, she will even shove her head under my hand for pets to the point where her nickname has become “shovel head”. 

The problem is, she will not come near me inside the house if I am standing. If we are on the couch together and I stand up, she will go run into the hallway. If she is in the living room and I walk in, she will hop off the couch and run out of the room, wait for me to sit, then come back. She has a little bit more courage with my wife, but not much more. She is terrified of strangers and hates walking.

She has made SO much improvement since joining our family and we are so proud of her. She used to cower under the bed, she would submissive pee, and not come near us at all. She takes a long time to warm up to people and that is totally OK as we respect her boundaries.

We recently had to euthanize our older Aussie that she got to spend the last year with. We had him since he was a puppy and he was my soul dog. We did everything together, I taught him every trick in the book - he was my shadow and was so brilliant and eager to learn/please. 

I want to give her the same great life as our late Aussie if she is willing. Any advice on how to move forward with her? I wanted to give her time and space to warm up to her home but after a year she is still timid with movement, which breaks my heart thinking about her past. Any advice is welcome!

TLDR: Rescue Aussie glued to our hip outdoors or sitting inside. Terrified if we get up or enter a room she is in. Never trained with a dog with a damaged past - any advice on how to proceed with her?

EDIT: SO much great advice here I just wanted to say thank you to everyone. Really looking forward to working through this with her",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1i1cjzy/rescue_aussie_will_not_come_near_me_inside_when/,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can keep some soft, yummy treats (string cheese works really well for this) on you during the day, and toss one or two toward her whenever you go from sitting to standing and when you're walking around. she may begin to associate you standing/moving with good things and become less afraid over time.

,"You need to do some exploration here - what is it specifically she’s scared of is the aim of the game. What happens if you crawl into the room? What happens if you tip toe in? What happens if you enter, then leave? What happens if you stand on the dining table? I sound crazy, but is it:
Height
Sound
Movement
Or combo. Sounds like it might be height and movement - possibly someone tall maybe used to step on her/ her tail if not docked? I’m assuming here your wife is shorter than you (she may also move more quietly).

Once you know that - say it IS height and stepping that’s the problem… crawl into the room. Drop treats, leave again. Do that a few times a day for a week or so (you may find as soon as she hears you shuffling she’s up looking for treats!). Then… walk in on your knees (a bit taller/ a bit louder). She may regress again, but keep at it. Hopefully you get the idea! You are wanting to get her used to “owner entering room is great” while also get her used to someone tall walking into the room NOT being scary. Potentially also do a standing treat fly by to save your knees (ie, walk to the doorway, toss treat, leave. Walk one step into room with dog, toss treat, leave). The leave is important! You want to introduce scary thing, give reinforcements, remove scary thing.

"Advice on Desensitizing Dog
Hi all. I have a 4 month Border Collie that is very afraid of school buses and garbage trucks. Specifically she seems afraid of the hydraulic sounds.
I found a YouTube video that plays the sound thinking I would play it at the smallest volume while we play in the house to try to desensitize her. I tried it once but she stopped playing immediately and ran to a corner. The volume was low enough I couldn't even hear it.

My question is, how do I make those sounds not scary to her? Was my plan a bad plan that will just make her feel less safe in our house or will it eventually lead to a dog who will see that the sound isn't associated with anything that is harmful and will begin to treat it as not important?",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1i66b7o/advice_on_desensitizing_dog/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"A truck started parking across the road from my house with all the noises. It would idle for ages, and had the air brakes. The dogs would go nuts and get really stressed, and this guy was coming home at 2 in the morning so it wasn't great. 

I started saying ""truck"" as soon as I heard it, and talking them through it to reassure them like: ""It's ok, it's just the stoopid truck"" (I use 'stoopid' for anything annoying like flies or a particular neighbour). I also began mimicking the brake sound and pairing that with the word truck, and laughing at myself because it sounded so stupid which lightened the mood and they seemed to pick up on that. It took a few nights but gradually they would bark less until they got used to it. 

I was really glad it worked because not long after they started doing roadworks nearby and parking all the trucks and heavy machinery across the road.

,"I have a BC mix that was terrified of everything. Sounds, boxes, closets, his own reflection and shadow. At 8 weeks he was just quivering mush, the poor dear. I've done different things, for sounds I ignore his reaction and just remain calm. I allowed him to hide by me and just put mt back to the scary sound or thing. He still barks at the garbage truck, but he recovers quickly. Boxes, I started getting bark boxes... he is totally over his fear of boxes now. He will always be cautious, but he is 2 now and he has gained so much confidence. Socialize, i dont mean other dogs, i mean just the neighborhood. People in hats, old people with walkers. He still thinks that big black dog in the mirror is sketchy, but he is not hiding under the couch. Of course he's half Mastiff and no longer fits under the couch. If the dog is afraid, move back until the reaction is gone. Sit quietly,  play games, do obedience.  Move just a hair closer, repeat. He'll get there. 

Expose your pup in a safe environment. The more they trust you, the more confidence they gain. Get them out in a busy environment, but off a bit. Maybe a park by a construction site. You need to flip the script. Don't try to soothe their fears. That actually gets them more worked up. Keep your emotions in check, do not show concern, fear or worry. They WILL pick up on that. My Bear is the first dog I've had that is afraid of fireworks. But he's gone from hiding in the furthest smallest place he could fit, and just shaking, to just barking at them. I'd prefer him to not react at all, but we'll get there. Building their confidence is the best way to alleviate fear reactions.

,"Is your dog normally a happy go lucky dog or a sensitive/anxious dog? You can desensitize and counter-condition, but it can be more difficult with an anxious dog, in my experience. 

If your dog is sensitive/anxious, I think teaching the dog to relax would be beneficial and a necessary precursor to desensitization. Dr. Karen Overall's Relaxation Protocol is great. 

It's also important to work on relationship and trust with your dog. If you were to walk your dog past the scary garbage truck or school bus, the dog may learn that you can't be trusted, especially when the dog wants to run away but is prevented from doing so by a leash that you are holding.

It seems like your dog is hyper sensitive to the sound, so exposure to the triggering sound should only happen when dog is eating high value treats such as steak.

,"Oof, collies are great for this type of thing. I have a collie cross and I swear I can play the audio of the first note of the Amazon ring doorbell and he immediately is up to 11 guard dog mode at the door.

I think you're on the right track. It is actually in a way a good thing she is reacting poorly to the audio alone, it means you can work on that away from the real thing. I would be introducing the low audio as you are, WHEN she is already in a good mood, maybe play is occuring or treat time. She will get scared, that's fine, you can see does she snap out of it with continued activity or does she need to reboot. If the latter, take a break, come back and do it again. She's seeing the pattern that the noise goes away, nobody dies. The play before hand is to just give her a help to be less likely to have the strongest reaction.

You could also introduce the noise just before food, or before a walk. Unless she gets into super fear pee yourself mode (I've never done this with a dog that fearful) consistently hearing the noise, I bet you money that within 2-3 days she will get excited by the noise. The noise means good things. The noise is as good as the word walkies.

Once she gets ok with the noise I would next put my attention to the authentic noise in real life outside.  You'll probably see a set back as compared to the simulated noise, but hopefully she won't be as bad as before. I had this with a collie afraid of double Decker busses. She would cower when they went past and initially try to pull me back home. It took time, we had some walks we wouldn't see the bus, that would fuel her love of walks for the next time the bus was there. I didn't give her treats although that might distract some dogs. With her I would actually just point out the bus in my excited walkie voice, and encourage a bit more forward momentum in the walk to get to the park. Don't forget if you jog a bit past a collie their instinct will be to chase or get ahead of you, that keeps the momentum and switches away from the scary vehicle a bit.

If you are really lucky you might hear the real noise outside from your home, that could get you to transition to tackling the real noise nicely. Dump truck outside? Food or treat time. Dump truck outside after a while of that? Where's the leash it's walkie time. 

If you persevere and if your dog isn't deathly afraid, I'm talking severe severe fear. Then I think you can make the noise fear a thing of the past completely. Collies are smarter than most dogs and seem to be able to be more stubborn and neurotic, so it can take time, plus a bit more.

I'll just add I've been in some frustrating situations with them all my life so I will also say it's important not to push too hard to get too emotional yourself. They pick up on all that and it turns a scary situation for them into a scary situation + your owner is annoyed/frustrated so it compounds the fear/anxiety. I'm not saying you're definitely like that, I'm just saying I've felt that in the past and it contributed nothing so solving the issue in the moment with a collie, or any dog",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1i66b7o/advice_on_desensitizing_dog/#m8djwv3,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, it must be difficult. Can you turn the volume even lower than you had it? Is there afield nearby that you could stand the opposite side of while the garbage trucks are on the other side? Is there other noise that’s she’s worried about? It’s very important to find the point at which she’s comfortable in order to desensitise. If she’s worried, she’s too close / it’s too loud and it could make he more sensitive.

"I am in desperate need of advice for my dog who resource guards.
I apologize in advance for the lengthy post but I’m so lost and overwhelmed with this situation. 

I have an almost 2 year old mix breed rescue dog that started resource guarding almost a year ago. Due to some issues with a landlord my fiancé and I were evicted at short notice and are now living with her mother. We have 2 other dogs one a full sibling from the same litter as him and 2 cats. Mother-in-law(mil) has a dog and a cat.

He was about 4 months old when we moved. I’ve had him from 4 days old because his mother tried to kill him, causing a bad wound so he is a bottle baby if that could be an issue. He was fixed at about 8 months. 

We believe he learned the behavior from my mil’s dog but I’m not sure if that is something that can cause it. Mil’s dog is Pomeranian Finnish spitz mix that is extremely reactive and growls/barks all the time. She won’t do anything about the behavior so any training we try to do with him is just canceled out (their dog also doesn’t act like that when they’re not home so I believe he knows they will let him get away with it). We want to help both dogs but I don’t know if it’s possible if they don’t keep up on their dog too. 

My dog now growls and gets antsy anytime he has food or treats. When it is close to feeding time he paces, whines, shakes, gets really tense, and overall shows a lot of anxiety and frustration with feeding. He stares us down intensely, watching every move we make waiting to see if his food bowl is being brought out. He has to eat from a slow feeder or he makes himself sick with how fast he eats. We’ve tried feeding him in a separate room with the door shut, feeding him in his kennel with it covered, feeding him last, making him wait and lay down completely before calling him to eat, I’ve tried calming supplements, anxiety medication from the vet, and so much more.

,"Given all his history, it's likely it's a genetic issue.   A stable female dog does not try to kill her puppies.  Poor temperaments are often inherited.  Issues like resource guarding and separation anxiety tend to escalate with age.   You can continue to manage the issue by isolating the dog during meal times and making sure you are not feeding until the dog is calm.  Hand feeding works with some.

,"So dogs don’t understand the concept of humans “letting them get away with things”. I’d highly recommend a positive reinforcement trainer that is familiar with multiple dog households. Please don’t try any shock collars, yelling, leash popping, ANY punishment as this will make it worse. Resource guarding and reactivity is almost always due to fear and this will either make it worse or lead to fallout (getting better and then getting 10x worse).",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1ig9vh2/i_am_in_desperate_need_of_advice_for_my_dog_who/#matjp7n,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"First, you need to figure out a way to minimize the behaviors. The only food he should get is his normal food, no more treats or goodies. No chews. Nothing he can guard.

Find a set up that will allow him to eat unbothered. I would personally get an automatic feeder. If he eats too fast then you can set up a smaller amount of food per feeding with more often feeding times. So, if he eats two cups of food a day then he would eat a half cup of food four times a day. I would put this in a room with low traffic. Maybe a spare bedroom or bathroom that you have. Make sure not to be around him when he's eating.

After that, I recommend a behaviorist. Resource guarding needs a lot of knowledge to be able to understand and handle, something that people on reddit could never offer. There's just too much that goes into it and someone needs to be in person to help you.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1ig9vh2/i_am_in_desperate_need_of_advice_for_my_dog_who/#matyw1z,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Can you explain the issue a bit more? You say that you've tried feeing him separately, but what happens? I'm not clear what the issue is here - he watches you (and is stressed) while you make his meal. Then what? Growls if you come near him while he eats? What happens if you put him in the kennel?",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1ig9vh2/i_am_in_desperate_need_of_advice_for_my_dog_who/#mau1mca,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"To confirm I understand the scope of the problem - it sounds like he does not resource guard towards humans, correct? How severe is his resource guarding towards other animals? Has he ever hurt another animal? Is the primary problem his obvious discomfort/anxiety, or do you think he is potentially a danger to the other animals? 

Management is key to start with. I'd continue feeding him separately and giving him treats separately as well. Many dogs really need to feel safe and secure while eating, and that's a reasonable thing to offer him. If he's crate-trained, you can give him meals and treats in the crate. Is his behavior okay when he eats alone? Or does he still show anxiety and resource guarding? 

Another idea: do you think he might be chronically hungry? My girl is a mild resource guarder but it's been a bit worse recently—and I realized that's probably because she's been on a diet for the past few months. Hunger can make resource guarding much worse. And hunger can be caused by diets, and medical problems (like poor nutrient absorbtion, or poor glucose management). A vet visit could be helpful. 

As far as training goes—it is trickier to work on training dog-to-dog resource guarding, but it there are some strategies. I would highly recommend working with a sklled professional because the details are so important.

Immediately much more calm in there and he couldn’t bust out (and stopped trying from the looks of it).

,"I adopted a 9 year old toy mutt back in April. Shelter didn't know his previous situation, he got transferred in from an out of state shelter, but whatever his history the poor little guy has severe anxiety. He's on daily prozac and trazodone, which makes him almost able to cope with being awake. It's very plain he loves attention and affection, but sometimes he just can't deal with being touched. And certainly not by anyone but me, ever. So it's been a long, slow road. We've made a huge amount of progress but he's still not ""normal"" and probably will never be.  
  
Some things that have been really useful for my little guy:  
Being near, but not touching or looking him in the eye, for casual activities. So we'll sit next to each other on the couch and watch tv, or I'll read my book out loud in a gentle voice. Super non threatening and low pressure companionship.  
Licky mats. He licks a lot to soothe himself, so I got a few of those silicone mats with nubbins, spread a little meat baby food on them, and keep them in the freezer. Low calorie and he'll focus on those instead of licking himself too much.  
Sitting outside on our stoop to expose him to people who pass by. We're several feet away from the sidewalk so no one's coming very close, but it's close enough for him to get scared. Just sit with him, say a bunch of gentle reassuring things, and have training treats handy for when he lets someone walk by without getting reactive.  
  
Basically you're in really early days here. It will take a few months before Erwin really has confidence built up in his new home. Probably another week at least before he even knows where he is. Just make sure he's getting out to use the bathroom, has food and water available, a nice soft quiet space where he can have privacy, and then just wait. Soon enough he'll figure out that he's safe enough to start showing some personality, and then you can work together to build your new life.  
  
He's very cute. Congratulations :)",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/pczx3s/this_is_erwin_its_my_first_time_adopting_an/#hamrmhd,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Congratulations! Thank you for adopting a pup with some baggage to overcome. You are going to make a huge difference in his life!

I’ve fostered a few dogs from hoarding situations or with other fear/anxiety/socialization issues, so I’ve been there. Definitely happy to share resources to help.

I would recommend getting this book (the ebook is fine) about dog body language. Especially with fearful/under-socialized/nervous dogs, it is *critical* that we understand their more subtle body cues, so that we can keep them from getting completely shut down or overwhelmed. By being skilled at understanding what our dogs are communicating to us, we show them that they can trust us to listen to them and that it’s worth trying to communicate with us. By respecting their boundaries when we try to do something with them and they tell us they are uncomfortable or nervous, we show them that they can trust us and that we aren’t going to force them to do things that they aren’t ready for or that are scary. When we build this trust, they start to look to us to determine if something is scary or not (instead of always assuming it is) and will feel comfortable trying new experiences or entering new situations, because they know we’ve got their back and will get them out of the situation if they tell us they are uncomfortable (whether that’s a scary intersection, meeting a stranger, or something else).

It’s a small book of illustrations - not a textbook, and very easy to understand. The illustrator, Lili Chin, is brilliant and has published many free illustrations of animal body language and behavior.

And lastly, vet and grooming experiences can be absolutely traumatizing for fearful dogs. Set your pup up for success by finding a certified fear-free vet if you can, and using Cooperative Care animal husbandry training to desensitize him to things like nail trims and the elements of veterinary exams.

,"I actually just adopted a dog from a hoarding case a few months ago! Biggest things that helped were my dog (she’s reactive to other dogs though, but the slow introduction to him helped a lot), two week shut down, and counter conditioning. 

The first day she didn’t leave her crate the whole time. We put a pen around her crate with puppy pads because the leash scared her so much. We mostly left her alone (I know this is hard) but every time we walked by her pen we threw chicken into it.  We didn’t make eye contact, just did a quick toss and walked by. She’d sneak out of her crate when we weren’t in the room to get the chicken, until eventually she would wait outside of her crate for us. This was a HUGE deal to see her not cower in her crate all day. Then we threw chicken as we slowly approached the pen until eventually we could walk right up to the pen and she’d be excited. 

I also WFH so I’d work in the room with her and throw chicken once in a while, still not making eye contact until we were sure she wouldn’t run as soon as we glanced at her. Eventually we opened the pen and it got to a point where she was following us around. And then eventually she let us pet her.

If your yard isn't big enough and your dog is too scared to learn you need to decrease the threshold. Find a park or something similar where you can increase the distance thereby reducing the noise and sight thresholds. As your dog begins to calm down move closer and closer to the road. I did the same thing for my dog and joggers. 

Finally, if the fear is still too intense you can start with a noise app like www.trainaway.biz They've got car/truck noises.

However I think it will be important to avoid busy streets for now, because you don’t want the fear to get stronger and more internalized.

You can even start with your own car. Have it stop while you and dog are about 20-30 yard away. And then phone with a second person that can drive the car and can slowly start it. You treat for the noise. Then slowly roll and you treat. 

Be careful watching your dogs body language, once avoidance or fear kicks in you got to make it a tad easier on him and move him further away or stop the car. Build up slowly.

"At my wits end with my puppys eating habits, need some advice before i go crazy
**UPDATE AT THE END**

The devil in question: [https://imgur.com/fQ61l1q](https://imgur.com/fQ61l1q)

For the past 3-4 months my 11 month old golden has been driving me absolutely crazy with his eating habits.

He refuses his kibble no matter what, unless we add human food to the top of it. I have been giving him the kibble, then taking it away if he doesnt eat it within 20 minutes (he never does) to try to get him hungry enough to eat. But he holds out for the whole day only to throw up yellow mucus (bile) the next morning.

Yesterday he did it again, refused to eat for all 3 of his meals and threw up bile this morning from an empty stomach. I offered him his breakfast this morning and he refused it still. Im planning to keep him holding out until he doesn't have a choice to eat it

I dont think it's a medical issue because he eats his treats just fine, but will not touch his kibble. He used to eat his kibble no problem when he was 3-6 months.

I have tried changing proteins AND kibble brands. He'll eat it for one meal then refuse to eat it again, the cycle continues. Tried adding warm water to it, same thing. I just dont know what to do anymore.

My main concern is the vomiting. Is it safe for him to hold out on food longer than a day? Anyone have any other suggestions? This is extremely frustrating

**UPDATE: after 2 whole days of no food he is FINALLY hungry enough and started eating his kibble! No toppings, no shenanigans! Thank you all for the help.

,"I know that you don’t think it’s a medical thing but I thought my dog was just a picky eater when she was a puppy and refused to eat her food to the point of throwing up bile. She would eat her treats no problem and would show some interest when I’d add toppers. I tried so so many brands and flavors of food. Turns out, she was allergic to basically every food (and her treats). One of her main allergies is to rice which is in basically all non-prescription food. She would stop eating for many meals because the food made her feel awful when she ate it and I had no idea.

Try doing that, that way the notion of “this is my everyday food I get in a bowl” is gone and he learns this is something he earns (building value).

"People keep letting their unleashed dogs run up to my leashed reactive dog. Need of Advice
My dog is a deaf pit mix who used to be amazing with everyone and thing until she was bit by another dog. Now if another dog gets within touching distance while she is leashed, she loses it. She hasn't bitten, but it's definitely a concern. Normally it's easy enough to manage. We just don't say hi to dogs on walks now or I ask her to sit and stay while other dogs walk by, rewarding her when she does a good job. 

Lately I've had a problem with a lot of people letting their dogs run up to her, both leashed and off leash. My dog looks very friendly, her ears perk and her tail wags. She will even try to walk up to them. But she's unpredictable and it's not safe for anyone involved. I have found I have to be very stern with people to pull their dogs back. They will ask if it's ok to say hi as they are letting their dog get very close. It's really frustrating when I have to be rude and forceful for them to listen. I don't want to yank my dog back because I don't want her to react to my tension.  I try to give her a foot slack leash so she doesn't feel me restraining her. Is that a bad practice?

This morning was a tipping point. We were in our front lawn for her to go potty and a little dog came running up from the parking lot. The owner was calling the dog but it wasn't listening. I tried to slacken the line and get my dog to look  at me. But she's deaf and had her eyes set on this furry little intruder. My dog completely pinned the other dog and was losing it. I had to yank her off by her collar. The guy got his dog like nothing happened and went inside. Didnt say sorry or ask if they were ok. 

What can I do to send a clearer message to people to stay away? Should I be pre-emptively grabbing my dog by her collar? Is teaching her to sit and stay not a good strategy?  I'm mostly concerned about what I should do to avoid reinforcing the reactivity. Im afraid that if I start yelling at people or grabbing her anytime a dog comes near that I will be teaching her that she's right to be afraid and that mom's freaking out too. Should I get a muzzle just so people know to stay away? I don't want to have to muzzle my dog, she hasn't bitten anyone and she doesn't chase at other dogs. It's just if they enter her bubble while she is leashed. I think she feels like she can't get away. 

Mostly I'm super frustrated. I can't even take my dog out to go to the bathroom without having to be vigilant. I feel powerless to stop it and I'm concerned that it will end in my dog seriously harming someone elses and her life being put at risk because of it.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/139vd10/people_keep_letting_their_unleashed_dogs_run_up/,,,,,,,,,,,,

If an off leash dog approaches my leashed dogs, I yell NOOOOO and threateningly stomp at them. 9 times out of 10, they will immediately back off. I then also call the owners to grab their dog. Let them think I'm overreacting. I'd rather overreact myself than have my dog have to react.

I used to be more passive, but that's when my dog then decided he needed to be more proactive in warning off other dogs. Now, I'm the one who chases the unknown dogs away, which means my dog doesn't feel like he has to react as strongly.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/139vd10/people_keep_letting_their_unleashed_dogs_run_up/#jj521rw,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Honestly muzzles aren’t punishment, they are safety gear. I know they have a stigma, but they are a important tool to have in a doggy toolbox. And it sounds like it’s time for a muzzle, you can’t stop other dogs running up while you’re focused on controlling yours. It just keeps everyone safe in those situations. It might encourage people to ask before running up to you as a bonus. 

Training your dog to wear a muzzle can be fun for the dog, they get to a point where they get excited to see it. A high value treat like hotdog slices or shredded chicken breast work great for training your dog to wear a muzzle. The first few days you just drop treats in the muzzle and have your dog slip their nose in to eat the treats. Eventually you can get them to the point where they are happy to keep their nose in for a moment. Then you work your way up to actually attaching the straps. Make sure to reward with lots of treats and viola! Your dog learned muzzles are fun. 

And muzzles are literal life savers for vet visits, especially if your dog is ever hurt or scared when you take them in (god forbid this ever happens). The sweetest dogs can snap when injured or scared. It’s in their nature. 

It also will allow you to drop your guard on walks which could help your dog stay calm around other dogs and actually ease them into socialization and play instead of being reactive. If you have to shout at every owner who lets your dog run up to you on walks it’s going to be really hard to train your dog to not be reactive. 

I’d recommend a muzzle, they aren’t just for dogs who bite, they are for safety.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/139vd10/people_keep_letting_their_unleashed_dogs_run_up/#jj4h18c,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"As others have already said: a muzzle is a clear sign to other dog owners to keep their dogs away from yours. Don't worry about ""labeling"" your dog negatively, be concerned with her safety and the safety of other dogs. This only works when other owners see your dog with enough time to call their dogs back, but it's something at least. I'd also experiment with taking her for walks at non-peak times to avoid interactions all together. Our dog wants to greet every person and animal that she sees while on a walk which can be stressful even though she's not aggressive. It's worth it for us to get up really early if it means a peaceful walk instead of a struggle to keep her from. getting over stimulated.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/139vd10/people_keep_letting_their_unleashed_dogs_run_up/#jj4o9gp,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It will never stop. My dog doesnt socolize well. I live in an area where people walk their dogs off leash more often than not. We run or walk 4-6 miles every day and see dozens of dogs every time. 95% of them don't approach or the owner calls them back if they do. 

5% are fucking annoying. My dog will lift up her lip and show teeth if a dog approaches fast which normally results in the other dog being even more aggressive and has resulted in my dog being bit before. 

What we do now to prevent this... I cough loudly if we are coming up behind an owner who hasnt seemed to notice us yet. This helps a lot because a lot of people who know their dog is agressive will grab them if they notice us. Just a lot of owners dont unless you are loud. 

If their dog is approaching I'll say, ""Shes not friendly"" which again helps a lot. A lot of people let their dog run up because its friendly and assume your dog will be to. This works most of the time because people dont want their own dog to get hurt. 

If that doesnt work or they cant recall their dog then I hold my dogs leash close and step between my dog and the other approaching dog and say, ""NO"" to the other dog. This helps a lot because if you are loud you override most dogs lets go have a fun sniff instinct and they realize oh maybe we shouldnt do this. 

And if that fails and I'll repeat saying NO loudly which normally gets the owner more involved and I either stop fully and keep positioning myself between my dog and the approaching dog or if there are multiple dogs I just keep walking forward to try to get away from them.

It's not perfect but it prevents bad situations most of the time. 

I don't say anything to the owners anymore. I glare now. In the past I've said something like control your dog or mentioned the leash law or something. But I've found all that does is make the person mad and I've never seen someone using a leash later who wasnt using one when their dog sprinted at me. They just dont care. 

It's super frustrating and it really sucks because of other people it can be hard to enjoy walks/runs and you feel like you have to always be on guard. But hopefully that helps.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/139vd10/people_keep_letting_their_unleashed_dogs_run_up/#jj3yxta,,,,,,,,,,,,

No command attached, don’t make her do anything.

,"**1) Build up to the park with progressions. Use progressively more distracting situations.** Start with your backyard, a more empty park on a long 50ish foot lead, the same park on a busier day, a more distracting park at the emptiest time... You can also make your house more distracting (louder music, visitors human and canine, visitors who are talking/laughing/shouting/screaming/dancing). I'd also start practicing recall on walks (bring treats and reward each time), perhaps on a longer lead where appropriate.

**2) Reward, the majority of the time in** ***all*** **contexts, recall.** That sounds obvious, but most people only call their dogs when they're leaving. Unless recall's already rock solid, they'll learn to associate a 'recall' with ""fun is over"" or whatever unpleasant situation you're calling him into. It's also tempting to use recall when your dog refuses to get into the bathtub, get his nails clipped, etc--don't, it's a short-term gain at a long-term cost, especially right now. If you're using your dog's name for recall, also be careful not to desensitize him to it or teach him to ignore it by talking about him, via his name, with others.

**3) Be more enticing when you call his name.** Run away as you call him (might trigger his 'chase' drive and makes you more fun). Have smellier / higher value treats or toys when you call him. Get a little closer before you call him. Pounce on the ground and run and whatever else excites and entices him when you call him.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/qc1b8x/my_1_yo_golden_never_comes_to_me_when_i_call_his/#hhdk5yr,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I would add to these comments to start with a long, like 30ft leash outside once you're ready for that step, and in a low-distractions environment of course. Just so they don't have the opportunity to run off or ignore you and thus rewarding themselves. Either by holding the line and preventing them from going any further until they've come back to you, or by gently reeling them in once you called them. 

Also use very high value treats, like dried lung or other dried treats or hotdogs or cheese whatever works really (I know a dog that would do anything for a piece of plain waffle), and what I've been told is to find one that your pup really loves and only use that for recall.

,"Coming to you should always be The Best Thing Ever.  While that may involve treats or toys, throwing a party is important (you can throw a party even if you don't have treats or toys on me).  Dogs love a good party and throwing one is a great way to have them think you are the best thing out there.  Think about it from the dog's perspective.  If you just call them and then they get a treat or play with a toy, they're likely thinking, eh, I get that home; these odors, other dogs, etc are more interesting.  If you throw a party and are exciting, then the dog wants to see what the all the hubbub is about and will run to you.  Once you have a solid recall and you can vary the intesity of party based on the distraction level.  Even at home in the yard, always throw at least a low intensity party for an instant recall to keep it strong.   Most importantly, never ever call your dog to you and then scold or punish them in any way.  That is single quickest way to poison your recall.  If you need to scold or punish the dog for something, go to where they are and do it.

Edit to add: Know the relative value to the dog of your rewards in different situations. What may be high value at home won't necessarily be high value or of any value in a distracting environment.  For rewards that are high value in highly distracting environments, reserve those rewards only for the highly distracting environments.  This selective withholding will then likely increase the value of that reward.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/qc1b8x/my_1_yo_golden_never_comes_to_me_when_i_call_his/#hhdkoar,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tough to read. Bulldogs are a bit harder to read especially if one isn’t familiar with them. 

But it looks like a mixture of concern, anxiousness and stubbornness. Now what he is trying to say with that I don’t know. 
It is interesting that he tries to maintain eye contact as much as possible. Has he always been this focused on your face? 

At first he seems more anxious looking up to you and your face. As you move away he seems to get annoyed that you are moving. As you then switch directions and go towards the bathroom he gets very anxious and wants to follow. 

Maybe something temporary happened idk he had an off day and nipped you and then you were mad at him and that made him anxious. Some dogs can be very sensitive and you walk around him like he is a bad dog maybe that makes him act that way. Like a feedback loop? Also, go get a physical.

Idk how does he act if you shower him with affection???
I don’t see anything that actually triggers the bite, at first I thought it’s because you went ahead of him but you kind of we’re already ahead of him.

,"Edit: These responses are so helpful! I thought some more information and context might help. 

We adopted Harley at the end of August from a rescue. He was a ""stray"" who had been found heart worm positive a few months prior, and was being fostered by a woman who was fostering 5 other dogs and had 2 kids while he underwent treatment. We picked him up a week before his final shots. He was on a few different drugs for treatment, the main one being prednisone. 

We didn't see any of this behavior until he had been with us for about a month, and it's also worth noting that in the months the foster had with him, she also didn't see any of this behavior. The behavior only started when he was weaned OFF prednisone, which rules out prednisone-related aggression, but also introduces the idea that perhaps the steroids were masking the pain. 

Harley is very bonded to me, as I work from home and am his primary caretaker, but he was previously very loving with Seth and would sit with him, snuggle, etc. In an effort to help Harley bond more with Seth, Seth began hand-feeding him at random. We wondered if maybe that had an adverse effect, with Harley now escalating his behavior to get what he wants from Seth because he was used to having it essentially all the time. It started with some low growls, staring, hackles up, whale eye, body blocking like you see in this video, and then biting. Now it just goes to biting, which is why you see Seth walking cautiously and anticipating it. Perhaps it is a cyclical thing where they are feeding off one another's energy. 

This started about 6 weeks ago and we have been to the vet a few times (no UTI, full blood work came back normal, he certainly is blind in his right eye but that is not a new development, he got an allergy shot, physical check for pain, etc.) with nothing obvious found. Trainers and behavior consultant (she is IBAAC certified) are at a loss. 

It only happens with Seth, no one else—not familiar people, not strange people, not just men, not dogs. He is not reactive generally. The even more confusing thing is that I went out of town last week and he went back to stay with his foster, and he came back completely normal for 5-6 days before this behavior started again. It made me wonder if perhaps he's used to far more stimulation and if our quiet home (even with walks, enrichment, lots of pets) isn't giving him what he needs? He did start fluoxetine 3.5 weeks ago. 

The behavior has happened at various times of day. It switched off suddenly and then came back suddenly and we are just so confused but very appreciative of all the help and suggestions so far!",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/yy9zyt/aggression_or_play_senior_bulldog_has_been_acting/#iwumkcj,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"This type of rough house play is typical for cats and puppies. It looks like they have similar play styles! That said, I wouldn't want this to happen for more than a few seconds at a time - it's great to see they naturally take a pause in the middle of play (both lying down) - but you can see at the end the cat did not like puppy laying on top like that. I think the tail is fluffed up? That plus the stance at the end indicates the pup went a bit too far for the cat's comfort.

Do monitor their play carefully. Dogs aren't able to read cat's 'keep away' signals in the same way that they can read other dogs' body language. And labs are notoriously poor at hearing 'not now, go away' signals.

Be quick to step in and interrupt play if you see them playing intensely for more than 15 seconds without natural pauses, or if you sense that the intensity / arousal is escalating. Use this as a time to proof your puppy's recall (practice this without the cat around too) - It'll be good practice for the dog park etc! But if the puppy can't hear you when playing with kitty, which is quite likely at this early age, err on the side of safety: step in and pick up the cat, or lure the puppy away with a piece of chicken at the nose. Avoid making separations a 'bad' experience.

In addition, assume that things might get more hectic. The puppy's play style and strength / size will change considerably. The cat might get fed up of young, bouncy puppy and stop enjoying playtime. Etc.

During this period of rapid change (puppy growing up and both still learning to live with each other) Don't let them have access to each other except when you're there and actively supervising.

Not that they don't also fight standing up but the on their back move is intended for flaying the underbelly of an opponent. Play fighting tends to mimic what they will do in an actual fight.

 It is all about the body language and intensity. This situation is about as gentle as play fighting gets with animals. It is fine.

,"My cat and dog have played like that ever since my dog was a puppy. We did have to implement some rules though:

Cat initiates play ONLY. He does this by approaching my dog and when she responds he rolls over and waves his paws in the air like 'come at me bro'. We had to implement this rule, as the dog was getting over-excited and bugging him every time he walked anywhere.

Play sessions are ended if the dog pins the cat down/stops him from being able to move away. So we have to supervise carefully.

Play is not allowed in the vicinity of the cat's basket. This is his 'safe zone' and if he is in his basket he must be left alone.

All of this was really important because we figured out my cat is wayyyyy to patient and sweet. He never hisses/ uses his claws or teeth with meaning. That said they are very close and often cuddle together so I think play has definitely helped them bond.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/o81k2g/is_the_cat_playing_sorry_i_know_this_isnt_dog/#h339t7c,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I hope the audio went through.  This is Ellie, she’s a sixish month old rescue potcake. Was found wandering the side of the road so we have no background info on her.  She’s a pretty smart pup, her foster home had her house broken in like a week which blew everyone’s mind. She does this snapping high pitched bark thing when she wants attention or to play. Mainly to me but occasionally to other people. She’s only aggressive if you try to move her while she’s asleep which is probably a product of being on the streets. And she really only growled the first month, she snapped the first few days and then once she was fully awake she got upset like she thought she was bad and I was mad. I never was because it just seemed logical to me being a street dog. She now doesn’t snap and barely growls will just open an eye and see whats being asked of her.  Only providing all this to show she isn’t aggressive in other ways. 

I’ve never seen a dog do this specific action before.  She will also occasionally just snap at the air without whining.  I haven’t scolded her on it because I’m not sure if I should, the first time she did it I was so confused. And since she doesn’t really bite past the excited puppy play with me nipping I’m at a loss.

Since Wednesday we’ve calmed down in regards to the lengths and frequency of walks since I received a bunch of feedback advising it. I’ve always been very vocal in assuring and loving her but I’ve increased that, telling her that she is such a good girl, i love you, you’re so pretty, etc. 

I received tons of good advice, and I’m still looking into them. During the walk through this familiar route we passed a ton of people. I let her smell all the smells as usual. no problems, she is usually very easy on walks.  Still, I’m curious as to what this body language displays. Overall, she seems comfy with me.

,"To me she seems to be gathering information and observant, doesn’t look stressed but she does look alert. She’s fairly relaxed, don’t think she is anxious or nervous. It’s pretty normal for some breed-types to be more alert, skeptical, on guard, etc. especially if they have a high prey drive & I saw you mentioned chickens haha. 

At the moments where she kind of goes still & stares in a certain direction for a second or two, her mouth closes, breathing may pause for a second, muscles in mouth and body may tense up slightly, & her ears may perk forward: That’s when something is peaking her interest & she feels a little bit more tense, uncertain, alert or curious about/ focused on something specific. 

If you are trying to work on reactivity or high prey drive and just want to be aware or observant of her and the environment, those moments are when I personally would perk up and just kinda check out what she’s looking at in case it’s another animal that could escalate into anxiety/ reactivity. But these signs are pretty low on the ladder, she’s still fairly relaxed. But if it escalates: she stares longer, her body and face are more tense, she starts leaning forward, etc. that’s when I would try to get her attention & maybe distract for a second with a treat or something fun. 

She goes back to lightly panting pretty quickly though so it doesn’t seem like she feels threatened & she’s not intensely focusing on anything. When she started walking she just seemed interested in gathering more information about her surroundings, her tail looks to be in a neutral position & she was sniffing away.

,"Body language wise, she is showing relaxation and observing her surroundings:  
Sitting in a relaxed position   
Head looking around slowly scanning the horizon   
Mouth is open and relaxed  
Eyes are soft with no fixed gaze  
Ears in a relaxed position, swerving around to capture sound  
Getting up to sniff is calming and relaxed behaviour   
Coming back with head low and wags shows happiness and openess to interract with you

She is vigilant even though she is relaxed but you could chuck that down to her genetics. I suspect her to be part guardian or basal breeds like a sharpei or chow thanks to that broad nose with a bump. It's instinctual for these breeds of dogs to be vigilant and always be scanning their surroundings as it's one of their breeds primary function and is completely normal and expected behaviour. Do you know what breed(s) she is? 

at 1:17 you can see that her gaze becomes fixed on something, body becomes still, mouth closed and ears erect. That's when her interest was peaked by something. Her body language is more tense in that moment but she quickly bounces back to relaxed within a few seconds. 

If your dog is reactive, her behaviour at 1:17 are the first signs your dog will display if they spot a trigger. This is the best time to distract and disengage your dog to the trigger as it's only the first step in their reactivity displays. Disengaging early can really help descalate behaviour, as you can see that she does that herself in the video. I would praise in that moment to let her know that disengaging and relaxing is what we are supposed to do.

It this past June my wife and I had our first little girl. Bear was very mildly curious out her and has always kind of ignored her. Now that she’s 11 months she motors around on her hands and knees like crazy and of course loves to chase the dog around. Unfortunately he is not a fan if it. He seems to tolerate her interacting with him for a very short period of time and then usually gets up and walks away. But lately he’s been getting seemingly aggressive growling at her, showing his teeth, and the other day actually snapt at her.(did not bit just like a warning) we’re worried that he’s going to actually bite her one of these days and don’t know what to do about the situation. Is this something we can work with him to calm him down? Seems a lot like an only child syndrome/ jealousy thing going on with him. Any advice would be be greatly appreciated, thanks!",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1462pgg/our_dogs_behavior_towards_our_11_month_old/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"All of this is quite normal. Baby antagonizing dog, dog communicating “please stop” by walking away. That doesn’t work, so dog thinks maybe I’ll growl, since baby isn’t getting the message. Baby keeps antagonizing, dog thinks ok, guess I need to bite because this baby isn’t getting it. Dogs are brilliant communicators, and what you shared actually shows that Bear has healthy communication skills and had taken all the steps to communicate to baby “please stop”. Obviously, baby will not understand this. So it’s your job as parents to do it for your baby. If the dog walks away, the first and most gentle indicator of “I don’t like this”, do not let there be a second time. Don’t let it get to the growling stage of communication. I know it’s a juggling act with toddlers and dogs, but for the well-being of everyone in the house, you gotta keep some separation between the two otherwise, Bear will eventually bite baby.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1462pgg/our_dogs_behavior_towards_our_11_month_old/#jnot6pd,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Most dogs wouldn’t be a fan of it. Keep your child away from your dog until she is old enough/learns to not bother him. What he’s doing is escalating - since growling (his first warning) didn’t remove the threat he has moved on to snapping. It was your job to intervene before it came to snapping, in case that wasn’t clear. Your dog is asking for space in the only way they know how, since leaving the situation did nothing he started growling, and now he’s snapped at her. For the record, this is a common issue and if you do any kind of searching on Reddit you’d find a ton of posts like this with lots of advice.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1462pgg/our_dogs_behavior_towards_our_11_month_old/#jno2150,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"It's very simple. Don't let the toddler chase the dog. Creatures don't like feeling like prey. Also, dogs are not programmed to handle a toddler by default. Any trainer would tell you that you are in the wrong, not the dog. It is your job to keep both of your babies safe and comfortable. If either of them feels otherwise it's you who has to change. 

Unless you want your dog to forever be scared of your daughter and other children, you need to start setting boundaries with your kid. Yes, despite her being a toddler.

Also, ""only child syndrome""? This is a dog. If anything he can tell his needs no longer matter and is reacting to that. Belittling his emotions like this isn't going to help you understand him. Altogether that's not an okay thing to pin on someone.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1462pgg/our_dogs_behavior_towards_our_11_month_old/#jnok1y3,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"This is a management situation not a training situation.  Put up baby gates so baby can wander without getting in dogs way. Keep dog and baby separate unless you are able to give direct supervision.

But this is 100%  management so both dog and baby are safe and comfortable",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1462pgg/our_dogs_behavior_towards_our_11_month_old/#jnons6h,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"He isn’t jealous of your kid. He is uncomfortable with her being all in his space and following him around. He tried being polite by backing up and leaving the area, he escalated to growling when walking away wasn’t being respected, but that isn’t working either so moved to air snaps. 

Your dog is actually being really good at sending appropriate signals that he is not comfortable. As the owners and parents of the child you have to figure out a way to advocate for your dog and give him space, since your child is too young to have the cognitive understanding of their choices and consequences. 

Things like baby gates to give each other space. When baby is on floor exploring dog gets access to other parts of the house, when dog is free roaming certain areas baby is in a play pen or down for a nap in another room. All interactions with dog and baby need to be supervised and baby always needs to be redirected from dog when overly interested, dog always needs a space that is his own that baby can’t access easily like a crate, a bed in an high up area, a room divided by a baby gate. This spot should also be reinforcing and positive for the dog so they want to default to it.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1462pgg/our_dogs_behavior_towards_our_11_month_old/#jnp7u8o,,,,,,,,,,,,

Might want to put  crate behind a baby gate at first though and when your dog gets up to get away direct him to his safe place.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1462pgg/our_dogs_behavior_towards_our_11_month_old/#jnoe6wr,,,,,,,,,,,,
"14 week old nipping at faces
Okay, so we got a puppy right when puppies start teething. Before this she was with her littermates so she’s been playing with other puppies and not kids. As seen in the video, she goes for my kid’s faces. She also does it with my husband if he’s laying on the couch and his face is in easy reach. I want to make sure this is a puppy thing and she’s not actually being aggressive. 

She doesn’t do it with me, and I am the one who’s been sleeping next to her crate at night and doing feedings and training etc so she’s mostly attached to me at this point.

What are we doing to entice this behavior? I know puppies play bite and she’s used to playing with other dogs and not people. How can we start training her to know this is not appropriate? So far if she gets too bitey we put her in crate time out for a minute or so. I’m mainly concerned about the face biting though. We are getting her signed up for puppy classes too.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hy625x/14_week_old_nipping_at_faces/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"My young dog didn't bite at faces, but he did bite hard enough to leave bruises. So I'll share what worked for us. His main motivations for the biting were play and frustration. If he put his teeth on us at all, all interaction stopped. If we were playing, interaction stopped. He was promptly ignored. If he calmed down and started playing appropriately, then we would continue the play. That worked for us.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hy625x/14_week_old_nipping_at_faces/#m6fmnbd,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Immediately stop playing with her as soon as she gets bitey. Stand up and cross your arms, totally ignore her until she calms down. If she doesn’t calm down, leave the room for 30 seconds and shut the door before coming back and letting her try again. Usually when you come back, puppies will get pissed about it and will jump at you and try it again, keep repeating until she gets the point. 

Edit since I can’t reply anymore: to the person who said their dog just bites harder, go straight to the leaving for 30 seconds and shutting the door thing. Keep repeating this until the dog stops.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hy625x/14_week_old_nipping_at_faces/#m6fzw0z,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It's fairly common at that age. I got mine at 12 weeks & she liked to go for my chin. I found she did it most when she was overstimulated. She's 10 months now & will bite down on my coffee table if she's over excited. If she did nip I would put her right down & say no nibbles & ignore her for a few minutes. If she was still worked up I would do an enforced nap in her crate to allow her to self regulate.

I will say that your dog doesn't look too comfortable with the way your son is holding her in the second part of your video. You need to look for signs of discomfort or anxiety during playtime & teach your son not to ignore those signs. Children should be taught to respect the dog's space & not treat them like a toy.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hy625x/14_week_old_nipping_at_faces/#m6fx9xn,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"If ur doing the training you need to step in and correct her behavior.  this is totally puppy play imo guessing she has working dog in her. No biting or nipping should be acceptable behavior from puppies when you have children in the home.
Crates are not used for timeouts need to replace our negative behavior with positive behavior . And research proper crate training.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hy625x/14_week_old_nipping_at_faces/#m6g11ud,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Absolutely not aggression, just normal puppy playfulness! For whatever reason, she wants to play this way with your kids & husband more than she does with you (which is perfectly normal). Do they roughhouse or engage in more excited play with her?

As far as remedying, I’m sure you’ll get lots of good advice. But here’s a few thoughts:

1) Puppies often get nippy when they need naps. Look into “enforced naps” and try giving your pup some nap / chill time when they’re like this.

2) Try to redirect the biting onto a toy. If it doesn’t work, then have your kids stop engaging with her (get up, walk away). The more she gets to play like this with them, the harder it’ll be to stop.

3) More prevention: When she’s in a bitey mood like this, try not to give her easy access to faces. Encourage her to play with toys on the floor. If she simply won’t stop going for the face, see #1 and 2 above.

4) Puppies do need to bite & roughhouse, so make sure she has appropriate outlets for this. Other dogs, puppy play groups, exciting toys, bones for chewing, time to get the zoomies, etc.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hy625x/14_week_old_nipping_at_faces/#m6fqwzy,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This is clearly playful and not aggressive! Every time she nips at a face, have your kids turn away and completely cease play for a little bit. That’s what we did with my pup and it helped a lot. And then one day (around 5 months) he just grew out of it.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hy625x/14_week_old_nipping_at_faces/#m6fqyzh,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You can practice incorporating calm. I would section off the couch with a play pen/x-pen until she is a little older and has more impulse control and less instinctive biting happening. 

If she isn’t on a sleep schedule for naps it might be good to start introducing a nap protocol. Downtime in a crate or pen, soothing music, dim lights, low stimulation, low traffic area multiple times a day. Lots of puppies are bitey because they are over tired. Pups should be sleeping 18-20+ hours a day. 

You might also want tether her to you  around your son so you can easily redirect. Don’t pull the leash when tethered but allow the leash to be a physical barrier between your kid and the dog. If it isn’t structured play time, any time your dog attempts to run at your kid you need to be exciting, get their attention, ask for something easy they know how to do like sit or touch and then mark and reward. This is teaching your dog an alternative behavior when your son is around. 

Your kid is still pretty young. I would only allow structured play especially with a more bitey dog. No rough housing, no running for the dog to chase them. They can still play games but it should more like tug and trade toys, ask for sit, down, stay then throw a toy to retrieve. Recall with touch or down as the behavior, running should only be mild back pedaling and not full out sprinting. Petting only when the dog is calm. I recommend if you are using toys with a kid it should be a larger set of toys that give a lot of room for a dog to grip without a kids hands being close to the dog’s mouth. Like a long tug toy, long bumper toy, large fabric frisbee, etc…",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hy625x/14_week_old_nipping_at_faces/#m6fo7mk,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Any continued attention after she does it is reinforcement to keep going. So my advice to you and your family is to stop giving her attention as soon as she does this. Tell your kids to turn their backs and ignore her for a few seconds when she does this. You can also couple that with some kind of verbal cue that it isn’t desirable behaviour, things like “no” or “uh uh”, whatever you use as a verbal cue for her to stop other behaviours. 

I’d also highly suggest against using her crate as a punishment/time out otherwise you risk her associating being in the crate as a bad thing.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hy625x/14_week_old_nipping_at_faces/#m6g6abd,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Running out of patience with our rescue. He just destroyed the third couch in 9 months. How do we break this behavior?

,"It's very important for you to take a step back and look at this from your dog's point of view, he doesn't know what these things are besides stuff around him that's fun for his teeth to be on. It's likely the previous owner who chained him up couldn't wrap their head around why their dog was doing this and just dubbed them a bad dog or lost cause. Not true! 

To stop this behavior you need to spend some one-on-one time to teach him what is okay to chew and what isn't. Teach him how to ""leave it"" and start with treats in your hand. Tell him to ""leave it"" in a cheery/happy tone, and have a treat in your open palm. If he tries to take it close your palm and don't let him have it. When he backs away open your palm again and repeat ""leave it"" in the same cheery tone. If he stays away, praise and reward. 

Repeat this a CRAZY amount of times, until he knows what ""leave it"" means. Now you can start applying this to objects he destroys. When he starts chewing something, walk up to him and tell him to ""leave it"" in the same upbeat tone, and if he stops chewing reward him with praise and a treat. Even if he still has it in his paws, let him know that you liked that he stopped to look up at you.

He should be interested in earning more treats by now, so you can repeat ""leave it"" and move to take the object away from him, and give him an appropriate toy to chew on. He will soon learn which objects will be taken away and which will be given and over time, perhaps many months, he will destroy less as he learns.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/fhgtw0/running_out_of_patience_with_our_rescue_he_just/#fkb19l0,,,,,,,,,,,,

,I have a 9 month old husky. I walk her everyday before I go to work so she’s tired to prevent this. It sucks sometimes walking in the freezing cold at 5:30. But doggo is happy and I’m happy my couch isn’t torn and it’s just kinda become routine. The dog is obviously bored and has too much energy while left unsupervised. If the dogs tired out it’s not gunna have the energy to shred ur couch. I actually walk my dog almost everytime before I leave the house. Not just so my stuff doesn’t get torn up but for the dogs sanity. Think it’s in the crate for 8 hours while your at work and then in there for like 8 hours while your sleeping. More than half the day In the crate so when ur dog gets out of the crate it’s full of energy and been bored all day of course it’s gunna get into something. So you gotta make up for that time while she’s out of the crate tire her tf out. You will both be mich happier. My dog sleeps all day while I’m at work and sleeps in bed with me all night.

"what phrases/behaviors have you “trained” just by sheer repetition?
i’ve had my dogs for 4 years now and i’m definitely a creature of habit, so i feel like they know so many random phrases! some of my favorites:

- any variation of “wanna go…” “let’s go…” “ready to go…” (usually followed by play or outside) —> they get SUPER excited and will also bring me their favorite toy of the day that they wanna play fetch with 
- “gotta wait for mom” is when they ask to go outside (we have the door bells) but i’m in the middle of something —> this gets them to go lay down and chill. 
- similar to above, “let mom have coffee and THEN we’ll go” i say this before i start making coffee, and they again just lay down by me until i’m done with my coffee. i find it interesting that if i say “…and then we’ll go” they don’t get super excited like they would if i said let’s go, wanna go, etc. 
- where’s your ball/ where’s your toy —> they bring me the toy
- give it to mom —> when we’re playing fetch this gets them to hand me the toy instead of just dropping it by my feet 
- let’s get breakfast, let’s get dinner - self explanatory 
- go to your room -->  actually the master bedroom lol. i say this before i start cooking because they hate cooking noises and they know to go hide 
- “wanna jump up?” and pat the spot on the bed, couch etc —> invitation for them to come up

It wasn't desensitizing him to pre-departure cues (despite lots of training trying to fake him out where we desensitize to things like getting keys and shoes). It was making him even more sensitive and superstitious. Without giving him a clear cue that meant ""we're leaving and we'll be back"", he was inventing his own ideas about when we were gonna leave and how long we'd be gone.

"Help with free shaping (no-prop behaviors, body awareness)
My dog and I are new to free shaping, she learned almost everything through luring so far. In free shaping situations, she has a tendency to lie down and stare, she maybe goes through the few things she knows (sits, lies down, lies on her side, crosses her paws in a down, touches my hand with her nose, rests her chin on my leg) but once she ""determines"" it's not one of those, she just defaults to the down-stare. With prop-based behaviors, I had a relatively easy time getting her ""unstuck"", a reset treat usually did the trick and then the first thing she did after is investigate the object, but how do I get started on shaping propless behaviors? Is there a good one to start with, given what she already knows (so maybe not one of those)? How do I get her unstuck? She can hold out her down-stare for minutes without flinching, after which I worry that she might get bored or frustrated if I keep waiting any longer for something to capture or that she would learn that lying down and staring long enough gets me to throw a treat.

I have also heard that it's a good idea to set dogs up with some very basic body awareness skills before starting shaping, because it will make things go easier (I mean very basic things like ""an awareness that they have four paws, all of which can be used in behaviors"", which are often missing for my dog). I know that shaping itself raises this kind of awareness, but does anyone have recommendations on what exercises to do or maybe even what lured tricks to teach as a ""prerequisite"" to shaping?",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1ihsafz/help_with_free_shaping_noprop_behaviors_body/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"""Free shaping"" is an advanced method of ""capturing"".  If you're trying to capture a simple behavior, like getting the dog to lie down when the dog is unwilling to be lured into the down position. You just wait until that natural behavior happens. Mark and reward.  Easy.  

Free shaping is more complicated because you're trying to create a more complicated behavior by capturing parts of the behavior when they happen naturally.  

 So if your dog were to initiate a behavior, you progressively rewarding small steps that get closer to the desired final behavior, essentially letting the dog ""figure out"" the trick on their own by marking and reinforcing any actions that move them towards the goal, without any prompting or lure.   This encourages problem-solving in the dog. 

The catch is that the dog has to initiate parts of the desired behavior * naturally *.  For example if you want to teach your dog to spin around in circles, you would wait until the dog were trying to lie down on its bed and it does the typical turnaround thing before it lies down and you would immediately mark and reward. Dogs are always puzzled the first time. But the next time they start circling in order to lie down, you mark and reward again. Eventually they figure out that that circling behavior is worth something.  

It might help us to know what sort of behavior you're trying to shape?  That way we might be able to suggest when you would be most likely to capture portions of that initiated behavior.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1ihsafz/help_with_free_shaping_noprop_behaviors_body/#mb05tcv,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You need to break it down way smaller. And find approximating behaviours your dog does before she gets frustrated and lays down.

When I free shape ""back up"" for example, I start by heavily reinforcing STAND, which is the required position. Then clicking for everything that indicates the dog is ""thinking backwards"". Ear moving back, eyes flickering, weight shifting. And RAPID FIRE marking+reinforcing those tiny behaviours. Reinforcement rate needs to be high enough so the dog does not get frustrated and starts guessing completely different behaviours that are incompatible with what you're trying to shape.

Additionally the way you deliver reinforcement will make or break the process, so make sure you do it in a way that sets the dog up for succeeding the next repetition.

Either way I really suggest you start your dog getting comfortable with the game ""101 things to do with a box"", if you didn't already, to get her more comfy with taking initiative.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1ihsafz/help_with_free_shaping_noprop_behaviors_body/#mb1px6a,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I’ll copy/paste my comment to someone else.

I had a horrible behaved bull terrier. Barking/lunging at people/dogs.

The biggest thing in my case was just getting her attention on me when I said her name. Here’s how I did it (check my profile and read my post on it if you want) she’s now a perfectly behaved dog after about 3-4 months of consistent work.

“Hey man. Sorry for the late response. I’m definitely no pro, I’ve just been doing stuff that makes sense from YouTube.

I mean, I would look up what professionals have to say on the matter on YouTube, but the best thing for me was to get her to always listen for me and be attentive to my every call.

Call her while she’s eating food, multiple times. Once she masters that, move on to other activities she likes. Fetching is my example. Throw the ball and mid run, recall her. Work on that until she is perfect. If she doesn’t like fetch, get treats and throw them a few feet and immediately recall her until she’s perfect. 

Get her “leave it” command down perfectly. Let her start showing down on food and get her to learn what “leave it” means. Use this is many contexts like with her favorite toys. 

Lastly, once all that is mastered, go for the porch. Just sit out there with her on a leash and let her observe people and dogs walk by. 

At this point she should be listening for your voice so if she starts barking or pulling, call her back to you and make her sit. You can also tell her leave it. 

Once she gets good at this, you can work up to going to the park and sitting off the path a few feet away. You can slowly work closer to the sidewalk once she behaves better. Reward each time she looks at you or listens to you with TONS of praise and treats.

,"For safety, positively train the use of muzzle. Follow the training protocols listed here:
https://muzzleupproject.com/muzzle-training/

More long lasting chews that will allow him to burn energy while chewing. My dogs have loved Beef Cheek Rolls from Chewy and Turbo Tendons from Pupford lately. Long braided bully sticks also keep my dog occupied for a little while.

Invest in Kongs or west paw Toppls and mix his food rations in a wet mixture (research good fillings and test them out on your dog to see if he will eat it) that you can put in the Kongs/Toppls. If he's not sure how to handle a kong, don't freeze it right away and praise him for eating it correctly. Freezing it will make it last longer to get more energy out.

Work on preventative measures. Multiple barriers between him and the outside world at all times. Think about baby gates, extra doors, tie outs, etc. If you have to open the door for a delivery, for example, put the dog away behind another solid door before opening the front door to get the delivery. 

Desensitization training using the sound board on the Pupford app. (Work on triggering sounds and training him not to react... Like the doorbell or knocking). Use your phone and begin with the volume very quiet and play the sound and give a positive ""good!"" and treat him for not reacting negatively. Repeat the process continuing to give him lots of successful practice. 

The Pupford app also gives some basic training tutorials too. 
Check out YouTube for training tools. Make sure you are using training videos that align to your personal belief of the use of aversive training methods. I suggest Pupford and Kikopup on YouTube.

,"Honestly, without money for a trainer this is going to be difficult or nearly impossible. It really sounds like you need a veterinary behaviorist, you can find a [board certified veterinary behaviorist here](https://www.dacvb.org/search/custom.asp?id=4709).

Veterinary behaviorists are specialist veterinarians, they complete veterinary school and then an additional program in veterinary behavior. If there is not a veterinary behaviorist in your area (which is likely) talk to your vet and see if s/he has a consultative relationship with a veterinary behaviorist.

If you thought a trainer was expensive, just wait until you see the cost of a veterinary behaviorist.

I know this isn’t what you wanted to hear, and you don’t have the budget for this, but it is the truth and lying about it won’t do you or him any good. YouTube videos and Reddit forums are not going to be enough to get you through complicated behavior challenges like what you face.

>has a lot of behavioral problems. He is aggressive to strangers, barks like crazy at other animals, and does not listen when he is angry.

This all points to underlying health issues like anxiety which can be partially addressed with medication. Is he “aggressive” or is he reactive? Is he baring teeth, growling, and snarling; or is he barking and lunging? Is this behavior on-leash, off-leash or both? Since you describe “a lot of behavioral problems” directed both at people and animals, both aggression and reactivity are going to be best addressed by a veterinary behaviorist.

How do you know when he is angry? What physical signs (such as body language) is he displaying, and are they directed at a particular person?


>Has the habit of tearing stuff up even when we give him toys. 

What toys do you give him and what is he tearing up?

What does “very active” mean, how much exercise does he get? What is his background (as much as you know)? How is he with basic commands and obedience?",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/pxgjr0/spike_two_year_old_staffy_who_is_very_active_and/#henqfec,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Definitely muzzle on walks. As a pit owner, we're gonna be scrutinized much harder for a reactive pit than others with a reactive lab or reactive small dog. It'll give you peace of mind. Just make sure it's properly fitted and bite proof if possible. Jafco is a great brand for this.

I have a reactive girl pit (75% pit, 25% bull terrier) who is like 85% of the way through her people fear. A lot of it was determining why she was barking at people (her case was fear), then taking a page out of the r/reactivedogs and shoving treats in her mouth to distract her from her fear, teaching check-in commands like ""look at me"". I learned that she copes by chomping hard on a toy and that got her through her people fear at home specifically so now she no longer needs to be muzzled around visitors at home.

We take precautions around kids though, but we recognize the fear signals. She's much better with communicating and trusting me with dealing with it now and we successfully introduced her to our neighbor's kid without fear of a bite. Still working on outside people reactivity, but she's muzzle-trained and it gave me peace of mind when walking her knowing I was going to have more reaction time if she reacts. Helped having another pit who was the opposite and loved people so she started associating more positive reactions because of him being so extroverted.

As for the chewing stuff up issue, I've found it happens when she's bored. She's a garbage diver. She'll attempt to steal food if you turn your back. She'll grab stuff she's not supposed to if it's on the floor. I just try to dog-proof as much as I can, assume she'll be interested in anything (she grabbed an ant trap once) on the floor, and make sure to play with her enough that she won't try to entertain herself by going for the trashcan and making sure that all trashcans have the kid-proof lock. I have gates in the kitchen and entryway and gate-trained her. Again, helped my boy pit was properly housebroken because his good habits rubbed off on her.

I've turned my 8-time returned pit into an almost fully functioning member of society with strictly positive reinforcement and never got a bite incident with her despite her being a big bite risk initially with people.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/pxgjr0/spike_two_year_old_staffy_who_is_very_active_and/#hentigb,,,,,,,,,,,,

2) How much stock do you put into the statement, ""There are no bad dogs, only bad owners""? In other words, how much of aggression do you believe is nature, and how much nurture?

3) How would you describe your personal training methodology?

4) How does a trainer get started in taking aggression cases? Personally, I don't think I'll ever because of physical difficulties i.e. being a very small person, but I am just curious as to how you get ""comfortable"" dealing with dogs that want to eat you.

4) Something a little more grim: do you believe that there is an uptick in behavioral euthanization recommendations in recent years? I've heard in the past that dogs are getting ""worse"" and the baseline for good behavior is dropping. Do you agree with this?

"Rather strange behavior when asking puppy to hop onto bed with us
Okay so this situation is really unusual I think and I don’t know how we “accidentally trained her this” but we have a 5 mo old border collie (female) who, whenever we ask her to come up onto the bed to sleep with us or just lay down she will absolutely freak out at our cat (and if the cat isn’t there she will bark at his cat tree) she will bark, growl, run around, jump frantically at the cat tree whether he is in it or not, all just because we asked her to hop onto the bed. Now I’ve tried using a different word several times like “come here” “up” or even just when I pat the bed to signal her to come up it gets the same reaction. If I even say something in an uppity voice no matter what the word is, same reaction. I find it bizarre and I don’t know how she learned this. I just want her to come up on the bed and sleep with us and I want a way to invite her to do so. She will usually eventually jump up and settle down but always this strange fit comes first. Any advice would be fantastic. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1ioa6lb/rather_strange_behavior_when_asking_puppy_to_hop/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Border collies are highly instinct driven dogs. They feel like they have a job to do, and if they aren't given one then they will make one up in their heads lol. Sounds like some confusion in your pup's mind as the BC instincts are kicking in. 

They are hyper intune with their ""flock"" which in this case sounds like your cat, unless she is given anything else. She might think there is a certain routine at bedtime and when you tell her to get to bed her brain switches to ""work mode"" and is maybe trying to herd your cat to where she feels that it should be. But you aren't giving her any direction so it's just confusing for all.

I highly, highly, recommend working on daily herding work with her (you don't need to do this with animals) so she can do her job and then learn to switch off too. BCs tend to be either in the job or not in the job. You should try to stick to giving commands only during training or games, as if you give her a command at bedtime she will switch into work mode",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1ioa6lb/rather_strange_behavior_when_asking_puppy_to_hop/#mcnmyok,,,,,,,,,,,,

Border Collies are a working breed with strong instincts, so you need to understand what she needs to be happy, rather than trying to change her instinctive behaviour to what you want.

,"If she's still having accidents indoors: 

1.   Management. She needs to be in a crate, or supervised, preferably at the end of a leash with a human on the other end 100% of the time. That way she can't sneak off and find a place to hide and poop. 

2.  When you do take her out make sure that you reward her heavily for going potty outside.  High value treats should go out with you. Make sure you make a big deal about it and tell her how fabulous it is that she went potty outside. Especially if it's a number two. 

3.  Start teaching her a way to alert you that she needs to go. Some dogs won't bark. But they might ring a bell that you hang on a door knob.  

4.  Never ever scold or get upset when there's an accident. If you are managing (see 1) any future accidents become your fault, not the dogs.  Let it go 🎶

5.  Do not free feed.  If she's an only dog and she tends not to finish her meals, do not leave them on the floor for her to finish. Later. After 15 minutes, take the food bowl up off the floor. Add her next meal to it and put it down on the floor for the next meal time.

,"Our adopted mutt had ""dirty dog syndrome"" that was undisclosed from the previous situation she was in. She did the same thing. It seemed to be an anxiety response. If she heard shouting (even happy loud voices) or unexpected loud noises, sirens etc, she'd have inappropriate poos. 


So now when she does it, we use gentle, quiet indoor voices and point to the poos, then say ""outside"" which is our word for going poo outdoors. Then we guide her (not force her) to go outside and give her huge praise and treats. It's slowly getting better.

If you’re not directly supervising (and I’d suggest letting them drag a leash indoors for now) they should be penned or crated.

,"Your family heeler is exhibiting a behavior called ""muzzle punching."" This behavior usually means one of two things: 

1. Increase distance; Go away; Back up; I'm uncomfortable right now
2. Decrease distance; playful; Interact with me; I'm bored

Seeing as how the family heeler is approaching your dog on her own initiative, it's safe to say that she's in the mood for play. 

Your dog, on the other hand, is not accepting the invite. The normal response to this is playful jumping, chasing, etc - but your dog stands perfect still indicating she is uncomfortable and tense.

I would distract the younger dog, maybe play some tug or throw a ball, so your girl can relax. The two of them have different energy levels, so the best way for them to get to know each other is to simply be around one another without any one-on-one play. It's possible that they'll get closer in time, if the other dog can learn to chill and not bug yours to play with her.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/11l1ce3/can_someone_tell_me_what_this_behavior_is_i/#jbc3luf,,,,,,,,,,,,

I agree that your dog looks tense. Has she recently had a vet exam?

It could be other kinds of pain like mouth pain as well. Just because they are eating doesn’t mean they don’t have mouth pain, it takes an extreme mouth issue for a dog to stop eating entirely.

 If this was my puppy I would be happy the older ones are good with littles but I would want my pup to learn how to say they don't want to play if they feel overwhelmed. Some pups charge in when they feel overwhelmed instead of moving away or showing de-escalation signs. As long as their playmate is a good player no one gets hurt but the pup learns that being overwhelmed during social interactions is normal. That CaN lead to someone getting hurt.

"My dog’s bad behavior saved my life.
I know this isn’t really the place to post this but I’m a little shaken up. I figured I might as well post here because he did something that I’ve been trying to train out of him….

At about 5am this morning someone broke into my house. They had a key and just let themselves in. Our two pups are still sleeping in their kennels at night but our oldest is 100% free roam. He woke me up with his big boy barking and bolted out of the bedroom. One of the pups, the one by the door, was also barking. I stupidly ignored it because it was close to time for my husband to get home(he works nights and gets home between 6-7), they often bark when he gets home and if the wind catches the storm door just right, it sounds like it’s opening and they will think that’s him earlier(so this isn’t an uncommon thing, it happens enough for me to expect it every morning almost). When my husband got home he immediately started yelling for me, our oldest had been sitting on the porch…the door was left opened. He chased away who ever it was thankfully, not 100% sure if he chased outside, he’s able to fully work the storm door from either side so once the big door was open he could had gone in and out a few times. But I’ve been trying to get him to stop barking at the door for years. Now I feel like an idiot for trying to get him to stop. He’s super friendly, I don’t think he would have bit anyone, but who ever was trying to come inside didn’t know that. We’re changing the locks today(we moved in a few months ago and our realtor assured us these were all new locks but I never should had trusted that. I just feel so stupid for ignoring their barking, for not changing the locks, and for taking my time getting my two pups ready to fully free roam as well. I’m done trying to stop his door barking. I don’t have people come over often and if I do, me and the dogs are normally outside waiting for them, I feel like I need that little extra security then I need the quiet.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/orcbt8/my_dogs_bad_behavior_saved_my_life/,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I started with teaching her a command when she would just bark during play and such, because it helped with her confidence. She could learn to bark at times other than when she was scared. Then, I started also teaching a leave it/quiet command during those times. Nothing was threatening her, so she learned quickly, especially because treats and praise were involved. Then, when she'd bark at the door, I'd encourage it with the bark command once or twice until I got to the door to check it out, praise her, then follow with the quiet command to let her know that's enough and praise her for that. ""You did good letting me know, thank you, I hear you, but I understand now, so you can stop, we are safe."" It helped her learn to self regulate her fear because I made barking something that was a task rather than a reaction. Yes she still reactively barks some, but she has gotten much better at the quiet command during those times, since I was able to teach that when she wasn't afraid and reactive.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/orcbt8/my_dogs_bad_behavior_saved_my_life/#h6hqh1z,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first few times we did this by physically moving into his space when he was barking at the door while saying ""ok thank you"". So the dog is barking, somebody's on the porch. Walk directly into the front of the dog assertively but gently. You probably won't touch — most dogs will step back and put their attention on you. The trainer taught us this is saying ""ok thanks, I'll take control from here"" in dog language. And after 3 or 4 times of doing this, we can just give the verbal command.

,"I have a rat terrier mix who is 17 now, along with 3 other dogs. She barked at EVERYTHING in her youth. Person outside? Dog outside? Cat outside? Squirrel? Bird too close to the window? Car slowing down as it passes us on a walk? It drove me insane and I tried to train her not too, but she loved barking. Now that she's old she doesn't bark as much, and she doesn't walk with me. Let me tell you, I miss the barking. I miss it so much. She was a fantastic watch dog. She might be small, but just a barking dog draws attention and deters bad actors somewhat (plus when she barks, my others typically follow her lead, they just don't start it). My other dogs will let people sneak up on me. They're the well trained ones. Barking is very useful and it is easy to take it for granted. 

I remember I was outside playing with all my dogs at 1 in the morning (I'd gotten home late and was letting everyone run off some steam before going to bed, mostly my, at the time, 10 month old cattle dog pup). We were running up and down the sidewalk, being dorks, I was throwing a ball when all of a sudden my rat terrier barks. I look up and there is a man across the street (I go out late a LOT, there is NEVER anyone out there). Freaked me out that my other three dogs didn't even notice him. As soon as ONE barked, they all barked and noticed. But the thing about training out reactivity is that if you do it well, the other dogs barely even notice what you don't want them reacting too.

"Vet concerned about 12 week whippet’s behavior
Hi there everyone. I have an almost 12 week old female whippet puppy, who we acquired at 9 weeks. 

She is comfortable in her crate when it is open, and chooses to nap there.  Once the door is shut and I walk away, she will cry, howl, and bark as soon as she realizes she is locked in. At first, I tried Susan Garrett’s crate games (and am still working on them), but she does not seem to improve beyond the moments she knows treats are coming. She will focus on a kong or searching for kibble for a few minutes, but once she finishes, she starts the screaming (it really is screaming.) 

I thought, “maybe she already has separation anxiety” or “she’s just new,” because i have managed to improve her crate aversion to a point where she will let you close the door, but still gets upset when you leave. The more she learns and grows, the worse this issue gets. The more i reinforce being calm, the more she escalates once i walk away. Even if i only go 5 feet. She quiets when she hears walking in her direction, but restarts once she feels you aren't coming. Giving her treats for rare spurts of being quiet, cheering when she goes in the crate at will, tossing treats randomly to give positive association….no. She takes these things as acknowledgement and attention and, even if she was quiet for several minutes prior, restarts the screaming cycle. It can last hours if you let it. 

At her vet visit yesterday, I brought this up among other things that tell me she’s strong-willed and very very smart (mastered sit, stay, come, roll over, spin, among other things by 10 weeks.) I have raised two blue heeler females and NEVER had a puppy this quick or this intentional about their behavior. 

The vet said she agrees and she can tell simply by observing the puppy that she is a thinker, and an incredibly bossy one at that. In fact, she called the puppy ""one of the bossiest she has seen."" She said she “is going to be a tough one, good luck.” And that we should let her scream it out. She is “not anxious, she is pissed about not getting her way.” The vet was not rude, harsh, dismissive, anything negative. She went over what we are currently working on with her behavior, and concluded that pup just needs more strictness, structure, firm discipline.

I typically would be hesitant about this advice…but it really seems true. If the puppy escalates to sounding like she will die of panic if she isn’t helped, and then you pet her to lessen it (I did this the first time. she really sounded like someone was ripping her nails out. wasn't trying to reward her), she does not physically feel anxious at all. No elevated heart rate, no shaking, no crying, no dast breathing, no nothing. Just a happy little puppy who got released from her “cell.” she immediately either returns to normal, or destroys something in retaliation. 

She also does NOT have the whippet ""sensitive"" trait I was told to be mindful of. She is totally chill with a firm tone. When placed with large, dominant dogs (my parent’s dogs. Very kind, but very firm, very large dogs) she gets all over them and tries to run the show. Does not back down.

The vet was also upset that the puppy ""lacks major boundaries."" She jumps on your lap, on the couch, wherever she wants, without permission. She ignores commands once she realizes you are out of treats, etc. 

Should I just let her scream for hours? Is 12 weeks old mature enough to already consider her ""lacking a significant amount of boundaries?” vs still learning? I am at a loss and feel overwhelmed and like I’m failing.

Edit because it seems I have been unclear (??) 
I did not really feel as though she was doing poorly prior to the vet visit. She is frustrating and strong-willed, yes, but I was very much feeling that she is simply young and still learning. I never expected a puppy to act as though she had 10 years of obedience training.",,,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/11hympz/vet_concerned_about_12_week_whippets_behavior/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"12 weeks is still a tiny baby! It sounds like you're doing a really nice job with her. I actually try to rely more on x-pens set up like little puppy playgrounds rather than crates at that age. I think I would also err on the side of interpreting major vocalizations in the crate as distress and not ""lack of boundaries"" or whatever.

I also - just in case this helps you find some success with crate training - reeeeally prefer an approach like Sarah Stremming's ""Happy Crating"" (I think she has some webinars on it for purchase, and maybe a free podcast on Cog Dog Radio) rather than Susan Garrett's crate games, which I think are structured in a way to build a lot of arousal around being crated (vs. Happy Crating, which is intended to condition calm resting associations with the crate).",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/11hympz/vet_concerned_about_12_week_whippets_behavior/#javwqs7,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"She has only been with you for two weeks and is a puppy. You have to give her time to succeed and remember she is still a pup. It takes many dogs much longer than two weeks to master the crate, even more so for a puppy in a new environment with new people.

Of course, she just wants snackies and not to be in the crate. The crate isn't a fun place with humans around to give her attention. Just keep working with her and take it slow, work in increasing in increments.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/11hympz/vet_concerned_about_12_week_whippets_behavior/#javx767,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"""cry it out"" has more recently been tied to increased anxiety because they don't self soothe, they learn they don't feel safe, especially as young as 12 weeks and that the crate isn't to be trusted. 

Unfortunately, many vets may be well versed in health things, but are not up on the latest in behavioral things.  

My vet is great, but actively promotes a local training company that is well known for aversive methods.  I'd NEVER take real training advice from them.  

Plus, 12 weeks old..... Boundaries?! Puppies follow you every time you get up to pee. They are your shadow until they grow a bit more independent.

,"I mean, I don't think anyone should be surprised that a puppy or a dog does not like being locked in a box. The cried out method isn't a good method for people or for dogs - It's correlated with an increase in anxiety and anxious attachment styles because the puppy or baby feels that caregivers won't meet their needs.

Crate training is really hard, and it doesn't really stick for all dogs. There are other ways to keep a puppy safe, like a pen or puppy proofed room. I think you should keep working on it because I think that crates can be a really important tool, but don't be surprised if your dog ends up doing better with a different method of confinement while you are gone.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/11hympz/vet_concerned_about_12_week_whippets_behavior/#jawsgf0,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Puppies cannot be bossy, stubborn, etc. They just don't have the mental capacity, it's impossible. She's either scared alone or has barrier frustration/FOMO. It's perfectly normal at her age. Keep doing what you're doing, lots of crate games, building confidence, and don't let her get scared/frustrated. ""Cry it out"" either causes true separation anxiety or learned helplessness. If you keep up the good work, she'll be confident enough to be alone once she's a bit more mature.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/11hympz/vet_concerned_about_12_week_whippets_behavior/#jaw5txj,,,,,,,,,,,,

After she tore her nail off in an OPEN crate that I didn’t even put her in (she went into it willingly, and then freaked out when I left the room to pee), I switched it up. I put up a baby gate, and made a corner of that small space “hers”, bed and dog blanket. Trained her to “go to your room.” She could walk to the gate to see me, then go back and lie down. Eventually (maybe 2 weeks?), she was totally fine without looking for us. It’s been years now, and that’s her “safe place,” where she goes when the other dog or kid isn’t listening to her and she wants to sulk, or she’s tired or whatever. Bit unconventional, but it works just fine. She also hides her prized toys under her dog bed, so I do a check every now and then. Maybe something like that?",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/11hympz/vet_concerned_about_12_week_whippets_behavior/#javyetl,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Horrendous advice from the vet. Unfortunately most general vets know nothing about canine behavior or mental health. Please don't feel upset or take any of their comments personally or seriously.

A puppy is a baby. They are away from their siblings and mother for the first time. Living with strange new people in a strange new place by themselves. Of course they will be frightened to be alone. They are totally dependent on you and look to you for security and comfort. I think isolating them, or applying strict boundaries, unrealistic expectations and stern discipline on a literal infant will harm your bond and relationship building process.

,"I was given a difficult situation with a livestock guardian dog (LGD) who just kept chasing our animals and terrorizing them. Not listening to us. And repeatedly escaping and going on long walk abouts. 




He was supposed to be a trial of a trained LGD and when we told the lady it wasn't working out after a few weeks, she said she wouldn't take him back and to just take him to the pound. I tried to find a home for him to no avail, so I took him to the pound. 




They said they would most likely have to euthanize him if they didn't find a home for him in a couple weeks and they didn't think that was likely. They already had a bunch of dogs and failed LGDs don't move in their experience.


I left the pound and brought him back with me. Now I'm doing everything I can do to train him to be a house dog and find a good home for him.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1iiev70/dog_guardians_who_have_made_the_difficult/#mb82fbw,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Please help - my dog is having behavioral problems so bad, my trainer doesn’t even know what to do.
Reddit, I am a dog owner in need of some serious help. I’ve tried nearly everything I can to help alleviate some of the problems that I am currently dealing with, and every single solution has turned up nothing. And so, I turn to you, hoping that you might be able to provide an answer. 

I have a two year old male corgi named Basco, who is honestly my favorite thing on this earth. He is kind, and sweet, and gentle (at least with living things), and he’s made my life feel a lot happier. But, he has had some incredibly serious behavioral issues that I cannot seem to find an explanation for. To be honest, I’m certain that somehow, I’m doing something wrong, but for the life of me, I cannot figure out what it is. I’ll go into detail on everything that has happened down below, but any and all advice you all can provide would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!

The issues started roughly 3 months ago. Basco has had some behavioral problems in the past, but they were mostly related to him not following commands outside of carefully controlled environments (despite lots of work with our trainer), and occasionally chewing on things. He also took nearly a year to be properly house trained. He’s an incredibly smart dog (as most corgis are), but he’s also really stubborn, and if he wants to do or to not do something, it’s his way or the highway. We actually had a previous trainer refer us to somebody else, because we went through several months of her classes and nothing about his behavior changed. His potty training has improved, and is down to around 1-2 accidents per week now, but he is still really stubborn, and lately, he has gotten incredibly destructive.

We recently moved to a new city for a new job of mine, and it’s my first job where I actually have to go into work, as I started work during the pandemic. I made a point to give him alone time during this period, so that way when I would eventually stop working from home, he wouldn’t have separation anxiety. When we moved to our new apartment, things started out fairly decent. However, in the past 3 months, he has cost me nearly a thousand dollars in damages, and now has to be confined to a very small part of my tiled kitchen when I am not home.

In the past 3 months he has destroyed: several wires, all of which should not have been in his reach, and I still to this day do not know how he got them, the legs of my coffee table, an entire couch (yes, the whole thing. It was equally impressive and frustrating. I had to throw out the couch. It was that bad), my bike, which I store indoors, a tv stand, and he has chewed his way through the bottom of my trash can, chewed a hole in my wall, and has annihilated my carpet to the point that I have to pay to re-carpet my entire apartment. He has also chewed and bent the electrical heating units along my baseboards in several places. Not sure what they’re properly called, but it’s the white metal bars that run along the wall near the floor in place of heating by ventilation. He also is not allowed to have dog beds, as he destroys them within minutes, and has even bent the bars of his kennel!

At first, I thought he was just confused or anxious about the new environment. So I made a point about slowly introducing him to new parts of my apartment. I know corgis have a lot of energy, so I make a point of working with him daily to get that out. We go to a doggie day care twice a week in the mornings so he can run and play with other dogs, and the other three days of the week, we either go on walks around my neighborhood or play indoors for at least an hour before I leave for work. (For context, I work 1-9pm, Monday-Friday) I also make sure to do several puzzle toys with him before I leave, and I leave him with a frozen kong of treats and two of those snuffle mat things with hidden treats while I’m at work. I also make sure to leave the tv on, either set to one of those 10 hour doggie TV videos or a long YouTube playlist. I also make time every day before I leave for work to practice commands with him, though if I’m being honest, progress in that department has been pretty poor. We also see a trainer on the weekends, and I make a point about following her directions exactly. 

Because of my hours going late, I can’t just leave him at daycare all day, as every daycare within a 50 mile radius of me closes by 6pm, and my hours aren’t really something that I can change due to the nature of my job. The daycare nearest us does allow us to visit for a few hours during the week, (for a fee) which I am highly appreciative of. I’ve also tried using bitter apple sprays as a chew repellant, as well as a vinegar based chew repellant spray that I found online, and neither of these have any effect. I’m honestly convinced my dog doesn’t have taste buds, as neither of these sprays seem to prevent him at all from destroying stuff. Obviously, when I see him engaging in this behavior at home, I make a point of interrupting him, but he doesn’t really seem to learn anything by it, as his behavior there hasn’t changed in the past few months. I also make sure to buy him plenty of new toys to keep his interest, as he pretty much refuses to play with any toy that is more than a week old. 

Honestly, I’m at a total loss here. My trainer is out of ideas, I’m out of ideas, and as a result, it’s gotten to the point where I have to leave my poor Bosco in a pen, in the middle of my tiled kitchen floor, the entire time I’m at work. (To be clear, this is a recent development. I spent most of the past few months letting him roam the apartment and trying to solve the problem without confining him.) I came home today to find that he had somehow torn up a tile from my floor, meaning that I am now going to have to repair that. I honestly don’t even know how this is possible. I love my dog and truly want to give him the best home possible, and I genuinely want to solve this problem, but I have no clue where to start. So, I ask you, Reddit - what am I doing wrong? Am I getting bad advice? Could I be doing more? Any and all help is appreciated.

,"Crate training and see a better trainer. 8h in the crate is too long so if you or someone you know can let him out everyday half way through your shift then that would be better. Also there's no such thing as a stubborn dog, he just has no idea he's doing anything wrong.

As for separation anxiety 3 months is nowhere near long enough to prepare for that, but also I don't think that that's a significant factor in his behaviours if he has it at all. The heart of the problem is that 8h is a long time, and no matter how much work you do outside of that he's gonna be bored, and he's going to find immense enjoyment in destroying things. I mentioned crate training (proper crate training, not just throwing him in one and leaving) because it will prevent access to the things you don't want him to destroy and a properly conditioned crate will put him in an environment he associates with switching off and relaxing. You're trying to make every day so exciting for him but not teaching him how to switch off and just relax.

The other thing you could try is to satisfy that urge with something he's allowed to destroy. You can pick up used stuffed toys online for cheap and allow him to rip and destuff them as an outlet for the boredom.

Honestly this just sounds like a dog that's nowhere near ready to be left alone for that amount of time. 3 months is not a long time in dog training and in that time he's moved home and gone from very little alone time to 8h+ a day. If you really want to keep him I'd be looking for remote jobs, jobs where you can come home mid shift, or shifts that work with daycare opening times.",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ywlv34/please_help_my_dog_is_having_behavioral_problems/#iwkgc3p,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Hi. I’m a professional behavior consultant that specializes in separation anxiety. Not all trainers have the updated protocols on how to resolve separation anxiety. 

It sounds like Basco is having separation anxiety. Which can be really tricky to resolve, especially if suspending absences isn’t an option. 

Was Basco ever crate trained? 

Here are some suggestions:

🐶 Suspend absences: dog day care, pet sitter or friends and family

🐶 Play through the dogs ear on amazon music or Apple play. It’s a psychoacoustical music that is calming

🐶 try calm-a-mile spray, lavender calming spray, and/or adaptil diffuser/collar

🐶 try composure chews or talk to your vet about behavior meds. [Why we use meds a first line of defense.](https://www.drjensdogblog.com/behavior-medication-first-line-therapy-or-last-resort/)

🐶 put a camera in, I like the yi home 360 on amazon. Watch for signs of stress: panting, drooling, spinning, pacing, barking/whining/howling and major destruction 

🐶 get the book: Be Right Back by Julie Naismith 

🐶 hire a certified separation anxiety pro: https://malenademartini.com/, https://www.subthresholdtraining.com/find-a-trainer/",,https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ywlv34/please_help_my_dog_is_having_behavioral_problems/#iwli18x,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Your dog is saying he doesn't like that. He is warning you with sound probably due to his other warning signs being ignored in the past. My dog doesn't like hugs or people leaning over her. If it's sudden and a stranger, she immediately reversed and starts barking. If it's someone she knows, she licks her lips, maybe yawns or pants, and will give the whale eye. She is more likely to yelp and retreat that be confrontational, so she doesn't growl or show her teeth. 
Also, if your dog is having pain, they are responding to the pain and that you are causing the pain. If they were growling while doing something like guarding a toy or food, that would be concerning. The guarding would be the behavior to fix, not the growling specifically.
TL;Dr: your dog is communicating with you that he does not like being touched on his hips because it hurts.

"Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…
We had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We'd take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he'd immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn't see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he'd start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn't really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren't worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)

One year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren't in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We'd try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he'd just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.

Finally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.

A week later, our dog's balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That's when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog's sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His ""sundowners"" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It's absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.

**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog's body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam. 

CCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don't want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.

Here are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:

In summary:

* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.
* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.
* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.
* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.
* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).
* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.
* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.
* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have a 11,5 yo frenchie, who has had 3 back surgeries in his lifetime and double ear canal removal surgery last year. He recently started having pain episodes where he is uncomfortably shaking and panting even after the pain meds. We did take him to a neurologist who has been seeing him since he was 5. They ran a bunch of tests, did mri etc and didn’t really figure out what was the source of pain other than “he is old and it can be anything “.. we have been able to keep him comfortable with 2x CBD oil and about 10 days ago started on gabapentin every 12 hours. At this point we are just trying to spoil, love him and keep him comfortable. After the ear surgery last year (which had very tough recovery) we decided not to put him through any more surgeries and just let him be. Hopefully he will let us know when the time comes.

"Dog with CCD
Hi everyone. I need some advice. Pardon the long post but there's a lot to say. 

So I rescued my staffy, Tilly, at 3 weeks old. I hand-reared her and she's been by my side ever since. We've been through 9 years of life together and have a very strong bond. She's my soul dog. Obviously, you build a strong bond with a dog when you bottle feed them every hour and then help them wean, your basically their mum. Then later in life I lost my dad (I was 21) and it sent my Bipolar into a spiral. She literally saved my life multiple times, like literally, she alerted the neighbours to me being passed out, she pulled me off a window ledge, and so many more things. She's literally lived every trauma, success, everything with me. 

When we moved into our bigger house, now married and with a child, we got a second dog. A boxer pup. She absolutely loved him. She babied him and washed him. They were best friends. 

Earlier this year she was diagnosed with CCD (canine dementia) and her personality started to change. She's always been feisty but she's started attacking our other dog (he's one now) and not even my presence can calm her, like it used to. We've had to keep them separated and its breaking my heart. Luckily we have a big enough house to comfortably do this, but I miss snuggling them both on the sofa and seeing them play. 

She's back at the vets Monday and I'm hoping they can give her something to help with the aggression. Its breaking me to see her so distressed, and to see my boxer boy being hurt. 

What does the road map from here look like? Are we near the end of the road? Do I have a tough decision in my immediate future? ",,https://i.redd.it/gm5j6f3gmiud1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1g2oaxb/dog_with_ccd/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"CCD can be tough but it's manageable.  I had a dog live with it for 2 years, though his symptoms weren’t severe, and he eventually passed from an unrelated issue.  However, our most recent girl had severe CCD symptoms.  She would pace, pant, spin until she fell over, get stuck in corners or under furniture, and bang into walls- it was heartbreaking. The vets often prescribed medications like Gabapentin, Trazodone, and sometimes even Xanax or Prozac, none of which are specifically for CCD.  We only tried Gabapentin and Trazodone, but they caused more harm than good.

There's a common medication now called Selegiline (Anipryl), and some have had success with it, though it can have side effects too.  We were considering euthanasia when we decided to consult a holistic vet.  She recommended and guided us with CBD oil, and it completely stopped our girl’s symptoms.  We were fortunate to have another year together.  When signs of aggression appeared, we separated her from the other dogs, but the CBD mellowed her out, and the aggression was no longer an issue.

It may or may not work for your dog, but consulting a holistic vet is worth considering.  They often have more knowledge on how to manage CCD.  You’re not at the end of the road- you're at the start of what might be a long and difficult journey.  Finding the right combination of supplements (and possibly medications) can make that road easier to navigate.  There is a CCD group on Facebook that has a lot of information and people dealing with it.

,"For the first time since I have joined this sub I am completely at a loss. I have had and Loved Dogs every second of my 46years. I have worked with, trained, fostered, and rescued them for 28 years. 

I have been there for dozens of Rainbow Bridge crossings and have wept every time. The last one was my Soul Doggie and it caused me physical pain when she crossed. 

For 14years she slept right above my head on the same pillow and I cried myself to sleep for 6months because I couldn’t get to sleep without twirling her hair and feeling her lil yorkie peets resting on my head. 

After a little over a year and I was finally able to start falling asleep on my own, and I will swear this on my soul. I felt my 4.5lb Yorkie Gypsy’s weight shift the pillow and her lil peets resting on my head. 

It doesn’t happen often, or I don’t pay close enough attention, but when it does I am reminded that there is no Love on Earth stronger than true Unconditional Love and nobody does it better than our Puppy Dog babies! 

Tbh I don’t know if I could deal with the pain you are experiencing I truly don’t. What I do know and believe with my entire being, is that as Faithful and Loyal as our Fur babies are in life, so too is their spirit when they pass. Until the far off day when it’s your turn to cross over, you will have at least two of the happiest babies ever to greet you!

"16 year old Tibetan Spaniel’s CCD is getting really bad

My 16 year old Coco is starting to struggle. It’s 5am and she’s been pacing since 10pm, getting stuck and barking, and can’t find relief even with the lights and tv on. I have tried gabapentin and melatonin but that doesn’t slow her down at all. It almost energizes her. 

She has IVDD so has mobility issues and can walk but I have to use a special leash to hold most of her back weight up for her. She doesn’t play or wag her tail anymore. I can’t rest for more than 4 hours at a time, even during the day. She doesn’t like to be pet or held. She engages with other dogs by sniffing and will let others scratch her head but that’s about it.

She eats some but doesn’t really care for treats unless it’s my food. She won’t let me brush her, and it’s a fight to bathe her. I had to get a mobile vet because she is even worst in car rides. Her teeth aren’t great and she’s too old for a dental, her liver/kidney blood work shows that’s starting to decline. 

The QOL scale isn’t capturing the reality of what’s happening, she got a 33. We are basically existing at this point because I can’t leave her with anyone and I can’t leave her alone for too long. Which means I also don’t have a life. I don’t want her to suffer but don’t know what else to do but consider it’s time to let her rest. It doesn’t seem right to let her exist with only small bouts of relief when she does sleep. Making a vet appointment to discuss more. Just writing it kind of lets me know. 💔",,https://i.redd.it/5avu4bpl7cde1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1i2mfkl/16_year_old_tibetan_spaniels_ccd_is_getting/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Coco looks so sweet. For my girl’s CCD, a holistic vet guided us with CBD oil, which stopped all of those symptoms. She also had either IVDD or a neurological issue—they could never positively diagnose—and one day she lost the ability to get up and walk. We were ready to say goodbye, but our traditional vet suggested trying Prednisone first. It ended up working for the last six months she was with us. I don’t know if a combination like that could help your girl, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

It’s clear how much you love Coco and how much care you’ve given her. This is such a hard decision, but the love and dedication you’ve shown in recognizing her struggles and putting her needs first is truly admirable. Talking to your vet sounds like a compassionate next step to help guide you through this.

,"I’m so sorry. We arrived at the same place with our 15 year old parson russell terrier mix. He is either sleeping or pacing and we’ve tried lots of things (he’s on gabapentin, CBD, Selegiline, Adequan, chiropractor, etc.) and none of it has really stopped the progression of CCD. We made the decision a few weeks ago that it is time. He also doesn’t seek affection and doesn’t really receive our affection anymore, he still loves food and goes along on our walks, but you can just tell he’s aimless and doesn’t really get joy out of any of these things anymore. 

And as hard as it is to consider your own mental health and other responsibilities, please know that these are also valid considerations. I would clean up his messes and deal with his crazy behavior on walks (just will start veering off in any direction for no reason, gets turned around, etc.) until the end of time, but I think we have reached our capacity because *he’s* reached his capacity.

I would highly recommend finding an at-home euthanasia service. Granted, it’s a little more expensive, but it’s worth every penny. For your dog’s final moments you want them to be in the comfort of their own home, instead of a terrifying trip to the vet in a cold, empty exam room. Regardless, if your pet is suffering, as painful as it is for you, it is the best for them.

It’s one of the hardest things you will ever have to do, I’m not going to lie. It’s also so so difficult to watch everything you try to do, not really work to improve their lives. When we do this for a baby (or when they were little if you got them young like I did) all these pieces work goes towards them growing up and getting bigger/stronger. This is not the same.

"Old boy with CCD started having tics?
Hi everyone, 
first of all I want to say that this community has been of tremendous help to us. Here we have found a lot of information about doggy dementia our vet did not know anything about. This led to improvements in QoL for him and us and I cannot thank you enough.
This is Bonny, he is a 17,5 years old poodle.
He has had CCD symptoms for about 10 months now. He is on medication for hypothyroidism, heart problems and Cushing’s (4 years now!). He had night panic attacks but we have solved that with CBD, now his night/day cycle is relatively normal. Lately he started having these weird tics. Sometimes I massage his jaw and it stops, other times it lasts for several minutes. I have noticed a trend of this happening more often and the duration getting longer.
Has anyone had experience with something like this, or knows what might be the cause? I will be showing this to the vet as well. Thanks.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1iom214/old_boy_with_ccd_started_having_tics/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My girl has CCD. For the first time, she didn’t know me this morning… 
My girl (14 y.o. pittie) woke up as I was getting ready for work as usual. But she often comes into the bathroom to check on me and she was hanging out in the hallway. 

She didn’t know where she was and I called her to me and she didn’t come. I went over and she was shaking like a leaf and wouldn’t make eye contact. She was backed against the wall. I got her breakfast ready and the smell of the food helped. She turned away any time I went near her. I had to lure her to go outside with treats. 

Usually she follows me to the door as I leave because I give her a bone before I shut the door and she stayed in another room. It broke my heart. 

Yesterday she was so clingy and climbing all over me and sitting on me - which she has not done in months - so I gave up trying to do anything and just let her cuddle on me for a few hours. It was the sweetest, best feeling. 

It was such a complete 180 to this morning. It’s just proof that I don’t know how much longer she has. I’m not going to let her live in pain, and I am certainly not going to let her live in fear.

,"CCD is often described as 'doggy dementia' (in layperson's terms?).  One common denominator out of various symptoms is confusion.   Dogs will wander or suddenly become confused in their surroundings.   Mine will walk around and insist on going forward even when she encounters an obstacle - something that is either there usually or something new - and she'll just stop and wait there.   They often don't want to change direction or back up.   

If there is some diminished eyesight and hearing, it makes it worse (the experience for the dog is worse).   It the most severe conditions, I have read that a dog can become so confused, it doesn't remember ppl, other animals/dogs etc.   That's pretty severe and sad!  :-(

"CCD and euthanasia
I scheduled my nearly 15 yr old Boston Terriers euthanasia for Monday and I’m feeling conflicted. Her decline hasn’t been clear cut and she isn’t suffering from something obvious like cancer. She’s had Canine Cognitive Disorder or “doggie dementia” for well over a year. For most of the past 2 years, she’s gotten up multiple times a night every night to pace or use the bathroom. Although recently, she sometimes sleeps through the night and will only get up once I wake her in the am. She spends most of her days pacing, getting “stuck” in corners, or sleeping. She still eats her food and drinks water (although she’s been drinking an excessive amount lately). She has obvious hip pain but can still walk and go up and down the couple stairs to go outside. She is pretty much fully incontinent and has been to some degree since I got her. She is diapered full time which helps with the frequent accidents (both urine and feces) but the diapers have also caused sores. She also started having minor seizures in December but hasn’t had one in a month. The vet suspects she may have a brain tumor but we have not confirmed. Her blood work is not great but has been stable since I got her. She also has a heart murmur that has progressed slowly. 

What makes her situation challenging is a few things. 1) She was born deaf and was injured in the eye by a littermate so she has been deaf and blind in one eye since birth. Tracking her decline has been made much harder by this. 2) She was my family’s dog and we got her when I was in high school. I lived with her until I went to college. My mom unexpectedly passed away in 2021 from COVID and I took her in because I was the only one in my family able to care for her properly. So while she has been in my life for a long time, she has only been “my” dog for the past 3 years and she was already starting to decline at that point. 

I’m struggling because her decline feels like it isn’t clear cut. Her cognitive decline is obvious but she’s physically not too bad. She still eats, drinks, occasionally plays with my other dog, walks. But I worry that is suffering in a bunch of small ways. I scheduled her euthanasia after a particularly bad week she had but the past two weeks, she’s been decent. I’m having a hard time committing to the decision I made a few weeks ago. I’m looking for reassurance. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1iegw32/ccd_and_euthanasia/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Awwwww!! I get you! I just had my girl put down on Monday. Her problem was the opposite of your pups. My girls body failed her, but mentally she was still there. She had a very bad back, so her back legs were VERY weak and she had a hard time getting up. We were able to manage her pain with meds, but it was getting worse. I was having a hard time with IF I’d know (and acknowledge) that it was time, when that time came. Then this past Saturday she started limping and not putting any weight on her front left paw. 

I actually just sat down with her on Thursday of last week because she had an extremely hard time getting up a couple of times. I told her that if she was ready, I loved her enough to let her go. I didn’t want her to be in pain anymore. Then on Saturday she started limping. To me this was a sign that I absolutely HAD to acknowledge. I took her to the vet and he said that it was time, that she was in a lot of pain (he’s been my vet for 27 years and I would trust him with my life). I knew it was my duty to do what was best for her. You are doing the same for your baby. It is our responsibility to make the tough decisions for them when it’s time. It’s all part of loving them…you have to love them enough to let them go. My Jovi will be up there waiting for your pup when the time is right.

,"We faced the same decision last year. There were good times, & not so good times. Our sweet girl had CCD, was blind & deaf & incontinent. When we were home, we managed her care but any time we both left the house, we worried that something would happen. For a long time, we only left together for short periods, terrified we could come home to something bad. We too were waiting for the ‘right’ time but came to realized that there is no way to know what the ‘right’ time is. The best advice we got was to take our feelings out of the decision & base it on her. Once we did that, it became about giving her peace. We were going to grieve if it was done today, tomorrow or next month because we loved her so much.

,"We were in a very similar boat and put our baby to rest last Wednesday. We managed his pain and arthritis pretty good, but it was really the dementia that made us make the call. 

We would’ve cleaned up his daily multiple accidents until the end of time, but it felt like if we held on any longer he would be fully incontinent. For him, it wasn’t like his body physically lacked control, it was more so that his faculties were worsening. He’d go outside, but he’d pace and pace and get stuck before finally doing so. Rarely would he go out and go potty like he used to. 

And he would pace throughout the day even being on CBD and Selegiline. Near the end, it got harder to get him to lay down and stay down. He’d just pop up and pace. Puzzles and other stimulation helped, but nothing stopped the pacing that seemed to be getting worse. 

In his pacing and kind of mindless looking around, you could just see that he was aimless and lost, he was just stuck on some sort of conveyor belt. Even though he still loved food, it just wasn’t the same. We had to hand feed him his wet food even though he was barking and excited for it as I prepared it. He wasn’t interested in licking plates anymore, which he used to love. It’s noticing these kinds of changes that made us realize if we held on any longer then he was going to severely decline. 

Some tips from this reddit that really helped me: don’t confuse good moments with good days. We were definitely looking at the little glimpses of his old self as good days, even though they really were just good moments in days of pacing and lack of interest in things he used to love. 

Another was, don’t ask yourself “when is it time?” ask yourself “what am I waiting for?” We did not want to hit the cliff where he could have rapidly declined out of no where. We didn’t want his last day to be his worst day. I know if we held on we were just waiting for him to be fully incontinent or to stop eating or for him to have a stroke or something catastrophic. More than anything I wanted to make sure he could have his favorite treats, have a steak, and some last good walks before he went. It would have devastated me to say goodbye to him on the emergency table rather than at home, in the comfort of his bed, and with us there with him. These are the things that made me feel confident in our decision. 

It is so hard to gage when the right time is with dementia, since it can be a slow burn and there is no black and white signal that it is time. But from what you’ve described, I think you’re making the right choice. You want her to have some good last days. I wouldn’t wait for things to get worse because with dementia, you are playing roulette with where you are at in the timeframe from the start of dementia to wherever the cliff is. I think as long as your are in the window, you are making the compassionate choice 🤍",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1iegw32/ccd_and_euthanasia/#ma7t8nu,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Cuddly because of CCD?
We adopted Noodle in December 2021. She was found on the streets and was estimated to be around 10 years old. She was sweet and gentle but never cuddly. 

She was diagnosed with canine cognitive disorder a few months ago, and now she’s becoming more cuddly. Is this a normal thing with CCD? Don’t get me wrong, I love it.  But I also worry this means she’s getting worse, and that makes me cry. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this with CCD? Or any other changes that were opposite of how your dog was pre-CCD?

"Conflicted on saying goodbye to my 15 year old dachshund with CCD/dementia
Sorry this is very long but I need to tell my story and hopefully get validation and comfort in my decision.

tl;dr: My dog has dementia that's slowly been getting worse and it might be time to let him go.

Today is Wednesday and I scheduled a euthanasia appointment for my sweet pup for this coming Monday. He is \~15 year old dachshund and I've had him for over 14 of those years. Since 2022, he's been exhibiting all the classic signs of CCD: Pacing, getting stuck in corners, personality changes. He's been on a prescription diet, selegiline, and Senilife since the beginning.

For a really long time, his main symptom was aimless wandering and standing in corners. He seemed pretty undeterred though, getting himself out without assistance and carrying on his way, showing no anxiety. When he was tired of wandering, he'd get in his bed and rest. He stopped playing with toys within a year of diagnosis, but continued to play chase with the cat. Eventually he needed belly bands for his old man bladder but no big deal. While his personality was slowly fading, he was still essentially himself in my eyes. In addition to his cognitive meds, he was also on carprofen for arthritis.

A lot has changed in 2024. He started to circle along with his wandering/pacing. He gets stuck all the time. He had a tiny stroke. He started having nighttime anxiety. He needs calming meds (2 gabapentin, CBD, and a melatonin chew) to sleep through the night, but it's hit or miss. He also had to be moved from his bed in the bedroom into a round playpen in a separate room so he can get up and pace if he needs to without waking us up. He sometimes zones out when we go outside for walks and won't move. He zones out in front of his food bowl and it takes him a minute to realize what's going on before he starts eating. I have to hold up his bowl to his mouth to help him eat. He had to go off of carprofen in May and we were unsuccessful in getting him back on it (GI issues). We tried Galliprant and he also had side effects to that, though not as severe. He's starting to occasionally lose control of his bowels, and there's been a few times where we will go out on the weekend and come home to a poor pup who has pooped in his playpen and then gotten it stuck in his paws as he paced over it.

The last few months have been really hard for me. I've been obsessively trying to find ways to hold back the flood. Some things have worked and I wished I'd tried them sooner. Those things are Denamarin/SAMe, CBD, and Gold Standard Herbs Halscion. The combination has really helped his depression/anxiety and circling, and I'd recommend them to anyone else in this situation. But I digress. The amount of energy I've put into taking care of my dog has drained me completely. It's impacting my relationship with my boyfriend. It's impacting my performance at work (luckily I WFH). It's certainly impacting my mental health. I always feel exhausted and depressed, unable to really enjoy my life and feeling trapped.

After months of thinking about it but not truly taking the leap, this past weekend I really considered if now was time. Once I started to accept that it could be, my heart broke but it also felt like the most compassionate choice. I didn't think I was keeping him here for me, because everything I've gone through to keep him comfortable has been so difficult, but maybe I have been because now all I can think about is how much I'm going to miss him. It's also so hard because with dementia, there isn't an obvious moment to make the decision. I could keep him here longer, maybe much longer, if I really wanted to. We do get at least one slow walk in per day. He does eat his food. Thanks to the Denamarin/CBD/Halscion, he rests more during the day and paces less. He is on my lap now wrapped in a blanket, and it's everything to have him so close. Part of me wonders, what if.. what if we tried Galliprant again? What if we tried that other cognitive supplement? But I know it would at best give us a couple short months of only relative improvement. He's not doing the things dogs love to do. He doesn't interact with me much. No toys, no tail wags, no joyfully scarfing down his food or begging for treats. His essence is faded.

It feels like now would be the time to let him go, before his whole life is confusion and anxiety, while he still knows who I am and gets some comfort from my presence. It feels like we're in a compassionate window, where it might in fact not be too early and not too late. But how do I ever possibly go through with it? I am beside myself at the thought of him being gone forever. It's so so hard.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fp9c4p/conflicted_on_saying_goodbye_to_my_15_year_old/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You are doing the right thing. 

I'm not going to bore you with the details of my pet losses.  Just know, that making this decision doesn't come easy for anyone. A good pet owner always second-guess themselves. Why wouldn't they? They love their pets so much that they don't want to let them die. 

Now that you've made the choice, think about all the things that you need to do to fill his bucket list.  My biggest recommendation is the obvious one which is to spend as much time with him and take pictures, lots of pictures, and videos.  Some photographers offer free or discounted professional photos for dying pets.   Check out https://thetillyproject.org

I don't think you mentioned in your post whether you are going to have the euthanasia done at home or at the vet's office. I would highly suggest having it done at home.  The site below will let you search for at home euthanasia providers in your area.

I am really sorry that you have to go through this. It's going to suck any which way you slice it.  But you are going to bear the pain so that your puppy won't have to anymore.

,"I really relate to your story, I said goodbye to my 16.5 year old shih-tzu with advanced dementia on Aug 12. His dementia went downhill quickly over the course of three-ish months, and by the end I was so exhausted trying to keep him from hurting himself and worrying and medicating him and waking up multiple times in the middle of the night in a panic to check on him. I agonized over it for so long, because despite everything that was going on cognitively he still ate absolutely everything that was put in front of him and could go for short walks even though his mind was “gone”. 

In the end there was a day when I realized I could no longer leave him unsupervised in the house, so I picked a Monday, cancelled my plans for the weekend, fed him steak and ice cream and tons of other goodies, took him to his favourite park and was able to say goodbye peacefully with him in my arms at home. I miss him so so much (even all the fussing over him and medicating him and constant worrying about him) but in hindsight I’m so glad it didn’t come to an emergency situation where I would have to take him to a clinic in his confused state.

And in the end, we must grieve their loss in our own way.  The depths of grief are a direct reflection of the depths of love that you felt.  And the pain you feel is your heart turning your loss into memories.   

The pain of loss will fade and the memories will remain, and remembering them, you will smile and laugh again.

"Anxiety or CCD?
My dog has had, what we thought to be, very bad anxiety. At first it was only during storms. Then it was once every 2 weeks but lasting 1 day. Now he has gone 21 days straight with at least 2 “events” per day. It wasn’t until last night we took him into the ER when that vet said he might have CCD. We rescued our dog 8 years ago and have never known how old he is, but assumed he is close to 10 because he still acts and looks young. How did you all diagnose or recognize CCD in your dogs? What should we do?

When he has his events, it’s at any time of day and can be when nothing is happening. He will pace around constantly, scratch at any closed door, jump on top of furniture, and occasionally will pee uncontrollably in the house. Recently I have started to notice him staring and seeming to doze off (video below). 

[https://imgur.com/a/0G3LrIO](https://imgur.com/a/0G3LrIO)

Currently he is on a combination of fluoxetine and gabapentin but it doesn’t seem to be helping. I’ve seen other posts on Anipryl but not sure what we should be asking our vet for. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gzyz5p/anxiety_or_ccd/,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CCD and selegiline senior chiweenie 
My newly 17 year old chiweenie will be starting this med for CCD. Her symptoms are her staring at the wall occasionally, starting to get confused with breakfast and will walk away from bowl (does go back), and pacing. A few months ago she was going to the hinge side of the door as well. She actually stopped doing that, not sure why. Anyways, she is also on gabapentin at night for restlessness, keppra for seizures, carprofen, and Soloxine (hypothyroid managed since she was a pup) I found the generic 5mg of selegiline on Chewy and my vet said that’s okay to start with. I’m wondering if I should start her on half of that though. She’s pretty sensitive to medications it seems now that she’s older.

I was also recently recommended it by a neurologist for my other dog with seizures (but her seizures are mild and rare).

"comforting words about CCD?
hi all, i’ve never posted here before so i’m not sure if this type of post is welcome, but recently my 16 year old gal got diagnosed with dementia and i could use some positivity. her quality of life and physical health are still pretty impressive according to the vet but i’ve been feeling guilty/scared/sad that she might not remember her better days anymore. i’ve been trying to find humor in her silly new behaviors, but sometimes it’s hard to do alone. i always get condolences when i ask for support, but what i really want is to just hear some positive acceptance.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1d60uu2/comforting_words_about_ccd/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think the silly things make it a lot easier. My buddy will walk into his food bowl and stand in his water. When we’re walking and someone comes near us or gets out of a car he stops and stares at them. It’s kind of embarrassing but so sweet lol. 

But I totally get how you feel. It’s really hard to accept that they don’t know/remember/do the things they used to love. It breaks my heart that he doesn’t play with toys anymore or seems to love walks anymore because those were his *favorite* before his decline. 

My husband tries to encourage me to believe that he’s still happy and fine doing the things he does now. Which I think is true, I don’t think he knows any different, you know? Because if they did then they probably would at least try to engage in activities they used to do. I think they adjust pretty easily because they’re such adaptive animals. Now I just try to engage with him on his new level. So we still do walks but I’m about to get a stroller. I will try to play with his old toys but if he doesn’t engage then we do a puzzle. He has not lost his love of food so we do lots of puzzles and mental stimulation with treats! And he’s a sleepier boy now too so I take in all the cuddles and how sweet he is when I can move about the house without waking him up.

"Pain, PTSD, or CCD for a 13 year old Chihuahua?
My wife and I have 3 pets: 13m chihuahua, 13f cat, and 1.5m chihuahua. I work at home so I am with the pets all day, my wife works outside the house and is home mornings and evenings. The cat hides in the basement since the puppy has been introduced. We want her to eventually be able to be comfortable around the young chi to join us upstairs. Dogs get walked multiple (4+) times per day. They also both sleep with us in our bed.

We found the younger chihuahua this past August on the street. When no one claimed him, we decided to keep him and he was neutered eight weeks ago. He is very sweet and affectionate 95% of the time, but occasionally will snap, go berserk and viciously snap at the 13m chihuahua and occasionally my wife.  He has now bit my wife on 3 occasions. Each time these bites happen if he is disturbed when resting or woken up. We will also have to hold him back because he has a tendency to redirect it towards our older Chihuahua if he is nearby. His demeanor always goes back to normal (which is very affectionate/tolerant) after a quick separation, but. We have hired a dog trainer who has told us that this behavior is because he is scared, and that when he is burrowed up or sleeping he becomes really reactive. we are working on training methods to lesson these responses, which will hopefully calm him down enough for our cat and our elder Chihuahua

The 13m chihuahua is our primary concern. My wife has had him since he was a puppy, and he has always been a very snuggly and affectionate dog. After finding the younger chi the 13m Chihuahua was diagnosed with pituitary Cushing's disease (which was otherwise not in full swing yet), and found to have some mass cell tumors that had to be removed (one in the center of his chest and the other on his rear leg leaving some pretty serious scars). These tumors were rated low on both of the relevant grading scales when lab work was done, and they had clean margins when removed. They also did an x-ray of his lungs, which were clear of any cancer and they did his bloodwork, which did not alert them to anything other than the Cushing's. When in recovery  the younger chi because the younger would snap at our senior about once per day, and as a toothless old man, he wasn't really able to defend himself. Fortunately we were able to intervene before any real conflict broke out. The 13m Chi had to get stitches removed 2 weeks post-op and did not take the experience well by yelling and howling throughout the whole process (he turned 13 the day after). Now, six weeks post-op and four weeks post stitch removal, our once very affectionate and physical chi is acting totally different.  The combination of the new stressful younger chi puppy, medical scares for the older chi, and a recent tragic loss of a friend, has caused an overall very anxious and sad vibe in our home since the beginning of October, which I fear is exacerbating these problems.

What was once a very snuggly, kissy, and physically affectionate dog has gotten very touch sensitive and will yelp, growl, and retreat just a few feet away when we attempt to touch.  This behavior is more pronounced in the evening, which is unfortunate, because this is when my wife gets home and she is unable to love her baby boy.  He will stand a few feet away from us, and just growl lowly, tail wagging. He will then hop up and beg to be held, only by me at this point, where he can be touched and pet as normal (he will also give kisses). If we are on the couch, he will sit in physical contact with us (either next to us or on top of us directly) but any attempt to touch him with our hands is met with the response mentioned above. We brought him to our vet, who did a routine physical, and ruled out any obvious physical pain through applying pressure to his body and joint manipulation. He had been in surgery recently, and so they had a fairly recent physical and bloodwork for him, and we had just dropped off a stool sample with no red flags. She also ruled out any cataract caused blindness and hearing loss. She prescribed Senilife, which he has been on a little less than 2 weeks, to help with any potential cognitive decline, and she also prescribed painkillers in case any residual pain from the surgery was causing this behavior. He was only on the painkillers for a few days, before she took him off of them to see if there was any change. I was out of town at this time, and my wife was their primary caretaker. During this week of my absence, she said that he was feeling and acting a lot better. When I came back from my trip, he started acting up again. Our vet told us not to start him back on the painkillers, but encouraged us to provide chewable CBD tablets (5mg / day) and Melatonin in the evening. With another week of no visible improvement, she has now prescribed Gabapentin in the evenings, which we started yesterday. As of now, he has not been on any of these supplements or medications for more than 2 weeks. Maybe we need to stick with the routine a little longer to begin seeing results?

He is still excited for food and has a healthy appetite, very alert, and has a good trotting when he is on his many daily walks (he is enthusiastic when we put on his harness, no touch sensitivity at all). He doesn't play as much with the new puppy as he did when they first were introduced, but I attribute that to the age difference, the surgery, and any residual pain he might be in. He does get very short tempered when the puppy wants to play with him, but they sleep next to each other all day by my feet when I am working with no incident.  I had a dog with CCD before, and she was not acting like this when she succumbed, but maybe this is early stages? He doesn't get stuck behind things. At night he has some trouble using his doggy steps (which he was normally very proficient in) but that has been occurring ever since the new dog was introduced, and there was a lot of early nighttime conflict on the steps between the two. Throughout the day he manages to use them fine. He will sleep cuddled in my wife's arms the whole night, occasionally waking up and going to the bathroom, or he will get up and growl at us from the bed (perhaps at the puppy?). He will then come back to his spot in her arms when asked. He has always been trained to use an indoor pee-pad for all of his bathroom needs and he is consistent in using them (when I don't take them out). I filled out a CCDR evaluation, and depending on how I interpreted some of his recent behaviors, he was either not suffering from CCD, or in the ""At Risk"" bracket. I have one of those cross body dog carry bags, and when he is it he is as snuggly and calm as he has always been. He is more tolerant of my contact then of my wife.

For our older Chihuahua we mainly have the following concerns:

1. He is in still in some form of pain from the surgery or from another source.

2. He has developed touch sensitivity as a result from the trauma of the last few weeks of surgery and overall environment of our house. We hope that this can be modified or will lessen with training / time / pharmaceutical intervention.

3. He is exhibiting symptoms of CCD and we will need to start some kind of treatment. I've heard positive things about ""herbal"" oil, as well as Senilife. I have read that Anipryl (Selegiline) is the only FDA approved medication for CCD treatment as well as Cushings. 

4. Some combination of the above.

Looking for any advice or anecdotes. Part of me knows that the treatments he is on have just started, and they will take time. But I also try and practice ""Hope for the best, prepare for the worst."". We just want to have our sweet old dog back to normal, or at the very least comfortable and at ease.  I have done a QoL evaluation, and he seems to be still very much in the healthy range. We hope that with a few weeks of treatment and training, this behavior will subside.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/17wyccy/pain_ptsd_or_ccd_for_a_13_year_old_chihuahua/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Is it possible to keep the dogs in separate areas while the older dog recovers?

How soon after surgery did the new behavior start? My senior chi who was displaying very mild CCD symptoms (just wandering, getting stuck in corners) HAD to go in for a dental, his bloodwork came back GREAT, his heart was in great shape but after anesthesia he immediately started declining and the dementia got markedly worse.

We did do a ton of supplements, Senilife, blueberry extract powder and salmon oil which did seem to help. We also made sure he was comfortable and had no stress.

We did eventually also try selegeline. We had poor results but some people report great results so maybe join some CCD FB groups and get some advice there.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/17wyccy/pain_ptsd_or_ccd_for_a_13_year_old_chihuahua/#k9kiv54,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Having the quality of life/end of life talk with our vet this weekend and the anticipatory grief is so painful
This is my Rosie girl, she’s 13 (but recently the vet said she thought Rosie may be older), her back legs don’t work and her CCD (doggie dementia) is getting worse… she’s confused and just doesn’t seem happy anymore.

I gonna miss your funny *boops* and our ""find me Willy"" games.

It warms my heart so, to hear you call out my name. 

You're the love of my life, my partner in joy...

My favorite noise in this house...my hearts best toy ...

I wish I could stay longer, and grow older with you... 

But the sand in a dogs hourglass, disappears faster than dew...

Just know I loved doing everything together...even howling in tune

In your truck, on the couch, and the long walks under our moon...

I wish I could stay, but my body says it's time...

From the hurt in my bones, to the milk in my eyes.

To feel your touch once more...says your love is still mine...

To feel your hands hold my face, 
makes my eyes search for thines.

I'll miss all my family, and the warm hugs from the rest...

But just know this to be true...

I always loved you best...

"What made you decide it was time? CCD
What was the final factor that made you decide it was time to let your senior dog with canine cognitive disorder go? 

I’ve been working with so many specialists and been tossed between them all that I feel alone in this decision. I’ve never had to put a dog down and I am really struggling with the morality of it. 

I have hit a breaking point with my own sleep deprivation and it’s affecting all aspects of my life as I feel housebound. She is so dependent on me. I don’t want to give up because I’m struggling to keep up. 

Sadie is 14+ with CCD - ruled out brain tumor, stroke, (though they suspect mini strokes), cushings, etc. 

She is now whining off and on all day and night, even with trazodone or gabapentin. Tried cbd with no luck. I have to guide her everywhere. Circles and walks into walls. Blind. Still loves to eat. I’ve heard they’re likely not in pain if they’re still eating, but if she’s crying out because of anxiety - anxiety is mentally painful. 

My doctor said she hasn’t had much luck with anipryl and has seen it only cause worse side effects. I feel like we have nothing left to try. 

I feel really stuck and don’t feel like I can make this decision on my own. Her body seems okay so the idea of putting her down for her mind seems so wrong to me. Being so worried about keeping her alive for 14 years, how can I be the one to do it.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/xtvert/what_made_you_decide_it_was_time_ccd/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"So sorry that you and your dog are going through this. It sounds like it may be time. We went through the same thing with our dog. It is such a difficult and horrible decision to have to make. 

Our dog was 13-14 (he was a rescue, so not quite sure). He was blind and had CCD. He slept a lot and when he was awake he frequently paced in circles. It was especially heartbreaking when he whined while he was circling, and sometimes he circled so fast he would get dizzy and stumble.  We would try to comfort him but he really wasn’t interested.

Same as you, we thought his body is ok…no cancer, no heart failure…how can we end his life? And he was still eating and drinking water.

As difficult as it was, we began to face that it really wasn’t fair to let our dear boy live his days like this. We felt the same as you that the anxiety is mentally painful.  He really had no quality of life. 

We had been working with our vet for about nine months with his CCD. She also said she had not had much luck with the anipryl. We called and asked for an appointment for one last evaluation on a Friday. She said it would be the right thing to do. We just needed that confirmation. We made the appointment for Monday and had one last weekend with him. It was so terribly hard and we miss him so much, but we knew our boy would be at peace.

I know how awful it is to make this decision.  I just wanted someone to tell me it was ok. I want you to know it’s ok. You have done so much for her taking her to specialists, researching, caring for her and of course a lifetime of love.

,"Curious if you have tried Selegiline. It’s a prescription drug (costly) but seems to have helped my guy a bit. There are other supplements my vet suggested but they were high in fat and my guy has pancreatitis (so needs to be on a low fat diet). I also keep my boy in belly bands because he no longer tells me when he needs to go outside. Do you think she’s whining because of pain? I also gave my dog on Amantandine for pain. I think he’s more mobile since starting it. 
Finally look up end of life checklist for dogs. You can rate many factors of the dogs quality of life to see where she is in this regard.

,"My JRT/Rat Terrier Sochu (who celebrates birthday #16 on Wednesday!) was really struggling with his arthritis in late November of last year. He could barely walk, he couldn’t run up the stairs to his crate (his safe space), and he’d sometimes even fall over when lifting his leg. 

I self-referred to a veterinary rehab in December: they feature laser therapy, acupuncture, exercise/balance equipment, and an underwater treadmill. It’s there that I learned about Líbrela. My boi isn’t able to take NSAIDS because of concurrent kidney issues, so when the rehab vet told me Líbrela was a monoclonal antibody that wouldn’t affect his kidneys, I gave it a shot (no pun intended). 

Within just a few hours, my Sochu-boy was walking like his old self again, able to climb up the stairs, and keep up with his younger “sister” (my 11-year-old Schnoodle, Ziggy) on walks. 

He’s also on gabapentin and I’ve pretty well perfected the titration on the dose of it to where his pain’s controlled and he’s not drowsy.

My boy, Ted. He's 12 1/2 years old. He has Canine Cognitive Disfunction...aka doggie dementia.  His symptoms started very subtly. Almost unnoticeable at first. The last month or 2, though, has been really trying on us. His symptoms progressed so quickly.  The sundowning is the biggest issue at the moment.  Ted just howls and whines to the point that NO ONE sleeps. The vet has prescribed a pretty good cocktail that keeps him comfortable for about 8 hours straight. We bought him diapers with suspenders to ensure he makes it through the night without peeing everywhere.

She doesn’t really sundown, thankfully, but she doesn’t remember what the outdoors are for, or why she wanted to go out.

,"Mine is a 100-lb senior Great Dane/GSD. She always followed her older lab ""sister"" and kind of never really had to make decisions most of her life. Sister did something, and she followed. We finally had to say goodbye to our lab just after Thanksgiving (I'm still crying at least once a day but I'm counting it as a good thing that I still have so much love in my heart for her) and it's been an adjustment. 

So now our old lady is on her own, and it's up to her to decide when she feels like doing activities or what she wants to do, or even to choose a direction on walks. We were so worried she'd be adrift after being so used to happily just following and not having to make choices. And she was for a bit, but now she's more self-assured at this age than ever. 

Unfortunately, it does coincide with a bit of sundowning, so this giant dog who's suddenly feeling a little pushy is now huge, pushy, AND a bit confused. 

We are using gabapentin 300mg as-needed, which is currently maybe 2 nights a week on average. If the weather is bad or the routine is off schedule, maybe a bit more frequently. I changed my own routine to be with her once evening hits. Where I used to be doing little tidying tasks around dusk, I've shifted to now be in my cozy clothes and just near her. She's got that shepherd guarding/herding thing going on, dialed up to 11 with the recent change in our family partnered with her feeling anxious at night. She just wants to herd us all together, and then needs to look at us for a good long while to feel like we're all here and accounted for and safe. 

One little random trick is we started ""tipping her out"" at the ""end of her shift"". Basically, we give her a little bit of kibble, like maybe 1/4 cup at most, and take one more trip outside to pee. Then we come back in and thank her for doing such a good job today and tell her she's ""clocked out"". I know it sounds totally ridiculous, but it's like getting your tips from the house at the end of the night, which flipped a switch in my brain, so I experimented to see if it helped her. And most of the time, it does. 

All this to say, you're doing great. They get confused, and just like with the rest of our family, it can be helpful to have a consistent, low-stress routine that helps everyone feel grounded, secure, and safe. Some nights are easier than others, but we just roll with it and do our best in the spirit of mutual love and loyalty to our canine companions.

"How many months/years of sundowning before you made the call?
Hi all. Just curious, for those who went through CCD and sundowning, how long did you handle it before making the call to put them to sleep?

My dog’s first bout of sundowning happened summer of ‘23. We started to manage his pain and liver issues and it really wasn’t too bad. He only paced in the evening and still today goes to bed and stays asleep for the night. However, the daily pacing and accidents have ramped up in the last couple months

So much so that my husband and I kind of had a dose of reality yesterday when we remembered how only in the spring of this year we decided we wouldn’t do any vacations or overnights because we didn’t feel comfortable leaving him with a babysitter or having someone just do potty breaks. And how now, after just the last month or two, we are like there’s absolutely no way we could leave him. Although he is manageable, he still requires around the clock care. 

He has started going in the house very frequently (sometimes 3 times a day) which is fine, really not a big deal. When he does go potty outside, especially at night, he will start rapidly pacing and following a path over and over again. When it snowed the other week he got stuck on this path and started barking for help so we had to do a search and rescue operation. This has been happening a lot at night where we’ll let him pace in hopes he’ll go, but eventually we have to call it and direct him back inside. I don’t think it’s just a vision thing (although when you call for him, even right in front of him, he looks off trying to find us), he’s just frantically pacing. 

This is in addition to constant pacing throughout the day. Eventually I can get him to lay down, but he will be restless for a good portion of the day, and then it happens again in the evening. 

I’m just trying to gage if I have blindness to these issues because in most aspects he still seems happy to be here and fortunately is sleeping through the night. Or if this kind of pacing and the accidents are worthy of letting him rest. 

He is on gabapentin, galliprant, and denamarin. We started selegiline ~1.5 months ago, not seeing  much from that yet. And I started him on senelife today. He’s a parson Russel mix and turned 15 in August.

,"We were at the point of calling Lap of Love to plan for saying goodbye, but we reached out to a holistic vet first.  She recommended and guided us with CBD oil and that was a game changer.  Our girl needed nothing else- the CBD oil stopped the pacing, panting, spinning, anxiety....everything.  We got an extra year with her until we ended losing her to another issue.  Maybe that could help your boy.  He's on so many things right now, which honestly, could be making the issue worse.  The side effects of many of the medications commonly prescribed for CCD are the same as the symptoms of CCD.  Our vet basically said cut everything out and give the CBD oil a shot.  If you have a holistic vet in your area or if there is one you could telemed, that would be a good option.  You have nothing to lose.  CCD is manageable, you just have to find the right supplement (or sometimes medication) that works or a combination of them.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gucdn0/how_many_monthsyears_of_sundowning_before_you/#lxtdflg,,,,,,,,,,,,

Added in melatonin pm, then melatonin am and pm plus CBD oil. The CBD has made the most difference. She’s not zombified at all, she is her usual sweet prancing funny girl self. I’ve had times where I’ve run out of CBD and it’s very noticeable.

My 14 year old boy has been having horrible sundowners. It’s literally like trying to get a baby/toddler to get to sleep. I make sure to take him out before bed, he has eaten plenty, is on gabapentin, trazadone, and carprovet. He has all of his needs met and he’ll stand at the edge of my bed and whine in my face until I do something for him. It’s driving me mad.

,"That’s tough. Our dog started sundowning a month before he passed (not saying that’s what’s going to happen to your little boy). We would have to wake up in the middle of the night every night just to help him out. He would also pace around for hours and pant, even though it was really cold. We didn’t know how to help him either. We would be up with him for hours until he fell asleep. There’s no easy answer. Each dog is different. As long as he is still eating and breathing fine, and not in pain, count your blessings. Try to be patient. We would also get frustrated with our little boy and upset.

,"Sundowning was one of the milder symptoms of CCD my dog experienced, but it took a toll on us due to the constant lack of sleep. At the time, I didn’t understand why some vets prescribed medications like Gabapentin and Trazodone for CCD. Many traditional vets, while well-intentioned, seem less familiar with CCD and its management.

Our girl's symptoms were severe- spinning in tight circles until she fell over, panting, pacing, and overwhelming anxiety. It was heartbreaking, and we began considering euthanasia. We’d cared for other CCD dogs before, but nothing as intense as this. Desperate for a solution, we consulted a holistic vet, and everything changed.

The holistic vet explained that medications like Gabapentin and Trazodone might actually worsen CCD symptoms, as they’re not designed for this condition. Under her guidance, we stopped those medications and tried CBD oil. Honestly, I wasn’t optimistic, but once we found the right dose and gave it about a week, the results were incredible.

The CBD oil didn’t sedate her- it calmed her and brought back a sense of her former self, before CCD took hold. Her symptoms disappeared, and we finally found relief for her and ourselves.

Since then, I’ve joined a few CCD support groups on Facebook (you can easily search for them), and I’ve learned about other helpful supplements like Senilife and Lion’s Mane. Some people also have success with melatonin, though it didn’t work for us. For our girl, CBD oil was nothing short of a miracle.

If you’re dealing with CCD, I strongly recommend consulting a holistic vet. Telemedicine appointments are widely available, making it easier than ever to connect with one.

"Suggestions for large breed Sundowners/Anxiety
Our 11 year old 85-90lb wonderful girl has undergone a massive shift in a weeks time. For about 4 days now she's been showing what our vet believes is anxiety and won't rule out CCD. Through various blood, fecal and urine tests as well as xrays we have ruled out any negative conditions there requiring treatment. Based on our observations over the past couple days, it's been suggested she is dealing with Sundowners as she is unable to sleep at night and very restless, often shaking where ever she's chosen to rest at any given time. We do, however, see glimpses of our normal spunky girl like a 3-4 hours stretch yesterday afternoon where she wasn't shaking, was playing fetch and being interested in what we are having for dinner. 

My partner and I are beside ourselves. Just 1 week ago we would never have thought this would be a possibility, but here we are confronting this sad reality and looking for help/suggestions. 

The vet set us up with 150mg tabs of Trazodone with a range of 1 1/3 to 2 1/2 tabs every 12 hours. Confronting a possible 3rd straight sleepless night, we started her on the low end with 1.5 tabs. We saw minimal to no effect as the restlessness, pacing, and shaking has continued throughout the night. She's never been vocal, and we are thankful for that given our current environment at home.

Anyone have any experiences or ideas on what we could float to our vet next? They said we would know quickly if the trazadone worked. We just gave our 2nd dose and upped it to 2 pills in hope the poor girl can rest and just get some sleep. 

Thank you for any help or suggestions you can offer. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ics2vb/suggestions_for_large_breed_sundownersanxiety/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Dementia can be a slow burn, but it can also seem to come out of no where. That’s how we experienced it. One night our baby was getting up and down from the couch, went into the kitchen to look back at us, just over and over. He was shaking like a leaf so I took him to the emergency room. That was the first time I heard about dogs sundowning. 

I couldn’t believe they picked it up right away when I thought we were there because he hurt himself or was having some sort of allergic reaction. They did diagnose him with chronic pain and so we started on gabapentin, daily. That did really well for about a year, then we also introduced galliprant. Our vet said that sometimes they need that little extra to be comfy, so adding galliprant can really help. 

Anyway, our beginning was very much like how you described your experience. We had him for another year and a half and fortunately he didn’t sundown at night. He paced a lot throughout the day, but we could normally get him to settle down. He was on ElleVet CBD, gabapentin, Selegiline for the dementia, and we also did Adequan shots and saw a doggy chiropractor. I think we managed his pain pretty well in the end, but it was the lack of joy he had in life and his favorite things (toys and eventually food) that had us make the call. The benefit to CCD is that you have hindsight now to savor every moment and give her everything you’ve got 🤍

But I would definitely look into CBD and Selegiline for cognitive function (I think we started these too late to see a major difference, so I’d try them as soon as practicable). And I’ve seen lots of people use Trazadone on here, but yes the dosing can be tricky. Don’t give up on it yet! I mention all the pain stuff because the pacing and everything can also be chronic pain that is coming on, especially if she has arthritis. We didn’t find our’s arthritis until he went in for an ultrasound for an unrelated issue. 

Good luck with everything. CCD and senior care in general is very hard, so don’t beat yourself up for having caregiver fatigue or if you experience anticipatory grief. Your girl is lucky to have you 🤍",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ics2vb/suggestions_for_large_breed_sundownersanxiety/#m9twcc4,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"So sorry you are going through this. I have been dealing with something very similar to this with my almost 12 year old Yorkie for quite some time. The first type of meds they put her in did nothing to help with her anxiety and her constant pacing, so now we are trying something new and hoping it helps. We follow up with vet again soon. It’s a roller coaster ride 😢

I relate and sympathize with your situation. I think it may be trial and error trying to figure out what helps them best. My vet said it might take us a while to find the best solution for her. One thing that has oddly helped my little one is a onesie type outfit that fits her very snuggly and seems to comfort her and settle her sometimes. I had purchased them after she had surgery in the fall to keep her from bothering the stitches and she really likes them. So awhile back I thought I’d try to put one on her and surprisingly it really seems to help her settle and sleep a bit more  and she gets anxious when I take them off to wash them. Not sure if that is helpful but it does seem to be helping our situation a bit. 

She also recently became obsessed with our electric blanket which seemed to clam her. So I ordered her a large heating pad that I keep covered with her favorite blanket and she seems to rest better with that on her bed. 

Sorry for the novel. I know a lot of us senior dog parents are dealing with this sundowning and I am sure you will get some good advice here. Following in the hopes of some good tips. 

Hang in there! I know how hard it is and exhausting. Sending positive vibes to you and your fur baby ❤️",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ics2vb/suggestions_for_large_breed_sundownersanxiety/#m9txjyx,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Hey! For my anxious (most likely traumatized in or before dog shelter) senior, gabapentin and catnip help a lot. He got the gabapentin mostly for his osteoarthritis but it has eased the stress symptoms. He does get a bit stressed when the gabapentin ""peaks"" but after that he's more relaxed. 

He once ate my cats' catnip and I immediately googled if it's safe and turns out that it is safe and also can work as a sedative for some dogs. For him it definitely does - I add some to his meals and he usually takes at least a 2-3 hour nap afterwards. Maybe give that a try? 

For more stressful situations like when I'm away for a night or two or when we have to visit someone (he gets stressed when we're not at home or outdoors) he takes alprazolam. 

The best relief has always been long walks but as they get older it's not always possible/safe especially if it's very hot or cold outside :/

"Mentally struggling with senior dog
Just hoping someone understands and maybe has advice. 

My 16 year old chihuahua has been declining cognitively since late 2022. She started going through an extremely aggressive phase that year which is so unlike the cuddly, needy dog that she’s always been. At that time I took her to the vet and besides some stiff joints she was in perfect health. The vet had said it was possibly CCD. the aggression went away about 6 months later and she was letting me pet her and hold her again. We moved to a new state this summer and she’s been displaying what seems like sundowning. At night I keep her and my younger dog in their own room but she will stand by the door and scratch at the door, pace, whimper, drag her bed onto her pee pad and so on. Just weird behaviors that start at about 1am. Her sight and hearing are going too. Overall she does seem zoned out a lot. She has her days when she’s more alert and will seem eager on our walks but mostly her tail is pointing down, her back legs seem stiff and weak (she tends to look like she’s about to squat) she does show affection but in a zoned out way. Not the way she used to. I’m losing sleep every night. I tried giving her cbd but it doesn’t seem to help. I feel like a terrible person because I get so frustrated at night with her but I’m just tired and this is not who my dog was, it’s like a different dog. But she still eats and drinks still will go on light walks. Seems to have joint issues but doesn’t seem to be in pain. What do I do? I don’t know how quickly dementia progresses and I’m afraid to let her suffer if she is. Any advice or just words of support from anyone that’s been through this will help :(

Update-scheduled a vet appointment in two weeks. Hoping for some guidance from the vet. Just wanted to say THANK YOU to all who commented. It’s not an easy journey but boy does it help to feel less alone. 💙",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ficv0g/mentally_struggling_with_senior_dog/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Currently going through something like this. It's so puzzling and difficult to know what to do when they still want to move around and still have an appetite. I am constantly trying to figure out what is going on with my dog, what she needs, how I can help her. I am so exhausted and I don't even know if euthanasia would be to stop her suffering or mine at this point. I genuinely cannot tell if my dog is suffering, or if she is just very frustrated with me because her needs have changed and I have failed to adapt.

My vet hasn't had any available appointments for a while, but today I called and begged them for help, they gave me a spot from a cancellation tomorrow. I don't know what to tell you about your dog, I can only talk about mine unfortunately. But my very best advice is to go see your vet and have a direct conversation about whether your dog is suffering (not just physically but also mentally - anxiety, fear, other mental distress), how to gauge her current quality of life, what your options are to help her, what you can expect as her decline continues, whether it's time to euthanize, and if not, how to know it's time. Vets deal with death A LOT so they should be able to have this conversation.

Personally I'm making a list of all the things I want to talk about - physical pain, mental pain, hunger levels, energy levels, and socializing. I'm noting the changes I've seen in her in each of these areas and the questions I have. 

I'm also going to ask the vet the big questions: Are the behaviors I'm describing indicators that she's suffering? Is there anything we can do (reasonably) to treat what's happening with her, or have we exhausted all the reasonable options? Is it time to euthanize? 

I hope I can get some guidance, and I hope you can, too.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ficv0g/mentally_struggling_with_senior_dog/#lngh9us,,,,,,,,,,,,

i do not really sleep due to anticipation of terrifying seizure screams that come most often in middle of the night, and also he gets restless lately overnight and every little movement keeps me up

i do notice the restlessness gets better after acupuncture. something for you to consider if available 

his mobility has been an ongoing issue since he had a stroke last year. he has a great chiropractor. but at this age things fall apart again quickly 

oh and he developed a phobia of walking outside last month on day one of vacation. he hasn’t gotten over it even back home. so he won’t walk outside, which means he’s atrophying fast

,"Hi. I’m in the thick of it with CCD and bad arthritis. 14 year old pittie.

She paces at night, whines, sometimes just goes and sits in another room staring at nothing. It wakes me up every time because sometimes she will pee or poop - and she literally avoids any and all pee pads.

Her joints are a mess. She has one good leg and her others just give out randomly. After a small bit of playing - which she really wants to do a few times a day - she will pant in pain for a long while after. She often poops as she walks because squatting hurts. She loves car rides but it’s difficult for me to get her in and out alone. No more jumping in or out.

She’s not as cuddly, but then a few times a week she will fall asleep on me and I don’t dare move.

She is on carprofen for anti-inflammatory but it wears off faster lately, Gabapentin for pain which was 2x a day and is now 3, and trazadone to help her sleep through the night. 

I think I have less than a month left with her. Watching her shudder and pant in pain, stumble and wobble around the house is honestly killing me.

,"Hi! I'm in the same boat and lots of people here as well. Tbh I thought this sub is more for people like us, but unfortunately I see mostly RIP posts here, which breaks my heart! It is horrible that most people here lost their dogs and so little have their dogs alive.

I do struggle on a daily basis so much with my dog. She is 14 and middle size so I guess I should be grateful, since many dogs only live 12 ish but I do sometimes feel like she could die already (I feel really ashamed) and its so wrong to think in that way, because it only happens when our dog has bad days. But other days, she is totally fine and I would never want her to be gone.
Only thing that helps keep my sanity when things are bad, is to think how little time with her I have. Your dog is 16, she can die any day. Even if she has good days, she can just stop being one day and there will be nothing you csn do about it. That will be the worst thing ever...so I'm trying to remind myself  that, every time that I fell like giving up on her. I also teach myself to reach out to people when it's bad. Many times I feel like I should not bother my friends or family with my dog's health. But you should! These are the people to reach out and it feels so much better when you have someone to talk to. 

I feel like every time our dog has a good day, its so worth it to struggle weeks or months for that. Thinking realistically about her age,  she wont be having that many good days so I want to cherrish that. 

I think it would be good for you to save that post somewhere and go back whenever you struggle. I will do the same. You can see that a lot of people struggle here and we all have good intentions and would do anything for our dogs.

I'm going through something similar with my 16 year old chihuahua. The sudden cognitive decline this past year has been so tough to witness him go through. He had his first seizure a few weeks ago and started sun downing this past weekend. Besides that, his blood work and appetite has been normal which makes this even more difficult. We suspect that the seizure that kicked this off was because of Librela which has been known to have such side effects. He was 3 months in before this happened. At this point, we're just finding ways to manage his sundowning and arthritis.

"Senior Dog Won’t Stop Pacing!
I am making this post because I’m not sure where to turn too at this time at night, and the vets in my area are closed. So my senior dog (14 yrs old) has been non stop pacing and panting around the house. She was fine earlier in the day, and all of sudden she just kept pacing. I tried sitting her down next to me and calming her down but nothing is working. She eats and drinks, but she won’t stop pacing. It’s been an hour already and I figured by now she would be tired, but she keeps going. I’m not sure what to do, and everything I look up just keeps giving me anxiety.

"Dental Surgery on Seniors 
Nikko (15 rapidly approaching 16) gave me a scare Friday, we awoke to an angry abscess and went to the emergency vet before work and actually returned to them after work. Nikko has suspected IVDD (managed at this time ) and periodontal disease (advanced). His regular vet has recommended dental surgery in the past but due to my concerns over anesthesia at his age respected our wishes and thinks he is actually in very good health, he gets blood work for NSAIDs every six months which has been perfect and has done very well until this weekend. The antibiotic regiment has him feeling much better but I booked an appointment with a recommended local vet (not his usual) that has experience with senior dental work and we go for his first evaluation there today. To say I'm conflicted is an understatement. His heart is supposedly great up as far as his last check up, his lungs sounded good for his age, he had a chest X-ray last year to check for a tumor bc of horners syndrome which was clear. He did show some sundowing which was actually remarkably resolved via a supplement recommended by the vet (senilife). I cannot see him in pain like he was this weekend, I suspect he's often in pain I don't see given how good they can be at masking, I know based on the emergency vet input that he probably broke a rear tooth and I know I will find out more today from our visit but I'm just consumed by worry inspite of my best efforts to be in the moment with him. I see my generally healthy and happy boy and think about how wonderful it would be for him to be completely pain free dental wise, I also think about the risk, anecdotal as it may be, of advancing CCD from anesthesia, I think of the post surgical higher risk in recovery based on age, I think about what if his suspected IVDD is actually a spinal stroke, etc so on, I know this community gets it! I will absolutely be listening and asking questions with the new vet today but wanted to see if anyone had experiences they would be willing to share and also just to get it off my chest to people who understand. I doubt there's an alternative for him at this point but the vet will know best I suppose...I took a picture of the handful of pills he gets as a morning dose to remind myself that there is a reality of the inevitable and his current existence, while ok right now is dependent on these pills as it is. We have been so blessed together and he has always been there for me and I just want to make the best decision for him as possible. If there is no alternative to surgery than that is it, but if there is how to make that decision confidently...if it were me I still am not sure what I would do because I'm a surgery weenie lol so that doesn't help as I'm sure Nikko is braver than I am💜",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1g8ohax/dental_surgery_on_seniors/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"How did you know when your dog got dementia? 


I have a 14 year old Pomeranian who I love dearly, he's my first dog and I just want to make the right choice (my apologies if this is long) 

A few months ago, my pup developed dry eyes which required me to do daily eye drops. After a few weeks of this, he started to become reactive when I got close to him so I stopped the medication. Luckily, it’s summer and he no longer has dry eyes. 

In the past few months, he’s become more and more aggressive towards me, my boyfriend and everyone that he knows. It’s to the point where I can’t even put his leash on without him biting my hands. I’m not sure if it’s to do with being upset about the past treatment plan, but I’m also starting to wonder if it’s dementia/cognitive decline. 

He seems upset and confused most of the day and was the most cuddly dog in the past. 

He still eats normally, uses the washroom outside, does tricks (on some days) and knows his way to the park. He’s friendly with other dogs on the street but barely walks- he’s incredibly slow and has trouble turning corners. I can see his legs shaking but if I pick him up, he’ll bark loudly in my arms and try his best to bite me. 

At night, he lays in bed and barks as if someone is there when I’m in the other room. I try to calm him down but he threatens to attack me so I just try to leave him alone. He also stopped letting my boyfriend get near him even though he’s been in his life since he was a puppy. 

I took him to the vet, he thinks the sudden aggression is to do with pain, arthritis and cognitive decline. He mentioned the main signs of dementia are things like house soiling, pacing, forgetting where his dish his but he doesn’t do any of those things. 
Instead, he just has a total change of character- more aggressive, reactive, doesn’t want to be touched/looked at. 

All of my friends think it’s time to euthanize him because he’s a completely different dog than he was a year ago, but I’m honestly not sure if this is a case of negative conditioning from his past treatment or if he is seriously confused/in pain. 

If you could please let me know your thoughts/experiences with senior dogs with CCD I would greatly appreciate it. 

I don’t want to euthanize a healthy dog that is just upset, but I also don’t want to make him live in pain if that’s the case. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1e6lvt5/how_did_you_know_when_your_dog_got_dementia/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,My dog started pacing and barking all night at nothing and has sundowners. Got stuck behind the bedroom and bathroom doors. Has peed where she normally wouldn’t go. She’s on some medication for her dementia. On bad nights when she just won’t settle down the vet prescribed trazodone.,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1e6lvt5/how_did_you_know_when_your_dog_got_dementia/#ldu1m9j,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Our 13.5 yo Cavalier King Charles started pacing all around the house. He then became reactive when I tried to pet him or clean his face baring his teeth and growling. He would keep growling even after I walked away from him. He seemed stiff and it was hard for him to get up from his bed. His appetite changed and feedings have become a challenge. This all seemed to happen from one day to the next. 

We took him to the vet and he was diagnosed with doggie dementia. He’s now on trazodone and gabapentin. He’s a lot calmer and the pacing in the middle of the night has stopped. We thought it would knock him out but I guess it doesn’t when they really need it. We had tried hemp and cbd but it didn’t work. 

On the positive side, we have two min pins and he doesn’t bother them. He’s not waking us up in the middle of the night to go outside. Most importantly, we’ve found that we need to be consistent with the meds and we see the old Rocco instead of Cujo. Don’t lose hope. Our pets are like us as we get older and we sometimes need a little extra help.

,"I remember your post from a few days ago and I mentioned CBD oil for your dog and to ignore people saying to put him down.  From what you describe, it can be dementia/CCD.  There are many symptoms of it, and I thought you said your vet ruled out physical issues and pain.  My one dog with CCD did get aggressive with certain people, which was completely out of character for him.  Other symptoms followed gradually.  They don't develop all the symptoms at once.  My last girl had the pacing and anxiety but never sundowning like one of my other dogs- he had sundowning bad.  Give the CBD a go and avoid the typical meds vets prescribe, because the side effects aren't worth it.  See if it helps.  I'm happy to give you brands and dosage if you want to message me privately.  You should consult with a vet first before giving anything though.

She stopped recognizing the people that cared for her.  She did not want to be cuddled or sit in my lap. She was uncomfortable and not herself.  She was a shadow of her former dogginess. That is when we knew we had to say goodbye.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1e6lvt5/how_did_you_know_when_your_dog_got_dementia/#ldyi2do,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"My 16 year old chi-mix also has dementia and I've been watching its progression for about 1-1.25 years now. Now, this is 1-1.25 years from when she really started showing clearer dementia symptoms (starting to whimper for no reason, starting to pace a bit aimlessly, neurological weakness in her hind legs, being unsettled more). However, even before that, the subtle symptoms  began around 2 years ago (age 13-14 or so). Those symptoms are like your Pom's current symptoms. My sweet girl, who used to let us carry her around like a baby in our arms, and who used to be excited to meet every single stranger she came across (when younger she worked as a therapy dog visiting patients in long term elderly care) , started showing aggression to my spouse and I. She would growl when we approached her face for snuggles, occasionally bite us, starting forgetting her tricks (she used to know a ton), stopped wanting to be handled as much yet was still clingy, starting walking past our house and not recognizing it, spent more time by herself etc. It was a change in character that we initially chalked up to old age or slight body pains. At that time, we got her x-rayed, full body examined, blood panel, etc and she had a clean bill of health so we knew her change in demeanor was not due to pain at that moment. But 2 years later, now today, our girl is very deep and clearly into the late stages of dementia. She now walks in circles, gets stuck behind furniture, can no longer solve food puzzles shes had her whole life and used to previously crush with ease, doesnt seek our attention, and seemingly has lost her volition/intent in her actions...shes almost like a passenger in her own body and no longer in control...I've been accepting that her time with us is coming to end. 

I wish I had recognized her symptoms earlier, when they first began. It was only about 1 year ago when my vet and I started coming up with a gameplan in terms of supplements/treatment/medication to help slow the dementia down. CCD will 100 percent progress in its severity, but the rate of which may be slowed if you take action. Even so, while we had managed her dementia well for the last 6 months, it still took a sudden turn for the worse this last week, even though we have continued the same program. Its the unfortunate nature of this terrible disease. 

My advice for u is to ensure that you are treating all the possible causations that are possibly due to pain (make sure her dental is good, and that she has treatment for arthritis if she has that, have her ears examined for infections etc), and if that doesn't change your dogs demeanor, you should start thinking about dementia as the causation. If your vet is not familiar with CCD, and many are not, change vets. Many vets just think its anxiety, and prescribe meds for those symptoms. I had to find a vet that understood CCD and that would prescribe me Anipryl/Selegeline, which is the only FDA approved drug to treat CCD in dogs. Our girl is also on senilife supplement.  That being said, the most helpful for us has been the introduction of Gabapentin, which both calms her anxiety and helps with pain  If you want a great resource on this topic, considering reading Eileen Anderson's book ""Remember Me.""  It consolidates a lot of info about dementia in dogs. My vet also provided me with great summary about other potential  drugs/supps that we should try throughout this journey. DM me and I'll forward to you. 

The tough part about dogs at this age is that there are often comorbidities. Their vision can be getting worse, there hearing is diminishing, and in turn that also affects their ability to interact with the environment and keep their brain stimulated and strong. My girl got worse as she became more deaf, and more recently her vision has gotten worse which also seems to have made her symptoms worse. She started having more accidents in the house, not only because of her dementia, but also because she started showing signs of kidney disease at age 15.  If you can, try to keep your dog engaged with exercise, training, or some other mental stimulation, to the extent that she is comfortable doing so...studies show that dogs on dementia meds do even better when they have exercise/stimulation. Lastly, please baby proof their environment. Consider putting down yoga mats for traction throughout the house.  As dogs progress in dementia, they started doing wild Sh\*t they never would have done before. My girl who used to train agility, would now face plant jumping off sidewalk curbs because she couldn't judge distance anymore. She also zoomied straight into a wall the other day.  My first dog that had dementia who passed 4 years ago, jumped through the rungs of our 2nd story railing, he survived but it clearly was not good for him.  Lastly, be patient with your pup and yourself and dont be too hard on yourself. Realize that none of the things your dog is doing, is out of spite or within their control, and realize that there will be bumps along the way and that you are doing the best you can to control the things within your reach.

He is otherwise happy & mostly healthy. He has mild arthritis in one of his back legs/hip. We’ve noticed he gets a bit grumpier with his little brother (2 year old Labrador) more easily as well. 

Our vet has advised that realistically he will have maybe another year or two with us and basically told us when he deteriorates it’s better to let him go sooner rather than later so he isn’t in pain and a state of constant confusion. How do we know when that time is? Is it something we will just know when we are there?

,"Our Chihuahua lived about 4 years with dementia, 2 years severe. Near the end, he was extremely food-obsessed, completely primal, and didn't intentionally interact with us, although he loved cuddles, which he got lots of! He stopped barking, whining, etc, early on. Near the end, he often walked around in circles, obsessively sniffing the ground (probably looking for food), but never ran. He always found the food and water bowls! He also went completely blind and deaf. We allowed him to eat as much as he wanted at the end and cleaned up his poop as it fell from his bum, which he would immediately eat if we didn't get to it first.

The day he passed, he had multiple painless seizures, one where he barked playfully and ran his little legs like a puppy, obviously transported to his youth. After the completely silent years prior, it was the most moving and odd thing to experience. We decided it was time, and he died peacefully in our arms at 19.

Hindsight is 20/20, and we wonder if we should have put him down sooner. He almost always had someone with him, so we had the luxury to give him everything he needed, a lot of constant work and supervision.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ilaxad/dementia_in_dogs/#mbtwevb,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Our girl, Pip, started developing CCD in 2020.  We tried Aktivait and Senilife, CBD oil and golden paste.  Absolutely nothing stopped slowed or eased her symptoms but she also had Cushings and arthritis and was on many medications that perhaps altered the effects.  We sent her over the Rainbow Bridge in 29/04/2022 and i kept her too long.

The last nine months were awful.  She slept all day and was up all night and would walk herself into a corner where a nightlight was and just stare at it.  If she fell out of bed she’d scream until we got to her.  One of us slept on the sofa to be close to her but we didn’t really sleep because we were always listening out.  She lost control of her bowels.  

Euthanasia isn’t “killing your dog” like someone else commented.  It’s not allowing your pet that’s loved you and given you it’s whole happiness to exist in pain, fear and confusion until they don’t even know you.

,"Unfortunately,  yes. Our dachshund, Sadie, started showing signs of dementia at around 12 years old. We didn't know dogs could get it. 

It started with her just stopping in the middle of the room and gazing at nothing that we could tell. It gradually got worse. She would get lost around the house. I would find her facing a corner, just staring at it. We have a large, fenced-in back yard that she knew by heart. She started getting lost out there, but couldn't find her way back to the house. Her eyesight wasn't the problem. 

She was pretty much healthy otherwise. It got to the point that she was lucid for about an hour in the morning. Because of the meds the vet had her on and the declining disease, she slept the rest of the day/night. She did still eat her dinner.

I was a nervous wreck! I continually worried about where she was when she was awake and spent many, many hours holding her as she slept.

Oh Molly
You have been with me through so much...Recovering from intense surgeries, bone marrow biopsies, collapsed lungs, strokes, an abusive relationship, faith crisis, multiple bouts of sepsis, suicidal ideation, kidney transplant, grief, loss of loved ones and so much more. You've not only helped me, but every member of our family through some of the hardest times in our lives. 

You always found a way to make us laugh with your goofy antics. 
You showed me love when I didn't believe I was deserving of it. 
You were my constant shadow and confidant. 
You were the reason I got up most days. 
You saved my life, time and time again. 

15 years and 7 months is a long time... But I selfishly wish we had more time together. I use to roll my eyes at people who called themselves ""dog moms"", but you were the closest thing to a child that I'll ever have in this life.

Just like you've loved every version of me, I have loved every version of you. Even this last one, as hard as it's been, struggling with doggy dementia, severe arthritis, pain and health issues. But I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

The unconditional love you've shown me is a gift I'll forever be grateful for. I feel incredibly lucky to have known and felt this kind of love.

However let it be a comfort to you that the pain will turn into great memories of lessons given to you by your dog; lessons about love, loyalty, happiness, forgiveness, courage, humbleness, and zest for life and most importantly about yourself. I believe that dogs are God’s gift which he gave us so that we have a chance to learn these lessons from them. They are also here to give us comfort and encouragement when we are down. Thus our dogs are not just our guardians, but most importantly they are our teachers. And when their dog’s job is done, then they have to go to doggie heaven back to God. The pain we feel when the dog goes young or old is so great, I know. However, it is only a bargain tuition which we pay for these great lessons, protection and happiness the dog so generously and selflessly gave us.

Cherish these lessons and remember that your dog is not buried in the woods under a tree or in the desert or in the urn, but please know that your dog is buried in your heart where he will live in your memories as long as you do. Anytime you want your dog, he will jump smiling from the tall grass and remind you of the happy times which you have had together and will have forever. Be grateful for it.”",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fpm9hh/said_goodbye_to_my_best_friend_i_feel_like_im/#loz9rhm,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It's not goodbye .. it's see ya later
I lost my 17 year old best senior boy Boston terrier Toby Thursday unexpectedly after a choking incident that I don't think I'll ever recover from witnessing or not blame myself for. He'd had other health issues like seizures, dementia, leg weakness, and likely lung cancer that we were informed about very recently.

We adopted him when he was already 12. He was my first dog. I had to wait 33 years to finally get a dog and I absolutely hit the jackpot with him. I remember walking past his kennel at the shelter listening to people complaining about not seeing any puppies and he poked his head out from under a blanket at the exact moment I walked by. He knew we were gonna be his people. When we brought him home he took a few steps and then kind of had a reaction like he realized this was all his and he was home and started running around happy. He was my Velcro dog. Loved my husband, but he literally had to know where I was at all times and spent all his time with me. I work from home so I spent all of my time with him. We would take naps on the couch together. Even now as I lay on the couch like muscle memory my legs are shifted to the side a bit to make room for him so snooze against my legs. 

I'm struggling so much with seeing everything around the house reminding me of him. I had to put the playpen away where he'd hang out most of the time towards the end because he would wander with weak back legs and in there he would atleast get comfy and nap. It was too hard to see it empty. He was my best friend. I miss him so much it hurts. 5 years wasn't enough. I don't know how to be without him in this quiet house without his old man snoring and snorting softly in the background of everything. 

He truly was the best little old man in the world and I miss him terribly. See you later, my Toby, Toby-obi-obi, Toby Toberson Attorney at Law, Bud, Baby Boy, Cool Toby, Lil Teef

,"The thing about him having a difficult passing really resonates. My sweet old girl passed away in November in what I can only describe as an unjust and cruel manner. I’m haunted by memories of it every day. So I get it, I really do. It just doesn’t make sense for these innocent, good, and beautiful little lives to end in such heartless and difficult ways. 

I of course feel sad for everyone who posts about putting their dog to sleep. But I also feel jealous that they were able to have peaceful experiences with death. And the guilt I feel for not being able to provide my girl with the same thing has eaten me raw. 

Anyway, I read your post and wanted to take a moment to validate your sorrow, regret, guilt, and perhaps trauma. The emotional pain that comes from witnessing your heart dog die like this is extraordinary and real and profound. It’s very hard to get past it all.

 Hugs my humans I am sitting here at the Rainbow Bridge. I don't want you to worry about me. There are other dogs and cats here with me. I know Mom was worried that I would be warm enough, she always was a worrier, but the weather here is bright and sunny. I am missing my ball. I did find a whole bunch of toys so I think I will find something to play with. It is so nice here grass, creeks, ponds, and lakes. Trees and bushes birds flying all around and we don't have to worry about ever being picked on. I just met a Collie named Jack and he is taking me around to meet the others. Even the cats are friendly. Scarlet is a gray kitty and she showed me where the treats were, she even took a nap with me. Please don't get me wrong I miss you all and one day we will meet again at the Rainbow Bridge until we do, don't worry about me. Until we meet again thank you for giving me a life I truly enjoyed. I hope that I gave you many good times also. So until that day comes I will be waiting for you at the Rainbow Bridge.

"My dog is turning 16 in a few months. He is blind, deaf and has dementia. What should I do that’s best for him?
The only way he’s navigating is through smell, he bumps into walls numerous times a day, only likes walks for a couple of minutes of the day, and defecates everywhere multiple times a day. He paces around a lot, doesn’t know where he’s going and gets stuck in corners a lot. Today he was stuck in a corner and was crying for me to help, it really was a sad thing for me to witness. I have never heard him cry like that before, he sounded so helpless and lost. 

He still eats well, physically still ok (he still gets zoomies but with no sense of direction) but I don’t know if he is happy anymore. The only time I see him at peace is when he’s sleeping. I thought of putting him down but my mom made it like such an evil thing to do. I shook it off after a while, then came across a thread that said “But extra life no matter what is not always the kindest choice, if that life barely contains anything enjoyable.” and now I am rethinking things. 

Keep note that I have to travel a lot and most of the people in the house don’t care too much for him other than feeding and cleaning him. Do you think it’s best to send him off in my arms rather than wait for his body to fail him? 

Will the vet judge me for doing this as on the outside he still seems relatively healthy? ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1eo6hnu/my_dog_is_turning_16_in_a_few_months_he_is_blind/,,,,,,,,,,,,

For me, when my gal lost the things that made her ""her"", that was when I made the decision. For example, she was always unbelievably prissy clean and dedicated to only going potty outside. Eventually we were going through about 10+ potty pads a day and she had just started whimpering during her baths.

She passed at 17yrs and 4 months, unbelievably healthy except for her cancer which was hemangiosarcoma. I'm proud to say that I did everything in my power to keep her as ""her"" all the way until her last week. For me, when I made the selfless decision to help her cross over, it was to allow her the freedom to go back to smelling good, being prissy and always going potty in the best spots.

My dog goes to sleep in the comfort of his own home; my other dogs were able to see the passing so they had closure; last, but not least, I don’t feel guilty about blubbering like an idiot on the floor for an hour.  

It’s one of the hardest choices you can make, but if you truly believe your dog’s quality of life has diminished greatly, please consider doing the humane thing and letting them go. 

Spoil them on their last day. Go on one last little trip for them, if that’s their thing. Maybe not a walk if they’re not up for it, but I’ve driven my dogs to the park and the river before they’re passing. Home-cooked meals like hamburger, chicken, whatever. One of my dogs liked tuna, so that’s what he got. And all of them had chocolate shortly before they’re passing favorite toys, and favorite toys and blankets around them, it’s sometimes the best we can do for them.

,"I had the same dilemma a mere 9 days ago.  We want to believe our babies will live forever…or they’ll peacefully pass in their sleep.  I watched my beautiful, fun almost 18 yo doxie become blind, deaf, dementia ridden, fighting off infections, having to be given so many pills & shots, etc.  His body just could do no more - and I was so afraid his end would come cruelly.  I was afraid he’d struggle to breath, struggle to eat/drink, just plain struggle…I couldn’t do it to him.

It is the hardest decision I ever had to make.  And it hurts like nothing before.

But what has given me some solace is looking at his old pictures and videos (over a thousand).  I saw what he once was - how we laughed so hard at his antics, his intelligence, his strong physicality.  Then I looked at the last pic I took of him when I made the decision.  Although I miss him sleeping next to me, crying to me, and his dry kisses, I know he’s okay now, being spoiled by my mom and meeting the other babies whose owners are in this community- they’re eating steaks, guys!

You make the decision, don’t let anyone guilt you into doing something you’re not ready to do.  Our vet was fabulous and yours will not judge you at all.

"Dog with Dementia
My dog of 18 years, Abby, has just been diagnosed wtih dementia. The vet said she expects Abby to pass in the next 6 months or so, in her sleep.  Now she is getting caught in furniture and at times being unable to get herself out of a corner and it's breaking my heart.  I am like, ugly crying, because she got caught in the bed rail (that i put on for her because she keeps falling off the bed) and wasn't able to get free.  My heart is breaking.  When do I know it's time to let her go?

It was over a year from diagnosis, can't recall the exact timeline, but we finally acted (waited too long we all agree) when he grew weak and couldn't really support himself going outside and was just unfortunately a living shell.  My MIL came for our son's graduation and was shocked at his appearance.  She kindly told us we should say goodbye.  It is easy to let this condition go too long because unless there is some other disease at work, they don't really suffer in the traditional sense with outward signs of pain.

,"18 years is incredible.  Abby looks so sweet.  I've had dogs with CCD live a couple of years with it and it was something else that they ended up passing away from.  I've never had a dog pass peacefully in their sleep.  My last girl with CCD was having really bad symptoms.  Our traditional vet was no help, but we consulted a holistic vet.  She recommended and guided us with CBD oil.  That stopped all of our girl's symptoms.  You can always consult a holistic vet too and try some natural ways to help Abby.  CCD is manageable.  For when she gets stuck in corners and furniture, you can take away those places.  We used throw pillows and bubble wrap.  Take away the corners.  They make bed rails that are mesh and solid- nothing for her to get stuck in.  

As for when to let Abby go, I’ve put together a page specifically to support people in moments like these, with resources and articles that might offer some guidance.  There's no agenda or promotion- just heartfelt information I hope can help.  If you scroll to the bottom, you’ll find some articles that may bring clarity and comfort.

,"This is so hard, and I’m so sorry you’re going through this. My dementia doggie passed away last year, and we struggled with the same thing. Falling off of the couch, getting stuck in corners, generally acting very confused and fearful. There was no magic moment for us — one day we just “knew” that we didn’t want him to live like this anymore. We knew that his moments of happiness had diminished down to almost nothing, and that most of his waking minutes were spent confused or in fear. 

And on the selfish side, it was becoming very hard for me to keep waking up with him every hour or two throughout the night (he would wake up and just start wandering around the bedroom. And even though we’d made the room safe for him, I still couldn’t just lie there listening to him walking around in the dark, knowing he was confused). 

Deciding to let him go was the hardest decision I’ve ever made. My heart is still so empty without him, and the grief is still very palpable. But I know that he wasn’t enjoying life anymore, and that keeping him with me was for my own happiness, not his. 

I wish you the best of luck, and peace in your decision. Make the most of the time you have left with her, and spend every moment you can making her feel loved. ",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gorjhp/dog_with_dementia/#lwmjv7v,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I think the anticipatory grief is hard, especially when you’re experiencing something like dementia where you can see them decline while they remain physically fine (for the most part). 

We are about to go through this with our 15 year old with dementia and as sad as we are going to be, I think we’re expecting to be relieved. Not just for ourselves but for him, because he finds no joy in life or us anymore and he’s so confused and aimless when he isn’t sleeping. All that to say, it will be hard, but the dementia experience eases you into it because it isn’t a sudden medical emergency or pain they experience. At the end of it, I think and hope you’ll find comfort in gifting him the ability to rest. 

The other silver lining to the slow progression is that you know what’s coming, you can take this time to spoil him and check off that bucket list. You have time and the hindsight to do those things when a lot of people might get a week or a day before something happens where they have to make the call. 

Also, no dog will ever replace him. But I think when you are ready you will find that any dog you welcome into your life next will still be just as special.

There are two supportive Facebook groups you may want to join: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/CanineCognitiveDysfunction](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CanineCognitiveDysfunction) and [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1273930059288831](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1273930059288831)  I’ve been through this with two of my own dogs, and I know how challenging it can be.  Years ago, there weren’t many treatment options, and vets had little understanding of the condition. Thankfully, that has changed a little (there's still a long way to go) and there are now specialists and holistic vets who are more knowledgeable.

It was actually a holistic vet who helped us tremendously with our last girl.  We used CBD oil under her guidance, and it stopped all the distressing symptoms like pacing, panting, whining, spinning, and sundowning.  There are other supplements and even medications available, though I would suggest trying natural options first if possible.  While there’s no specific test for CCD, your vet can help rule out other causes.  

CCD is manageable and doesn’t have to be a death sentence.  We were able to get an extra, symptom-free year with our girl, and I hope you’re able to find the right approach for Harley too.

,"Sending you so much love.

My beautiful Daisy had Canine dog dementia hers was rapid on set and it was heartbreaking. It was little things we noticed to start with like pacing and she couldn't settle throughout the day, then she would go into the garden and would just stand there as if to say ""why am I out here?"", then her pacing turned into 22 hours a day and it was full on circling and we would try and break it by holding her to calm her but as soon as we released her from a cuddle she would start her circles again. My other two spaniels would help her regularly with guiding her or settling her as much as they could when she was stressed with the pacing or needed help down to the garden or back they also took her under their paw. We would often help carry her to and from the garden as well so she didn't have to struggle

She sadly lost continence and couldn't find her dinner bowl so we would hand feed her at the end. We could tell in her eyes she was tired and had enough. When we had to make that decision it was the hardest thing we had to do but we knew it was the right one for her.

My vet agreed it was time at the end and also said he thinks she had a brain tumour as well sadly but she wouldn't have survived any treatment so we didn't investigate the possibility of this.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gbjc5x/dog_dementia/#ltnhep8,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Our 15 year old Aussie has arthritis and dementia. She is also almost completely deaf and has trouble seeing in the dark. The hearing and vision loss are due to age. 

We tried a lot of different things but what has worked the best for her is fish oil, a good joint supplement and we loosened the rules on her diet. She is not overweight so if she wants an extra piece of freeze dried beef tripe she gets it. We also make all her meals (kibble) with broth. She has no issues eating but she loves it. 

For pain we use carprofen twice per day and we finished the loading month of adequan injections which we have been very happy with. At night she takes Xanax because she does get anxious and this helps her a lot. 

We just added in CBD and we give this to her on days when she seems more uncomfortable. We went with Ellevet CBD because they are third party tested and they have done clinical trials. 

We also make sure she gets daily walks. They are sniff walks so it is a lot of mental stimulation. She has become very aware and nervous when she cannot find me in the house so we use hand signals - your guy can hear so maybe try commands - to let her know what is happening. 

We talked to our vet at length about medication and she flat told us that using medications for dementia is the same as using medications for diabetes - it’s necessary. The Xanax at night changed her life during the day. She slept better and was able to participate happily in walks and we could tell she was less anxious.

,"Sending comfort and love! I’m so sorry you’re going through this. 

My senior pup recently started to showed signs of dog dementia as well and the vet confirmed this. He also came to us a few years ago with one eye that was going blind, which eventually became fully non-functional (and is shrinking, which is interesting). He very recently fully lost vision in his “good” eye, making him totally blind. For what it’s worth, he’s doing fine in that regard and can still navigate his way around 3 different homes he became familiar with while still having partial vision, as well as two outdoor areas for walks. Otherwise, in new areas, he sometimes is slow and sniffs around a lot, as well as sometimes walks into / off of things, but we are just careful. It’s of course a bit harder to guide a big dog like yours but it can be done. 

The confusion your dog is feeling will likely fade as he navigates the world with his new symptoms. He’s probably under a decent amount of distress, as you suspect, but dogs are super adaptable. All we can do is try to stay strong for them. You can do things like “baby-proof” your house so pointed edges or sharp corners in areas he often traverses are covered or even moved, so he has a clearer path. If he’s whining, perhaps try a calming chew or even talking to the vet about anxiety meds? My dog seemed to do well with CBD calming chews from the pet store. 

Best of luck! You got this. Remember dogs are strong and smart. He may be stressed now as these changes start occurring but he will likely adapt, especially with some help.

Edit to add: Mine also doesn’t get visibly stressed anymore due to losing his vision, and tbh, his dementia symptoms faded though they were initially mostly present in the evening. This may be due to other health factors but I like to think perhaps it was a phase or perhaps he adapted.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gbjc5x/dog_dementia/#ltok9hg,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Dog dementia, arthritis and euthanasia 
My chihuahua mix is 14 and a half years old, I've had him for 10 years and he's truly the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love him so much. The past year and a half has really been hard for him as he has developed arthritis I believe and dementia. He's gone downhill really quickly. Although he is this way, he's not on any medication as my vets never felt like it was any concern. Yesterday he took a turn for the worst and was displaying concerning behavior so I rushed him to the vet and they assessed his quality of life and by their opinion think it's time for him to go. I have been thinking about this for a while as he no longer enjoys anything he does, can barely see or hear, and has anxiety and sundowning. He still seems to want to live and I can't bare with the idea that I would be the one taking that from him. I guess I'm just looking for any sort of advice on navigating when it feels like time, and if anyone has had a dog with similar symptoms which got better with medication. I would hate to put him down if all he needs is some meds. This is the hardest thing I've gone through.

He’s walking again, playing and his mood has improved substantially. As for the dementia, I have seen lots of people on here whose vet treats that with medication as well. I don’t know personally but a lot of people post about it. I would consider seeing a new vet honestly. It’s strange to me they haven’t offered solutions. I would try medication before putting your baby down. Hopefully others will chime in with their experience but consider a new vet.

,"My dog (15, also a chihuahua mix) has similar symptoms and she's on the max dose of pain meds 24 hours a day. They help some but not as much as I'd like. She has some heart and kidney issues that have been well managed, but the back pain and dementia are the things I can't seem to help her with. Yesterday I had a long talk with the vet and they recommended that I put my dog down sometime in the next 6 months, because she's kind of okay for now, but her condition is only going to get progressively worse, and her quality of life is declining. They told me that by doing that, I can avoid the terrible suffering in her final days that could potentially come about as a result of some kind of catastrophic event like rupturing a disc in her back. I mentioned that I would be moving in about a month, and the vet told me I should seriously consider putting my dog down before moving because it's just not necessary to put her through that stress. Honestly, I agree, even though it will be the hardest thing I ever do.

What you described sounds really similar to what my dog is going through. If you're not satisfied and you feel that you need to try harder for him before he goes, maybe you should get a second opinion from another vet. Maybe they will want to try pain meds. But pain meds (I can tell you from experience) won't stop the sundowning symptoms, are often only partially effective against pain, and very likely won't help bring your boy's quality of life back given that the dementia, deafness, and blindness are already isolating him from the world, and he's not very happy. Keep in mind that physical pain is only one part of the equation - mental pain like anxiety, fear, isolation, confusion, etc are all a form of suffering for animals, too.

Obviously I can't tell you what's best for your dog, but I figured I can share some recent similar experience and maybe this will help you feel at peace with whatever hard decisions you need to make.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fjtbqj/dog_dementia_arthritis_and_euthanasia/#lnqh7lc,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I have fostered and adopted many senior chis over the years and have been in a similar position a few times.  The situation with my super senior girl was bleak.  She had arthritis and very bad dementia symptoms.  She was blind and deaf when I got her.  We were considering euthanasia, but I figured I'd reach out to her holistic vet about it first.  Her general vet was no help.  The holistic vet recommended CBD oil and guided us with using it.  Once we figured out the dosage it completely stopped all of our girl's symptoms (panting, sundowning, pacing, spinning in circles until she fell over).  A side effect of CBD is it decreases inflammation, so it also ended up easing her arthritis.  It was like a miracle in a bottle for her and it gave us one more year with her symptom free.  She passed about 2 months ago and I've been trying to help other chi parents since.  If you have a holistic vet you can take your boy too, I would recommend it.  If you want any guidance with the CBD oil, don't hesitate to message me.  I'm happy to go over brands and how to give it.  It can be tricky and there are so many fake brands out there.  (I should mention at one point about 5 or 6 months before my girl passed, she completely lost mobility in her hind legs.  CBD can only do so much and it was more for the CCD/dementia.  We had to add prednisone to the CBD, and the pred gave her full mobility back.

"Canine dog dementia 
Hiya my springer also has canine dog dementia. She is 16 and it's beyond heartbreaking. She circles continuously when she doesn't circle she needs constant supervision or she sleeps. 
To the parents of other CDD have your beautiful babies tried eating their dinner bowls at all?  My beautiful girl tries to eat hers after her meals each day today she nearly fell asleep in the water bowl. We have two other dogs her little rescue sisters who try to help her in terms of stopping her from circling or with helping her to find her way down the garden.

I think my question is when do you ""when is it that dreaded time"" it's beyond heartbreaking because we lost two of our previous girls over the last two years as well so knowing that we've lost three dogs in three years is so hard but we would never keep her going just for us because we always do what's best for them.

We've never had to deal with CDD before so this is a new one on us. In the past with all our previous dogs we had the normal issues such as the back legs and hips going which impacted them so much that they couldn't carry on and then one had incurable cancer so we knew we were on borrowed time with her anyway but the CDD it's so hard because she's like a dimming candle and she isn't how she was even a month ago and just writing this I'm in floods of tears.

"Older dog had anesthesia, now suddenly has dementia symptoms
We have an 18-year-old Bichon poodle mix who has a recent history of seizures and has been on Keppra for a couple months now. When he was initially loaded on Keppra he was kind of stumbly and confused as expected, but symptoms steadily resolved over a week and then he was back to his normal self. The cause of his seizures is unknown because we declined putting him through an MRI. 

Recently at the advice of some of our vets he went under sedation with butorphenol and midazolam to remove a growth from his ear canal. The concern was it would keep growing and eventually completely clog his ear canal and cause other issues. The plan and medications were reviewed by his neurologist, cardiologist, and dermatologist. Ever since his surgery 4 days ago he’s had a change in his behavior with dementia symptoms (circling, getting stuck in corners, and sundowning all night with great difficulty going to bed and staying in bed). We have tried our best to keep him in a routine with regular meals, walks, etc. We have given him CBD at night which previously helped keep him calm all night and not needing to get up, but doesn’t seem to be working or now he is trying to fight through its effects. I’m not sure what exactly is going on or if there is anything else we can try doing. We are meeting with his neurologist tomorrow to reassess him, but any additional information or advice from those who may have experienced this is appreciated. 

We’re worried something happened from the medications from his surgery and this is just how he is now. We feel awful, it’s hard to not blame yourself.

"My dog has dementia/ sundown. What do I do now?
Long post fair warning! 

We went to the ER Vet around 10:45pm last night because we were concerned about my 17-21 year old papillon. The last few days he’s been bumping into things he shouldn’t be and getting disoriented. I was afraid it was neurological as a previous pet had also died of a brain tumor and behaved similarly.

 So we hurried to the vet. After a while the vet came out and said aside from an elevated temperature they could find nothing physically wrong and gave him subcutaneous fluids. 

When I received him back he seemed like my normal sweat old boy. He was alert and seemed to recognize everyone. Even my mom who came to support us. 

Now it’s 6:30 am and I found him standing between me and my husband. Not terribly unusual as he normally gets our attention so we can get him off the bed if he needs to potty. We have a captains bed so it’s pretty high off the ground and he can’t really jump down.

I ask my husband if he could take him to potty and he told me he’d tried two times already and he just bumped around the living room, but did still take him to try again. 

I got up as I wanted to confirm our primary vet visit this Monday and watched him. He did pee on his pad and then proceeded to walk in a kind of circle and start bumping into things he normally wouldn’t. The guitar stand, the kitchen table leg, the pet stairs to the couch. Things that we don’t move so even blind he should know. 

We are now back in bed and it took him about 20-30min of him standing, laying, standing, laying ect. And he finally seems to be sleeping now. 

I’ve never had a pet who was so old they developed dementia and Sun downing. As the vet said he’s in no physical distress. No pain, no heart problems, liver and kidneys are all good. No normal quality of life issues. But I don’t know what to do and how to support my old man! What would you suggest? 

TLDR: how do you help a dog with dementia and Sun downing?

Edit: unfortunately we had to go to the vet and he told me if it was his dog, it would be time. We already knew it was coming but it still wasn’t easy. Said good buy about 30min ago. I wasn’t ready then and I’m still not now. But he was. And he went from being in my arms to into my heart.

,"I went through this with my senior dog. Keep in mind that wandering isn’t inherently bad. A high level of agitation and wandering is what you want to avoid. 

Stick to your regular schedule. If you usually sleep with him in your bedroom and have the door closed, keep doing that. If the bedroom door is usually open, try sleeping with it closed. If that upsets him too much, leave the door open and let him wander. 

You know how people baby proof a house? Dog proof your house. Look at it and say, if he’s wandering around, are there stairs he can fall down? Is there pottery that will fall on him if he bumps into a shelf or table? Just dog proof it. Keep in mind that bumping into things is truly not the end of the world. If it really bothers you, use foam mattress material to create “bumpers” on furniture. Do not rearrange the furniture. That will make it harder for him. Use baby gates as needed. 

Make your bedroom “home”. Have a soft, dim nightlight on in your room or close to the door of the room, so he can see “home” at night. If it won’t bother you, and your dog can still hear, play a soothing soundtrack on your phone or tablet for the night. I would play “Forest Sounds No Loop” on YouTube. Then my dog could hear “home” at night. 

I also added a bed for her in the living room, so if she wandered there but decided to lie down, she had a bed there too. 

She still wandered, but was less agitated, often found her way “home” during the night, and I was still able to get some sleep. Of course I checked on her when I got up to use the bathroom, and often she would follow me back to bed. 

If she was very agitated, I would hear her and would guide her back to the bedroom. In her end days she wanted to be in the living room, so I slept out there with her. 

Melatonin didn’t work for her. She did not tolerate sedative medications and they did not work on her as desired - they actually made her more agitated. 

She did not toilet indoors until very late stages and I used puppy pads. 

Sundowning is something you have to learn to live with.  

She was safe. She was secure. She was confused. But we got through it. You need to sleep to be your best self for your dog and your humans. 

Sundowning could go on for many, many months. Your plan needs to be sustainable. My plan was made in consultation with our vet. 

I wish you well. Pets to your beautiful pup.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1bb3g1w/my_dog_has_dementia_sundown_what_do_i_do_now/#ku788rz,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I'm  so sorry . It's  a frustrating thing for the dog and humans. Prepare to be patient and loving. Mine would stand in corners and get wedged behind furniture and wander with no purpose. 
  If you can keep your dog in an area where they can't have too many things  to bump into or places to wander  around at night it helps. 

For sundowner's my vet said 5 mg of melatonin was allowed. But you need to check with your vet to see if that is ok in your dog's situation. I would give it to my dog at just after sunset/ early dusk do it would kick in. It was not a fix but it helped a bit. Also the dementia med segeline (sp?)  did not help my dog at all. Possibly she  started too late and was too advanced with the canine cognitive disorder.

,"Sorry to hear what you all are going through.  The frequent vet visits, life style changes for everyone in the house, and just slow dissent you have to watch every day.  It’s difficult to really step back and see all of the changes that happen over time as they’re all so gradual.  

We had a house of 4 dogs, all seniors.  We still have our little one Olivia with us but the other three have passed away over the last 8 months.  Our 13 year old greyhound had started having loud barking episodes completely out of nowhere in the middle of the night.  She also lost control of her bowels, which she never had any problems with her whole life.  I could tell there was some dementia or something like it towards the end.  It’s hard to watch unfold, but certainly started getting me into the headspace of it about to be time.  

For all of our dogs we waited until we felt it was time, looking at their behaviors individually for their bodies and heart to let us know.  They will keep showing up for you over and over, it’s your place to make the call when you feel it.  We had in home hospice for all of our pups, definitely was helpful.

,My 16 year old Yorkie mix has early dementia. It’s so sad and heartbreaking. She doesn’t have the sundowners but she would whine and whine after dinner wanting to go outside. So we’d go outside and she may or may not potty then we’d come inside and she’d immediately start whining again to go back outside. It was like she had no recollection of just being outside. She’s on Prozac now which has helped tremendously. We’ve also tried CBD chews which also help but do seem to knock her out. You could ask your vet about an option like that. She’s very easily thrown off - like if we go out of town it takes her a few days to readjust when we return. She also struggles on stairs and has problems getting on the couch and bed. It’s rough.

"Dog dementia- please advise 
I have a jack Russell (13 years) who is my best friend. He has a heart murmur and is on medication which makes him constantly hungry. He also has doggy dementia which started as him being less responsive and sleeping more to now being randomly aggressive. He has stomach issues and has recently been eating stones and cement (from renovation work). His constant hunger has made treats and feeding times more difficult as you barely make it to the ground before he is snapping the food away ( he didn’t used to have these issues, so I believe it’s his medication). He has also started growling and trying to bite on random occasions, like cleaning after walks or when getting too close to him. I try not to push his boundaries but these moments seem to be getting more frequent and I am worried he will end up biting. It seems like he doesn’t recognise me sometimes and this makes him wary or he doesn’t understand what’s happening. 

He is the best boy when he has his good days which is most of the time but I don’t know what to do. He needs his medication and his dementia (I imagine) will only progress. My parents think it is his time but I am really struggling with this. Any advice please? ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1evh5p9/dog_dementia_please_advise/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"My miny mixed mutt Jenny is 19 and has been showing slow progression with doggy dementia for well over a year now. Her vision is pretty dang good overall, lost her hearing about two years ago. She's the kind of dog you take to people who don't like dogs. We always joke that my cat is the dog and my dog is the cat. Jenny came as a ""just watch her for a while"" that never left. 

Jenny isn't on any medications. Her health is great! She paces, she sundowns, she barks at random which is the weird one because she has never barked. We keep an open path for her pacing. We keep the house bright until bedtime to fool her on the time. She ""bites"" now towards being given treats, cutting her nails or getting a bath. She gets a comfort cut twice a year and she won't tolerate being brushed anymore. Her ""biting"" isn't with malice; it's like a toothless baby gnawing on your finger. Sometimes it can be as innocuous as reaching towards her for any reason or as overt as picking her up at a bad time. 

She's mouthy during her moments. It happens when the gaze lasts a little too long, when the pacing increases, when it's time to shut down the house for bed, when she stops and stares at seemingly nothing for a while. It's the only way she can react when she's scared or confused. It sucks and we do everything we can to mitigate the impact by giving her space and time. 

I don't know what it will look like in another month, six months, a year. At nearly 20, we want the rest of her life to be her best life. I've been so affixed on what to do when her body gives out that I forgot that her brain can give out too. It's hard. I don't have any advice, I'm sorry.

The vet also  put him on an anxiety/sleeping med (trazadone) and an antidepressant. He had to wear a belly band cuz he was peeing constantly too. He just kept getting worse and worse. Well after 2 months decided to put him down because the poor guy was shaking and afraid constantly and since the meds weren’t working decided I would stop them till the appointment. Once he stopped the vet meds he improved every day. I realized the meds were making him a wreck. He is sensitive to meds too and even anxiety meds make him worse. Thank god I stopped the meds or I would have lost him. I did try one last med made specifically for dog dementia, Seligiline, after I decided I wasn’t going to put him down but he didn’t do well that that either.

I have noticed a difference in her already in one week which I'm so grateful for. I've researched it and some say it has worked for their dogs and others not so much. A lot may be due to each dog's body chemistry. It also is safe to use with any prescription drugs since the ingredients are all natural.

"I can’t do it. I am too selfish.
Our whole life since November has been being home 24/7 for our almost 16 year old boy Tye. He has arthritis, a bad neck and advanced doggy dementia. He took a bad turn in November with a persistent eye infection, having accidents in the house, and his hind leg mobility. We finally stabilized the gut issues after supplements and changing his feeding schedule. He’s currently on Cognition Bites, Halcion and Senilife for his brain health. Milk Thistle, SamE, Denamarin, Ursodiol for liver support, Antinol and Galiprant for arthritis, Tylan for his poops, and CBD and melatonin for night time. He has gotten laser therapy and acupuncture weekly but we have stopped the last few weeks because I think the sessions are stressing him out.

We haven’t taken a vacation away from the dogs since November 2023. We took everyone to the beach 2 hours away over the summer. I don’t drive. Now If we need groceries, my husband goes and I stay home. Same for any errands. I had a doctor appointment, and we brought him with and he waited in the car with my husband. We have a nanny camera up on his playpen if we have to go to any other room in the house. He can’t be left unattended because he will tip over and can not get himself back up. Flailing could further injure his neck and arthritis so we always have eyes on him! I’m not comfortable asking family or our reliable dog sitter to watch him anymore. Too unknowns with his potty schedule too. 

So far I have read a pet loss grief book, various websites and a lot of your beautiful stories. I called Lap of Love and got all our information on file. My husband, who dearly loves him sees euthanasia as “killing a dog who is not dying of anything”. That is true. He does not have anything terminal but his quality of life is so vastly different than even 1 year ago. He doesn’t wag his tail anymore, doesn’t bark unless he needs something (water, potty, down from when we hold him), can’t hold himself up to go poop. The calcified discs in his neck stop him from holding his head up so his head hangs with his nose sometimes touching the floor. My husband feeds him off a silicone baby spoon, we hold him to drink water from his dish. He sleeps well besides waking up to pee in the middle of the night. He naps comfortably during the day. He enjoys our daily stroller “walks”. 

I’m just at a loss. I don’t want to let him go but secretly and selfishly I’m relieved my husband doesn’t want to let him go either. Tye is the love of my life. He was there to love me unconditionally when I didn’t love myself. He was there for every depressive season and now he’s been here for my highest of highs. Truthfully I am not sure how I will cope with this loss. Is it awful to compare it to losing a child? That’s the only vastness of grief I can imagine it coming close to. I don’t know what I’m looking for. You are all so strong and doing right by your buddy.

,"My husband, who dearly loves him sees euthanasia as “killing a dog who is not dying of anything”.

Totally feel you and understand. This was hard for us. Muppet's anal gland tumor was growing but not yet blocking his ability to poop. His dementia was not quite to the night screams stage. He was forgetful, we had to take him out to potty every two hours.

At the end we had to help hold him up to poop. His back legs were already weak and he was eating less and it was getting harder to poop so he struggled and fell backwards.

All that said. He was happy. He sometimes remembered how to use the doggy door and seemed pleased with himself. He liked treats and while he ate less (lost a pound in a month) he did still eat.

But it was time. My wife and I had to keep telling ourselves. ""There's only one way this goes. worse. He won't get better. It's all downhill. It was a gentle slope but we knew it'd turn steep and likely we woudn't know when.

I nearly left the vet on Muppet's last day when she walked in. Several times I almost called to cancel the appointment. It's so hard. I still feel doubt every time I see a picture of him.

I know it was the best thing for him (and us. It's not selfish. Think of your quality of life too), but that doesn't change the size or shape of the hole in my heart. Totally not crying as I type this.

All I can offer is. Don't extend Tye's suffering to delay yours. It's not fair to him or you. He's had a great life full of love. They rely on us for these things and it hurts, but we have to do it.

,"I am in the exact same spot with my 17 year old. I’m saying goodbye next weekend. 

I can’t tell you what to do, but for me, it became very clear that my dog no longer enjoyed his life. In fact, I fear he is suffering. He eats a little but not much. I can’t reliably medicate him anymore because of his appetite. He sleeps all day. He can’t go up and down the couch or bed ramp like he used to. I have to carry him outside every two hours to do his business. And within the past week, the light has left his eyes. He doesn’t feel well. He’s nauseated. He’s tired, and it’s unfair of me to ask him to keep going just because I selfishly want him to stick around a little longer. 

And the truth is that I feel relieved having made the decision. I’m exhausted. I’ve been caregiving for him for a year. I haven’t slept through the night in at least that long. I can’t leave my house for more than an hour at a time. He wouldn’t want me to have to do all that just to keep him alive and unhappy. Not only that, but very few of us in life get a peaceful passing. Realistically it’s likely that our critters will pass painfully and in fear due to their ailments. And that’s not fair to do to them when we can give them a good death. That’s what euthanasia means - a good death. 

So I share all of this to say - you know your dog best, and only you can decide. But I do hope you can look at it objectively as hard as it is. Your comments about how you’ve had to care for him indicate a diminished quality of life for you both.

,"I was in almost the exact position as you last year. Since 2022 our oldest (who was 14 in 2022) needed round the clock attention so my Husband and I couldn’t leave the house for any length of time together. I was up at all hours with our girl - for potty breaks, feeding her, just holding her and keeping her relaxed. We too had the cameras set up in the house and we rearranged so much of the house to accommodate her blindness and tilted, wobbly walking from vestibular disease. In early 2024 she started to get worse but I just couldn’t come to terms with losing her. My husband knew it was time, but allowed me to make the decision when I was ready. I finally knew when my poor girl was trying to have a poop and she fell over and layed in it. I was so heartbroken for her and just knew it wasn’t fair to her to live like this. She was 16 at this point and gave us so much love. She would still lick our faces when we got close to hers and she would wag her tail and she tried so hard to adapt to her blindness, deafness and then fainting spells. I still don’t even remember making the call to the vet, but I know I did. I felt like I couldn’t breathe for the week leading up to her passing and for weeks after it. But slowly life started to become a little easier for us as we knew our girl was no longer suffering and trying hard for “us”. 
Jump ahead to earlier this month when we had to say goodbye to her younger sister (she was 14.5). My heart is shattered and I cry for both of my girls every single day. Losing both of our girls in the same year was not something I would have ever anticipated and it has been horribly upsetting. But knowing they have been reunited does give me some comfort. You will get through this. It is by far the hardest decision to make and you will question yourself no matter what. But know that there are so many of us that understand exactly what you are feeling now and that at some point the best, most loving thing we can do for our beloved babies is to let them be free from this life and the ailments that hinder them.

,"It really is so hard. We lost our dog last month, at 16 and a half. We were also managing his issues for his last couple of years - arthritis, chronic kidney disease, doggy dementia, vestibular disease, cysts/hot spots that would heal and then return... I bought everything under the sun to keep him as healthy as possible, and me and my family agreed that long as he still had an appetite, and as long as he had energy to walk around with assistance (he took monthly librela shots) that he still had a good quality of life. 

I was struggling through it as well though. He had a few scares in his last years, but he would always make an amazing recovery. Even the vet would tell us he was recovering well for his age. But despite this, I couldn't help but feel like I was being a bad dog owner and keeping him around for our sake... but it was clear to us he still wanted to be here. I would talk to him all the time, tell him that we will always love him and if he needed to go, it was okay. I told him to let us know if he was ever in pain. Maybe we should have made the decision sooner, I'll never know... but I was his primary caretaker and I could see in his eyes he wasn't ready yet. 

Then on New Year's Day, he wouldn't eat anymore, even his favorite Christmas ham, and that was when we knew. I fully believe that he wanted to spend one last Christmas/New Years with us and held on.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ix61in/i_cant_do_it_i_am_too_selfish/#mejyzu3,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I watched my stepdad die a long, agonizing, horrible death from end-stage Parkinson’s. He couldn’t eat or swallow, he was on 10L of oxygen, his entire body was in severe pain. He went through 10 days of this agony before he got relief. Just 2 months before his passing, I had to say goodbye to my senior Golden, the love of my life. He was allowed to peacefully leave this earth & be free of his pain with love & comfort around him. Of course I sobbed & wailed uncontrollably after - but 2 months later after sitting bedside and watching my Pa die a horrific and inhumane death - I was so wishing someone would have allowed him the gift of euthanasia- so he, too, could have left peacefully.

"My 13 yo dog is scheduled to be euthanized in 4 hours. 
The first time I had scheduled it to be done was 2 months ago after he had a bad seizure and a stroke. I canceled because in five days he was showing improvement. 
Since then he has had some kind of event that has lead me to make this decision. Also, he has dementia and sundowners syndrome. If he’s up he’s walking. He just can’t stop especially worse at evening and night.  The trazodone allows him to sleep. The med doesn’t always help when you think it would. Sometimes he walks 5-6 hours nonstop. So he’s either walking or sleeping. He has had 2 knee surgeries in the past year. One leg is particularly weak and I think is somewhat painful also. I give gabapentin for that. After he’s walked awhile his back legs start giving out and he falls repeatedly. It’s heartbreaking as many of you know. He knows who we are and responds to us but the interactions are not like they use to be. I need to know for sure I’m doing the right thing.  We live a long way from emergency services. My fear is I will wait too long and emergency euthanasia will not be available. I’ve heard from some they regretted having put off euthanizing. Waiting till too bad. I don’t want to be that person either I need to hear from y’all. I need to know it’s ok if I go through with this.

,"I put my Sophie to sleep just under a month ago. Some might have considered it too early as she wasn't in a critical decline but having gone through an emergency euthanasia with our other dog, I didn't want to be in the same situation. I could tell she was in pain and that she was simply existing and I didn't want to make her continue like that just to keep me from having to make the hardest decision. On the day she left she had a good day - which made it even harder to know if I was doing the right thing, but in the end we proceeded on schedule.

"How do I know if it's time?
I know this gets asked a lot. My dog is 18 years old. He has dementia and paces all night long and keeps me awake by barking all night. I can't function very well during the day because of it and it's affecting my mental health. Also he can't control his bladder or bowels so he goes in the house so I'm cleaning that up every day as well. He has arthritis in his hips and back legs. When do you know it's time? The only reason why I'm questioning it is because everywhere I google says ""if they're eating and drinking keep them alive"" but i just don't know if that's the right thing to do anymore. And yes I have tried multiple medications from the vet to help. :( oh and since his back legs don't work so well he can't sit and when he goes to lay down he pretty much just flops down. When I leave for work I don't want him going on the carpet so I gate him in the kitchen (he hates the crate) but the kitchen is tile so idk if he even lays down the whole time I'm gone I'm worried he's just standing the whole time or pacing or barking.

,"I'm sure you know your dog best so I'll just let you know what led me to have my girl put to sleep. She couldn't go on walks anymore which she loved the most. Some days she was more selective when it came to eating but would normally eat her meals. She loved pets and snuggling and still sat on my feet. But I knew all that was left was more struggle, more pain, and just asked myself what I was waiting for.

Should I wait until she felt so bad that she had no appetite? Should I wait until it became so hard for her to move that she had accidents in the house and on herself? Was it fair to make her wait until the pain outweighed her desire for pets and cuddles? Until she was too uncomfortable to sleep through the night? I told her we had a few more sleeps and a couple more breakfasts until we could take away her pain.

My girlfriend and I put up our Christmas tree while our best friend lovingly watched us from one of her favorite spots. Then the vet arrived. 

It's almost been a month and I cry everyday. But I'm also thankful that she had two Frosty Paws and slept on my feet that night.

"Dog Dementia or Arthritis - I'm not sure .
I have a dog who is 14 years old and for the past few weeks for the first time ever she has been intermittently barking throughout the night and some times during the day time , for no apparent reason. At the same time over the past few weeks the dog has started walking with a limp on her front leg . Ive looked at posts here and it seems that with a senior dog and barking at night time , it could possibly be due to the onset of dog dementia .

Ive also read that if a dog is suffering from Arthritis , that also could cause intermittent barking for no apparent reason. So looking at my dogs symptoms I'm not sure which condition ( Dog Dementia or Arthritis ) my dog is actually suffering from.

The problem I face is that I live in a rural remote location in Thailand and the nearest vet is a full days travel away and a full days travel back home. 

So I'm now wondering if in the mean time before I make the long journey to see a vet , if theres any option that I could take , by purchasing ( online ) some medication that would help with my dogs possible Two ( Dog dementia or Arthritis ) condition .

  
Any advice or suggestions very welcome

,"I'm sorry you are dealing with this.  I know how difficult it is to see our furbabies with dementia. I'll tell you what I've been telling everyone dealing with doggy dementia.  Try CBD oil.  You have to give the proper dosage though and be consistent with it.  It takes a couple of weeks to see the results.  You also have to get it from a reputable brand. You want the oil, not the treats. You can always add the oil to treats or to your dog's food. CBD tends to be pricey, but it gave me another year with my girl who was having dementia symptoms so bad we were considering euthanizing. It helped her so much, I'm in the process of making a YT video about how much it helped my girl, in hopes it can help other dogs with dementia/CCD.  If you want any guidance about the brand I used for her and her dosage, feel free to message me. The nice part about CBD is it doesn't have negative side effects and it can help other issues too.

,"We are starting to see some signs, I truly feel for you going through this. My boy is a 15yr old lab/pit mix so fairly advanced in age for his breed. Vet has us starting senilife now, I just ordered them today actually. It is so difficult to face but I laid on the floor with him today, told him the story of his life, Nikko's story, my corgi curled up and listened along. It was heart wrenching but also cathartic in a way. Remembering how robust he really was through almost all his life. It put his world in perspective for me. It's getting much much smaller and if he's content then I'm content, we struggled through a short walk tonight to try to hopefully alleviate some sun downing though he has IVDD so not really supposed to walk but I figured better slow and controlled then rampage pacing through tight quarters falling repeatedly. He is peaceful and his old self most of the day still, but signs are there and I have to know in my head and heart that it can be such a rapid decline. I don't want his last day to be his worst day but I also don't want to sell him short on joy and good times with family. For now we monitor and enjoy and try to push the anticipatory grief back, I thought a lot about my grandmother today who passed from complications of Alzheimer's back in 2005, she was able to voice the affects of the disease, the fear, the loss, reliving losses of life, it was so dark, very few good days and even few good hours. I'm deciding now what will be the cutoff if nature doesn't have her way, what will be the set of small things that tips the scale. I think right now it is looking at it as if I was in his shoes, when would I want to go? Id prefer my dignity as intact as possible, to be able to be with those I love (and know who they are) and to not be in physical pain and discomfort that cannot be controlled.

"My 15 year old Maltese. Is he sun downing? Dementia
Hey everyone! Today was the worst day yet for my pup. A few hours ago he started getting antsy and crying/screaming. He’d sit with me for a bit then get up and cry right outside my door. I’d go pick him up and hold him and lay him back next to me and the cycle continued.

This is the first time he’s done this so early in the evening (4pm). He also threw up about an hour after pacing and then was normal and then started the screaming again. The video in his bed is him right now as I’m typing this. I’ve never seen him like this. Usually at night he’ll cry or find him self in the bathroom behind my toilet or under my desk and I’d pick him up and he’d be fine. But this time it’s been a few hours… a few mins later* now he’s calm again—like nothing happened 🙃

It’s very helpful to read all your stories while going through this ❤️❤️ thanks a bunch 🤗🐶🐾

**Vet update:**

I took him to an urgent care vet this morning (different from his primary care) and they said the same things I’ve been told from two different vets. Not much they can do when it’s neurological. They said it could possibly be a brain tumor (neurological and nausea symptoms) but of course they won’t know unless they run tests and scanning, but basically said it is not worth it at his age and would be extremely costly. They said these are symptoms of sundowning and there’s really no treatment other than prescribing trazadone or gabapentin to help him sleep when he has these episodes. They did give him a nausea shot since I mentioned he vomited earlier and they said he’s licking his lips which may be a sign of still feeling nauseous, but that was all. I asked about him being in pain or having arthritis, they felt all over his body and watched him pace the room and said he doesn’t show any signs of such. And they said the screaming and squirming earlier could have been stomach pains after vomiting mixed with the neurological disorder and feeling confused about what’s happening. He’s no longer feeling that way and has been in good spirits ❤️

•	⁠Of course there’s gonna come a time in the future when I have to make a very hard decision, but he is not there yet thankfully. He is still very much able body and healthy and this was likely a weird response to medication 🐾🐾

thank you all for your thoughtfulness, really means a lot ❤️ hope this info is helpful to any other pet owners experiencing anything remotely similar",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1i5bmmg/my_15_year_old_maltese_is_he_sun_downing_dementia/#m82e9yy,,,,,,,,,,,,
,My lil bud did this few months before he died. He was 14 years old. He had never done that before too so I was spooked when he did it the first time. I was asleep and it was maybe 2am and he gave out some scary shrieks and cry’s. I felt so bad for him. I comforted him and he was fine. A month or two later he did it again but not as strong as the first one. Til this day I don’t know what it could be. I read mix reviews like scary dreams to just getting old.

,"While I’m not a vet, the crying, pacing, and hiding in places like the bathroom could be signs of discomfort or anxiety, as dogs often seek out enclosed spaces when they’re not feeling well. Since this behavior is new and seems more intense, it’s definitely a good idea to call your vet as soon as possible. It’s always better to err on the side of caution, especially with symptoms like vomiting, restlessness, and crying that could point to pain or an underlying issue. I've had two dogs with CCD and sundowning as one of the symptoms, and this is something I have not seen either of them do. I don't want to worry you more, but this would worry me.

Even though Cytopoint is generally well-tolerated, it could be related. It had a negative side effect for one of my dogs and I'd never give it again. Hopefully, this isn't related. I would definitely show this video to your vet. I hope you get some answers and relief soon!",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1i5bmmg/my_15_year_old_maltese_is_he_sun_downing_dementia/#m82hvo0,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"He's old. Things hurt that didn't used to and he can't run and play anymore. He's probably lonely since dogs can't really self-soothe. Mine like just laying around wherever I am and having me check in with just a bit of belly rubbing or head scratches and a bit of a chat. Seems to quiet their spirit and they go back to sleep for awhile. They also really like laying next to a window to look out at the world and the weather, maybe on a bed or a comfy chair turn toward the view. One of mine chose a stair landing with a few of his favorite toys around him, facing to see out the windows of the front door. Another has a bed under my desk next to my bed (which is where I do my work).
They seem to appreciate small blankets to build a nest; I wash those weekly. 
Mine are rescues who like their status as spoiled babies and behave very well with just a visit outside for 5 - 15 minutes every 2 or three hours. At night I brush them before bedtime - keeps the beds cleaner and their fur is nice for a good night's rest. 
Did this for my service dog when he was getting ready to pass on. Fed him by hand when he couldn't eat out of the bowl.

"Might be dog dementia, advice needed
I have started to notice a couple of weird habbits the last months, and now she is sometimes waking up confused during the night. After watching some videos on youtube, I am struck by how some of the things look a bit like her behaviour, and it could explain why she sits down and stare at me whinning for attention. 


I am kinda worried, and once we get home to our main vet, I will get her checked out. It will take 2 weeks, and that vet knows her history and behaviour. If its dementia, its going to explain a lot of her changing behaviour lately. :(


The thing is, if its dementia, is there things me and my boyfriend should do to help her at home? She has her own space, and water in mostly every room as well as treats. I could maybe place a dog bed in the kitchen and make her a safe corner by the table. I am worried about her. I have placed candles by every door so every room get their own scent since she is losing her sight, and it might help if its dementia?  Is there things one should do to prepare or anything else that can be done to improve her life if she is getting dementia? She is my little sister, I want her to have the best possible last years of her life. 😢



I wont know before I am home if its dementia (as we are currently dealing with my fathers hip replacement surgery in the middle of nowhere). A blood test will likely take longer to get answers to here, than it will be when we get home, and having the data transfered to my main vet. I am worried for my girl. Her heart, sight and now maybe its dementia. 😔


I really hope I can care for her proper if its dementia, and I dont want to... I hope if its dementia, she can still live a fullfilling life.

"The guilt is driving me crazy after putting my dog to sleep 
It's been 8 days since I said goodbye to my little buddy, Spade. He was 15 yrs old and I had him since he was 4 months old. I raised him, he was my baby, and I loved and will always love him so much. He always had health issues but bounced back and got meds for it. He was on daily seizure meds, oral pain meds as needed for his arthritis, among others. I was lucky to have him for 4 more years bc he had a malignant tumor removed at age 11 (without the surgery the Vet said he would have 4 months to live). I spoiled that boy as much as I could. He truly was so pure and his love was unconditional. In the recent months, he started to develop very bad anxiety and started showing signs of doggie dementia. He started pacing at night, staring at walls and had a few incontinence episodes. He just looked tired; after speaking to his regular Vet and discussing quality of life, the Vet stated, ""if you were to do it today, I wouldn't be against it."" I took my little buddy home and decided to give him the best few weeks possible and spoil him even more. As his symptoms were worsening, I made the decision to call an in-home euthanasia service. After the sedative, but before the final injection, he ran to me with his last burst of energy and his goofy smile, and collapsed on my arms. I am heartbroken, feel depressed, and the guilt is driving me insane. Did I do it too early? At the end, did he run up to me seeking protection? I'm just feeling like total crap and I miss him so so much. Some people have said to me, ""it was your choice, if it was going to be this bad, you should have kept him around longer."" Hearing those comments is definitely adding to my guilt and making me question myself so much. Any words or advice is appreciated. Thank you 🙏

This community has helped me feel as if I'm not alone, thank you all from the bottom of my heart ♥️ 🙏",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1drcaf0/the_guilt_is_driving_me_crazy_after_putting_my/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"We’ve had to put 3 down over the years, and the most recent was just a few months ago. He was 11 and the best dog ever. He had aggressive lymphoma and it all happened in the course of 3 weeks. We thought we had a few months at least. When we got into the room he was so excited (he loved his vet) that he was just like his old self. It was awful because we wondered the same thing you did. Then they gave him the first shot and he came over and collapsed on us. You could tell he was finally at peace and wasn’t in pain. If you thought it was time, then you didn’t do anything wrong. It’s a terribly difficult decision to make. I’m sure you gave him a great life and he knew it too. It’s going to suck for quite a while. We still struggle with ones from years ago.

,"You did right by your dog. The guilt you feel is because of the love you had for him. There was no better days ahead for your pup. Keeping him around any longer would’ve been selfish. You did the most compassionate thing anyone can do for a loved one, end their suffering. The pain will remain forever, but it does ease. It does slowly turn to memories of the good times. The feeling that you were robbed of him too soon will always be, but such is life. It’s never long enough. Lost my boy at 13 from dementia, just lost my girl to cancer at 14, both should’ve lived longer lives. I would love to have one more day, one more hour with them. I would give a year of my life for a day more of theirs, but I can’t. I will shed a tear for them every time I think of them because they were my world. My current boy is 6 and we just adopted a 2.5 yr old girl to be his companion. It will break me when it’s their time, but they’ve known such joy and love in the meantime.  All my dogs have been shelter pups. Idk what sort of life they had prior, but they had the best life I could possibly give them while we were together. Hopefully in time you can give that gift to another dog in need. Best of luck to you in your grieving process. Know your dog knows how much you love him.

In fields of green where shadows play,
A loyal friend prepares to stray,
From earthly bonds and loving arms,
To endless peace and heaven’s charms.

For eighteen years, a beacon bright,
Eli stood guard both day and night,
Through joyous times and tearful rain,
A steadfast heart amidst the pain.

His eyes, now dimmed, once full of cheer,
Reflect a love that’s ever near,
Though time has come to say goodbye,
His spirit soars beyond the sky.

In every bark, in every wag,
In memories, he’ll never lag,
He circles now with legs so frail,
Yet leaves a legacy, a tail.

So as he crosses rainbow’s hue,
With every step, our hearts renew,
For Eli’s love will always shine,
A cherished soul, forever mine.

"How will I know? :(
Everyone says ‘you’ll just know’ but I don’t think that’s true for me. 

My dog Tate is 14-16 (not exactly sure). He has arthritis in his hips and doggie dementia along with some tumors in his ear and throughout his body. Nothing cancerous. He is completely deaf. He was whining and anxious almost constantly, and so we started him on Prozac. Which for awhile turned him into a different dog!

But now, he’s crying almost constantly again. But especially towards evening. He sleeps a lot. 

He still gives me hell if I’m 5 minutes late for breakfast or dinner and still goes outside and enjoys the sun and our walks. But his moments of joy seem so few and fleeting. And I cannot stand the whining. Not in terms of my patience level, but that it breaks my heart and makes me cry.  

He’s been to the vet almost monthly because of it. He is on anti inflammatories, Prozac, and a sleeping pill.  

Is there anything else your vet has done for your dogs that’s helped?  Is it time? 

My husband doesn’t think he’s ready yet. But I think it might be my husband who isn’t ready. I think he would push it until the bitter end. 

I don’t want that for my boy. But I also don’t want him to go either.

"Still recovering from this loss 
Last year I posted on Reddit for the first time about my baby who was always a very scared and difficult dog to have. I received so much love and advice. Here I am again after losing her. 
I rescued her a few days after her first birthday and she was insane from then on 😂 she moved with me across the country and got me through a divorce. She ended up getting dementia early in life and became extremely difficult to take care of. In July my ex fiancé ended our engagement suddenly and we had to move and a few days later my dog Chloe had to be put down. She had a major turn from all the change and after much consideration and talks with her vet, it was time to end her suffering. I still can’t believe she’s gone but I’m so happy for the time I had with her and I hope she is okay. Doggie dementia is terrible and I’m so sorry for those who are struggling with it ",,https://i.redd.it/fhuitkzs5zud1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1g4godo/still_recovering_from_this_loss/,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's hard to lose a loved family member. Especially our smaller fury ones that have given us so much love, attention, and companionship throughout their life. Nothing can replace that. 

I shed a tear every time somebody posts about losing their best friend. 

Rest easy knowing you made her life better by ending her pain, and suffering. And that your little girl is now as happy & healthy as she's ever been. Running and playing with her siblings, relatives, and new friends. Waiting for the day when she can greet you with a big smile on her face and wagging her tail like she always has.

To be together forever, Chloe and you, and any other pets you may have had. They are all waiting for us. So try to be happy and know you will be with her again in the future.

And when we lose our dogs, we feel the loss so deeply and so differently.   We feel the loss of a love so simple, so pure and so special that we are at a loss to fully explain it.  We can only feel it, as deeply and as differently as we loved them. 

Perhaps it’s best to just accept that we’re going to be tender for a while, and a bit of a mess.   We feel what we feel out of our love for our dog, and we ought to give ourselves permission to grieve in our own deeply different way.

,"My 17 yo dachshund had ccds for his last 2 years or so. Like others said, lots of pacing, restlessness, loss of interest in toys and cuddling. But the big one was that his ability to go poo on his own and on a schedule changed in his last 6-9 months. He couldn’t make the brain/body connection and would forget what he was outside to do. If he didn’t poo before bed he would pace all night and not sleeping would further impact his cognition. Using the ice cube trick helped keep him on schedule so he could sleep through the night. It’s progressive and it will get worse, but do your best to keep your pup stimulated - new toys and puzzles, walks/sniffs in new spots, etc to try and slow the tide.

,"I adopted a 14 y old terrier in November 2023– now he’s close to 15.5– he didn’t know me— so Im not sad of him ignoring me.

I leave a night light in the bedroom, and when he wakes in the middle of the night, turn on a ceiling light. Lights are on out in the backyard to shine through windows and some Christmas lights in the living room.

He walks maybe 2 hours at a time; gets Stuck, sometimes he gets out by himself and others he cries for me to help him.

He doesn’t bark; and is not aggressive; most of his teeth were extracted last year, so no risk for bites.

He pees and poops inside; they’re are no accidents, he just go— I just clean it. He eats, sleeps and goes pee regularly.

I’m thinking: do I wait until he can no longer move, or do I stop the process? Other than the ccd— he is healthy.

I had another dog (passed in 2017); and when she got the ccd, I didn’t understand— she was 14- and I think she had it for maybe 6-12 months. One day I took it to the vet, and vet said just observe the signs of decline; a week later she could barely support her legs to go pee; and loss maybe 10 pounds- that was the point.

,"I lost my 15 year old chihuahua mix to CCD yesterday. I made the difficult decision to put him down. It started off with minor symptoms like not showing interest in me coming home anymore and not being interested in toys (which he absolutely loved). I didn’t even know CCD was a thing — just thought he was getting old. It progressed over a year and a half, his worst things being incontinence mixed with pacing. I’d go to work and come back to feces smeared in every spot on my carpet because he couldn’t hold it when I was gone and would pace around until I got home. Eventually lead to him getting diapers which didn’t do the trick 100% of the time. He had terrible sundowning and would trip over everything and anything. He would pace for hours and lost a lot of weight because of it. He lost all joy in the things that he used to love and didn’t even like laying on my lap or getting pets. 
I know there’s links with CCD and general anesthesia, I do believe my pup’s CCD worsened drastically after he was put under to get teeth removed. He never really was the same after that and I regret not looking into it more. CCD is such a hard thing to go through and my best advice is just to give your pup all the love you can.

"It's looking like tomorrow might be farewell for now. 
I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, maybe just so other people keep him in their minds in the next twelve hours or so. 

This is Buster. He's 15 and a half years old. My grandmother bought him from an online ad listing when I was just a kid (28 now) and was told he's a full bred pomeranian. We've since conceded that we were lied to and his vet says he's lucky if he's ever even smelled a full bred pomeranian which still makes me laugh. 

In the past he's survived a broken leg, gum disease leaving him with zero teeth after a full extraction, and more recently arthritis and canine cognitive dysfunction (doggy dementia) as well as reduced liver function.

He's always been an anxious little guy, but it's constant lately - the pacing in tight circles, waking up scratching and whining at 3am, uncharacteristic snapping at familiar people. We started him on pain management and anxiety medication over a year ago now when he began urinating indoors - turned out he was just too stiff to get off the sofa in time to go outside! He was back to his usual shelf, playing in the garden, desperate for cuddles; but recently even his groomer had noticed him becoming more restless and fearful, and increasing meds hasn't helped at all.

Two weeks ago he ended up with two open wounds from obsessively picking at his skin - even without teeth he did serious damage to himself from a combination of pain and CDD. He was given antibiotics, steroids, antibacterial cream and confined to the cone of shame for two weeks. He healed up beautifully but the cone had to go back on as he was still biting himself like crazy. His appetite has all but disappeared- which is so concerning as he had to use slow feeders his whole life because the boy is ravenous. 

This evening he managed to wiggle out of his cone, and his entire inner thigh is red and oozing from his constant biting and gnawing at his skin. It's not an allergy, and he hasn't been laying in urine or anything like that. Nothing will distract him, nothing will interrupt him, and it's impossible to get the cone back on because he's so aggressive. His eyesight and hearing are both fading. He doesn't want food, rarely wants company lately, and just looks so confused and scared that it breaks my heart.

I think tomorrow I need to call the vet in the morning (we have a wonderful team at the vets we go to who make us feel so safe and reassured thankfully) and ask whether they agree that it might be time to let him go with some amount of peace and dignity. We managed to sneak his Gapapentin dose into some cheese and get him to take it and he's resting now, thankfully. Still occasionally getting up to pace, but pulling at his leg less. I just know it's a huge infection waiting to happen and even if we manage to treat the physical wound again, his spirit isn't there any more, and we'll be in the same situation but worse again in another two weeks. We had a feeling he wouldn't make it past Christmas, but I didn't expect to be saying goodbye quite so soon either somehow. 

My heart is breaking as I type. He's worth every second of the sadness, but this responsibility is the heaviest part of having a four legged companion. Please think of little Buster tonight, and let me know if I'm doing the right thing. I know I am, but I need to hear it from someone else too, yknow? Love to you all.

I have a 17 year old bichon who has been showing symptoms of ccd. I need your help Reddit! He is now defecating and urinating in the house more than usual (he is/was potty trained) but I don’t think he realizes he’s doing it, or either realizes it too late. So that’s fecal incontinence as well as urine incontinence. At night he sometimes (well most of the time) paces up and down the hallways which I have self diagnosed as sundowners syndrome. He does it in the day as well but not as much. He also has some fatty tumors, one humongous one on his side, we got 2 opinions from the vets and they both said it’s just fatty tumor. I have him on a cbd regimen from CBD Dog Health. I use the calm drops to ease his anxiety and the heal drops to help slow the effects of his mental deterioration.

We take him for walks when we can, sometimes in different areas so it’s not too familiar, I try to do some stimulation with games to keep him sharp, I’m really trying anything I can.

He never used to sleep in his kennel, but now he does. Otherwise, he'll wander around the house and have accidents

Does the trazadone help her sleep? We used it nightly, right before bed, because it calmed her down & usually kept her asleep. If she woke we gave the melatonin. We also fed her a little before bed - she didn’t wake up as early whining.

,"I believe there is a CCD subreddit and maybe a Facebook group? I recall those being mentioned before on old posts, you might be able to find them by searching this subreddit. 

As for encouragement, don’t beat yourself up for feeling stress or daydreaming about relief.  I didn’t understand caregiver fatigue until dealing with this myself. It’s totally natural and valid. Taking care of these guys is super hard. We are nearing the end of our journey and being able to look at it all in retrospect, it’s really crazy to see how different our bug is from the dog he used to be. We’ve tried so hard to manage everything and to keep a level perspective for his quality of life. I think that has really helped us feel confident in making care decisions. 

So I would recommend doing quality of life scales every couple months; maybe even log changes that you see (make a timeline from the first symptoms too) so that you can maintain an objective view of their needs. I never wrote these down but would keep a mental note of his progression. 

There’s lots of medicines to try now, so don’t fret if what you’re doing now stops working. For pain, we did Adequan injections (Librela is another option, but look into it), gabapentin, and eventually had to add galliprant to the mix. He also saw a doggy chiropractor. 

For the CCD we fortunately didn’t have sundowing at night. However, he paces throughout the day. We started Selegiline first and I think this did help. Then we started CBD (ElleVet), but have only done that for 3-4 months now. I think we started these too late. They definitely help with calming him down and giving us a little glimmer of his old personality, but we didn’t get drastic changes. So I guess I’d recommend doing these sooner rather than later. 

And just remember that you can’t stop CCD. You can alleviate some of the symptoms, maybe slow it down, but there is unfortunately no cure. We tried to look at this as shepherding him into the last phase. Because of the personality change and major 24/7 care needs, we became caregivers more than companions. It’s really hard to lose them this way, but it is special to give them everything you’ve got because you love them so much. 

Sorry for the novel. Hang in there 🤍 Don’t be afraid to make the call when that time comes and don’t feel guilty if part of the reason is your own needs. That is completely valid, especially managing this on your own. That is true love and I’m sure she can feel that 🤍",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1i1l0my/are_there_any_canine_dementia_support_groups/#m781wr5,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It was a struggle to find a routine that worked for our old lady (14.5yr Bassett/cocker mix). She's on 75mg of gabapentin 1hr before bed. We find that she needs to get out and move/sniff everyday. She's got arthritis so she can't go very far so it's not so much the exercise but the sniffing/exploring exercises her brain. We let her take her time and sniff all she wants. We also give her puzzle snacks to give her something to do. (Crumpled up paper bag with some treats hidden throughout) We also make sure every morning that the curtains are opened to let the sun in. She loves sun tanning so she has beds in the sunny spots. (Sunlight exposure helps the body naturally produce melatonin)

"Tips for doggy dementia pacing and lack of interest in play/walks?


My 14.5 year old Parson Russell Terrier mix has canine cognitive dysfunction and chronic pain (and possibly cushings but we’ve kept his levels at bay with medicine). Luckily I work from home so we have a pretty set routine and I am with him 99% of the time. He takes gabapentin for his pain and we see a chiropractor so I think that’s managed pretty well. The problem is that in the morning, when we used to play and then get settled for work, he now has a new routine that consists of him pacing up and down the hall for an hour or more. 

He doesn’t play with toys anymore, which is really sad because he LOVED toys and fetch. If I try to play with him with a stuffed animal he will bite at it and immediately let go. Very rarely will we actually play tug-o-war, and if we do, it lasts literally 30 secs if I’m lucky. He doesn’t play fetch anymore either. I’d throw his ball down the hall over and over and he’d never tire. Over the last year that changed to shorter bouts from him getting tired eventually to now I throw it down the hall and he just barks at me. He does have these little squeakers (emoji-like, from Walmart) that he also used to love, and those I can sometimes get him to play with, but again, he’ll chase it down the hall if I’m lucky. I can throw it closer to him and shorten the distance, and he might go for them, but he’ll just catch it or grab it and instantly drop it and just bark at me. 

I know he is not blind or deaf (which we thought initially) as our vet verified he’s good (he does have blue overlay on his eyes from fluid build up but he’s on an ointment and she said it really just affects depth perception and night vision). I try to stimulate him with a puzzle game and putting treats in a towel I wrap up. That’s kind of substituted playing but he will still pace after doing this. If I firmly demand that he lay down or go to bed, he’ll look at me and turn around to pace again. It’s like he’s on a magnetic conveyor belt, comes down, looks into the office, turns right back around to go to the living room. And he’ll do this over and over. I let him out in case he needs to go potty but forgot, but this will continue until he either listens to me to lay down or eventually does it on his own. 

He also used to enjoy walks and walk normally with me and our other dog. Now he will be the whole length of the leash behind me for nearly the whole walk (an hour). By the end he will usually get to our pace and walk with us. It’s worse when we go through the neighborhood, he’s a little better when we go to the park. He used to be such a sniffy boy but now I consider it a good walk when he actually stops to sniff and stays up with us for any amount of time. Idk if much can be done to get him back to loving walks again but thought I’d throw that in there too in case anyone has ideas. 

I’m about to get some CBD our vet recommended so hopefully that will help. I don’t think we’re going to try that one doggy dementia med on the market because it can cause GI issues and he’s pretty sensitive in that area. But does anyone have any other tips to get him to stop pacing and any ideas on other toys that he might go for or actually play with? Thank you for any suggestions!!

,"Definitely get him in some medication like Selegiline or Trazodone. Those really help. I had one dog on Selegiline when he was 15 or 16 and it really helped his (and my!) quality of life. Eventually I did have to up his dose but it saved him.
Last year my then 16 year old dog had a fall which literally made him senile. I put him on gabapentin and Trazodone and eventually just Trazodone because the gabapentin made him sleep too much. The Trazodone helped immensely when I gave it at night, when his symptoms would kick in.
I would have liked to have tried Selegiline but the Dr never talked to me about transitioning him over to it but he did ok. 
Please discuss these medications with your doctor!
CBD wont do much, sorry :(

Also, for arthritis pain, ask them about Librela Injections! They don't help every dog, but when they do they DO!
Also it alternatively, you could try Cartroohen injections. I've seen these work wonders on dogs, even when started at an advanced age.

A natural supplement that can help with pain is green lipped mussel.

,"Our senior Aussie has dementia and right now it is worse at night. I know from experience with other senior dogs we’ve had it will progress to the day time. 

We always start with supplements. 

All our dogs are on good probiotics to ensure gut health. Ask your vet. 

The next thing we use is Vetriscience PRO Composure. These are calming treats. I have found that only the PRO line works. Unfortunately you may be past the point that these may help, but you never know! You can get these on Amazon. 

We also use compression shirts. We like Thundershirts because the cotton ones are easy to wash. Our senior likes them a lot. 

I’ve also found she thoroughly enjoys her heating pad. Go on Amazon and search for dog heating pad indoor and there are tons of options. Most of them have timers and adjustable temperatures. Our girl really enjoys this. 

She also likes her penguin. It is a buckwheat filled shell that we can put in the microwave and then stuff inside a soft penguin stuffed animal. The outside is washable. She likes to lay with her head on it or with it on her hip. Search on Amazon for microwave heat pad animal. 

Lastly we use low doses of Xanax. We decided not to use trazadone because it was way too sedating. The Xanax is more calming. Our girl is 14 and I know she will be taking this for the rest of her life. Our vet told us it’s safe but check with your vet. We give it at night but we can give a small dose in the afternoon if we need to. 

We also do training. Our girl cannot hear anymore at all so we have taught her sign language for outside, eat, walk, cookie, water and business (pee/poo). She responds really well to these and we noticed where before she would not want to get up, now when we do the sign for walk and cookie she “hops” up and “runs” to the door.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1bhv05q/tips_for_doggy_dementia_pacing_and_lack_of/#kvqvghi,,,,,,,,,,,,
,So challenging for you both. Sadly they lose interest and focus overall. I had some luck with the sundowner's restlessness and using melatonin.  The vet recommended 5 mg. You'll need to see what your vet says about it. I gave it to my 17 yr old chiweenie at dusk so it would kick in before night. It helped a bit but not completely. Keeping an area sectioned off for  nighttime that has no furniture and a dog bed is good. The pacing can turn into middle  of the night random wandering and getting stuck in odd places.

When she starts her pacing I just let her do it. I remind her that I’m here if she needs me but I also let her soothe herself. If pacing calms her down then I’m okay with it. 
My girl doesn’t always know her name so I call her silly old lady names in a quiet baby voice. That seems to get her attention. I also started making my own soft dog treats. I give her lots of “cookies” and that seems to pull her focus away from pacing.

,"Some of the problem may also be from vision/hearing loss. As they get older the lens gets cloudy - kind of like looking through a dirty windshield - it makes them more cautious when going for walks and also makes it very difficult to find their toys, especially in low light. As for hearing, they have a harder time figuring out where noises are coming from, and if there is a lot of noise, they get confused. Keeping them close to you and touching them frequently helps. If they become hesitant, bend down and say let's go. When they are pacing or seem agitated, try distracting them. Brushing, treats, playing, ear scritches, kong with peanut butter, all work well. I've been dealing with this for the last 2 years, and while I know my dog does get confused just due to his age, a lot has to do with his vision and hearing.

Selegiline increases dopamine production so maybe your dose is too high causing adrenaline like manic behavior.  I would cut the dose in half and see if that helps.

He was given 5 mg at first, then 6mo later upped to 7.5mg of selegiline (5 in AM and 2,5 at night) and the barking mostly stopped at night, no more staring at nothing, and generally seemed a little better. After a year he does stare off at nothing more now, and he is starting to bark more -but more out of wanting something (like to eat, or when it is time for treats(to get pills wrapped in deli meat)).

hi all, i just joined this group and i’m so glad i did because i see so many senior pet owners going through the same thing i am. it helps a lot. 
writing this post to ask about what folks have done in regards to when your senior pup needs dental attention/ bad teeth pulled? the vet bill estimate is $3000 and the vet said he would PROBABLY be ok because his heart is still pretty healthy, but yes there’s always a risk anesthetizing seniors and she also said that with his canine cognitive dementia she has experienced that dogs have more rapidly declined after going through the sedation so that’s a possibility? :( 

the bad teeth don’t seem to bother him unless you really try to look in there and mess with his mouth, and he still eats his food totally fine (he’s on the prescription kidney diet wet food.) it does not seem to be affecting his quality of life to the point where the vet feels its an emergency and needs to be done asap, and i also worry about the risks and if his quality of life will decline afterward? just asking what others have experienced. thank you in advance for kindness and openness i know we are all struggling in some way trying to do the best for our pups.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1bkleer/help_with_senior_doggie_dental/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"My two cents.

My husband and I rescued a senior at 12 in November 2023. She’s a Shih Tzu mix. Could eat but, her teeth were bad. All needed extracted as they weren’t well kept. Infections are the issue that you need to be most worried about, and the older they get the more risky the surgery and possible recovery.

We had them all taken out and her quality of life is better than ever. Cost was overwhelming; also around $3200 with labs. We aren’t financially well off. I do have excellent credit however, including Care Credit which many vets work with for an extended payoff plan. Paid upfront with Care Credit and some cash, then did a gofundme and recovered $2800. $2200 of which came from a single donor, (TY whomever you were.).

Focus first on the surgery. Then do your best to explore all viable financial possibilities.

It was so intense that my entire head throbbed. I started avoiding eating anything that wasn't mashed. Just eating an apple would make things worse. Dogs can mask a lot of pain and I would not want my dog to suffer like I did. No way. Never. But that's my personal experience.

It is true that things can go wrong. One of my dogs surgeries had unseen complications that impacted him the rest of his life. We could not have known it would happen. But also I would not do things differently in the future. There are no 100% safe surgeries. That's why everyone signs a waiver.

"Is it time to say goodbye?
Hi! I know that my vet is the best person to talk to about this, but I also think my vet would suggest more meds and more to keep my baby boy alive rather than considering a high quality of life. Let me preface this with the fact that I’ve lost both my stepmom and stepdad to cancer and watched their quality of life dwindle so I’m sure some PTSD from that is coming back. 

My pit mix is roughly almost 14. He was a rescue from the streets so his age is an estimate. He had started to slow down majorly this summer, beginning with hypothyroidism and a Rx to regulate that, but things really hit a big bump when we had two seizures back to back in August. He also began having major incontinence issues and began wearing diapers while I was at work.  Now, he’s on daily arthritis medicine and twice daily seizure and hypothyroidism medicine. He was also diagnosed with “doggie dimentia” or canine cognitive disorder in October. 

In the last two weeks, his “sundowning” has gotten worse. When I’m home on the weekends, I notice that he paces and paces and paces nonstop. Not to mention, I often take my AirPod pros to bed with me so I can turn on the noise canceling function due to his pacing and whining (after I’ve checked on all the things like fresh water, trying to guide him to his bed and helping him lay down, pets for a min or two). I usually get up around 1am to let him out for a midnight potty break. He is wearing diapers all the time now. 

He does not seem to enjoy going for walks at all. He often will just poop and pee on my back deck. When he does go off the deck, there have been a few times where he wants to run off but it’s with a wild look, like he’s lost. And I have to grab and guide him back to the house. He whines and moans more than ever in his life, mostly at night. He paces and paces and winds up in a corner not knowing how to get out, he’ll get tangled up in the barstool legs or chair legs on the deck. 

He is still excited about eating, but that literally seems to be his only bright spot. I have two kittens that he tolerates and seems to love, but not necessarily plays with or even really does much more than “snuffle” them when they’re all at the door waiting to go out. 

I’ve read that it’s better to put them down a month early than a day late, and I love him so much. I want to do right by him. Any words of advice?",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/189wu5w/is_it_time_to_say_goodbye/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. Your situation sounds very similar to the one we were in with our 15 year old dog earlier this year. She was not terminally ill, but had numerous chronic conditions that had made her quality of life so very low. She also had cognitive dysfunction and restlessness at night. It was so very difficult to deal with that. After many months of slow but steady continued decline, we decided it was time. It was a horribly painful decision to make and we struggled with feeling like we did it to soon. It’s been almost 3 months now and we are feeling more at peace with it. 

There are a few canine quality of life scale you can find online. Those were somewhat helpful. Ultimately though, you know your dog and I think you have to trust your gut. I agree that it’s better to do it in earlier rather than later when you are dealing with a low quality of life.

,"Hi, i had to put my baby to sleep at 22 after a bad fall, and still, sometimes in grief figure out ways to feel bad for it, so I get that it’s likely  never going to be without contrast, even when it’s absolutely the kinder thing.

But since you’re bringing up the dementia, Catherine, who lived to 22 started with that at 19 

there was a period of time where I was dealing with the pacing and whining, accidents, and just feeling awful about it. Thinking it might be time. She was always anxious and didn’t seem to be enjoying life 

I started giving her different supplements, switched her to a raw diet and it went away completely. We had 2,more years, she made it to my engagement and then to my marriage, and  that was worth everything to me. 

I became an orphan at 20 and so I understand also the stress of impending grief. Whatever you decide is going to be what’s best, but just know that nutrition can do wonders, and it might be worth experimenting with, because even if he doesn’t have that much time left,

"When do you know it’s time?
I have a senior chihuahua who is 18 years old. I have had my pup since I was 4. Unfortunately he was diagnosed with cancer and a heart condition on the same day 3 years ago. He’s was doing relatively well for someone with his conditions because we manage it the best we can. To top that he became partially blind and deaf last year. Sadly, he has also been experiencing cognitive canine disorder for the past year and a half and it’s only getting worse. He walks around in circles for the most part and so the vet told us to confine him to a space and so we did. He has his bed and food all surrounded in pee pads in his area that is gated in a room. He barks all night and is restless. We sit with him for hours and try to comfort him and he won’t stop. And sometimes when he does he’ll just start again 2 hours later. We give him his prescribed sleep medication but it doesn’t work, and if we give him more than half of the pill then he’s too drowsy in the morning and way more alert at night. He also poops and pees randomly some days and he steps on it instead of asking for us to let him out. Even though we lay pee pads everywhere it still gets everywhere… 
Sometimes he has his good days where he doesn’t give us trouble sleeping but we still have to keep up the routine of picking him up and taking him outside cause he can’t find his way to the door.  (Again he only walks in circles)
It’s honestly been so hard for me and my mom. We never sleep and it’s been putting a strain on our relationship and we’re not sure what to do anymore. The vet says he’s not in pain but at the same time it just seems like his quality of life isn’t great. He’s not the pup he used to be. It’s like I have a stranger in my house that doesn’t even know where he is. 
I think that it’s time to say goodbye but my mom wants no part of it. We’ve both tried our best to keep him comfortable and happy but I don’t think that he is happy. We’re definitely not. What do you guys honestly think we should do? Is it time?

"Suddenly anxious dog (perspectives needed)
So, I've [submitted something to askVet](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/152lhgz/sudden_onset_of_elderly_dog_anxiety/), but it probably won't get a lot of action (too long and indirect) which is understandable. So, I thought I would bring this up here too. 

I've got a 13 y/o, 35lb female mix who was never chill but also not anxious. I'm working with a vet but need more information than I can get in our visits. She's got arthritis, pings at a solid normal on the [Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Rating](http://rng.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CCDR-scale-revised.pdf) (though I'm worried about this long-term), and still enjoys everything/life. 

That said, we took a road-trip a month ago. She held up well but had some panic attacks at the end. I think she was done with it. Since then, she's had three sleepless nights (panting can't settle) and one morning. 

We've had a lot of severe weather earlier in the summer, increased wildlife, and fireworks now. None of these had been a problem in the past. It's really like her stress/anxiety response is.just.different. 

My questions:

1.  For those with experience in canine anxiety, does it come and go? Have you seen it have quick onset?  

2. Other than the upcoming vet appointment, is there anything else I should be thinking of? 

This all seemed to change so fast, that it feels kinda like end game, but nothing seems too wrong for an 13 y/o pup. Part of it could be the loss of sleep.

"Dementia and senilife
My 15.5 year old yorkie, Bentley, has been deteriorating very quickly this last half of 2022. He has developed canine cognitive dysfunction or doggie dementia, and his eyesight is near gone. I brought him to the vet last week and with their recommendation plus my own research, I purchased senilife supplements to try. 
He got one dose of senilife in his dinner on Monday night, and proceeded to have diarrhea and vomiting at bedtime, which has been ongoing since Monday til today (Thursday). 
I didn’t come across any reviews of senilife that caused GI upset. Bentley has a pretty sensitive stomach so it could be that he ate something off the ground (I have a toddler). I am hesitant to restart senilife but I really want to give it a try because of all the great reviews and supposed effects on canine dementia.

How can they make that claim?? I can’t quite put my finger on it but something about this doesn’t seem right. Sounds a bit too sketchy for me personally but I also by trade am more skilled in researching and developing recommendations for human health, not veterinary health, so maybe it’s just that part of it for me.

I’m not opposed to supplements for my dogs though. I personally give my dogs a Zesty Paws senior supplement every morning and I don’t know if it’s doing much for them or not but my oldest gal seems to be doing great on it! She’s got more energy, moves a bit easier, and in general seems pretty happy ever since starting. That’s just my two cents.

,"I know this thread is now 2 years old, but I'm having a hard time finding anything online regarding senilife side effects.  My 11 year old chiweenie started having intermittent bouts of doggie dementia/sundowners, and the vet recommended trying senilife.  She's been on it for almost 2 weeks and appears to have more energy/alertness during the day and is sleeping better through the night.  That is, until last night when she needed to go potty outside 6 times - with each time being out there for a good 5-10 mins. (Normally, IF she gets up to go at night it's only once and she's out and back within 2 mins) 


This morning I decided to keep an eye on her (and because it was no longer pitch black outside) and the poor girl had light brown mucus poop with a little blood.  I'm unsure if she are something she wasn't supposed to yesterday, or if the senilife is starting to negatively effect her.  I will repost updates as they arise.


I do find it REALLY odd that publications indicate there are ZERO side effects of senilife.  Like, common, there's always some type of potential side effect, even if it's a very small percent.  I am still skeptical about senilife being an upside-only miracle cure.

Hi, all!

I have a great dane mix, going on 10 years old. He's been to the vet and, along with myelopathy, the doctor also believes he is showing overall signs of CDD Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. 

The myelopathy has been depressing to witness, needless to say. But just today, my dog's CDD has seemed to kick into overdrive. He's having these episodes where he looks more lost and confused than ever. But this is the part that is weirding me out, and I can't find anything on...

During these ""episodes"" and while laying down, he'll pick up his head and turn his eyes and head back and forth and sniff the air. He looks right at me, and smells in my direction. He looks around, looks lost some more, and smells. He doesn't get all the way up; he just smells and moves his eyes around. He'll do this for about 10 minutes, until he goes back to just looking lost.

"My 10yr old dog’s health seems to be increasingly deteriorating….
Hi, I’ve noticed that my lab mix (10yrs old) has been visibly/increasingly aging over the last several months. We’ve been to vet more frequently as his arthritis worsens and his digestive system seems to be going haywire. 

I’ve noticed his energy levels decreasing, his fur is changing, and then this morning he refused to eat his breakfast despite being (almost overly) enthusiastic about eating his entire life and regardless of if he was experiencing vomiting/diarrhea.  He isn’t having any diarrhea or vomiting right now so it’s even stranger that he seems to have lost his appetite. The vet doesn’t know what’s causing his gastrointestinal issues or appetite loss and today I just broke down because I can sense that he’s in the last few years of his life (fingers crossed we have that much time left) and I can’t stop him from growing old, all I can do is to ease any discomfort he feels and give him the best life possible.

I want to take him on a road trip this summer before he becomes too old, as he absolutely loves car rides and outdoor adventures/swimming in new places. Is there anything else you have done to make the last few years the best they can possibly be (aside from staying on top of his health)? 

I need help dealing with the anticipatory grief I’m feeling. 

Any suggestions or sharing experiences will be greatly appreciate. TIA!

,"Hi, I also have a black lab mix with arthritis and a collection of ""old man"" ailments. Librela has been helping a lot and also much, much love and attention. 
They have ups and downs and mine gives me some sort of ""annual health scare"", especially in winter. I had a lot of anticipatory grief, because we adopted him at age 12 and were expecting a hospice situation. I got rid of the grief, built a great alliance with his excellent vet and went for a ""not today"" approach to loving our dog. He looks very much like yours. He will be 17 in March 2025 😊

We also took a trip to his country of origin and we all loved it. It's a great idea!

Edit: forgot to add that your dog is stunning!! I wish you well.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1g9pn2a/my_10yr_old_dogs_health_seems_to_be_increasingly/#lt9110v,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I agree with the sentiment of not dwelling on it and enjoying your time together, to a degree. Love your friend. Be more forgiving as their body starts to fail them. Give them better treats. They earned it.

But, I think it's important to consider what might be where you decide that their quality of life has gone beyond the point you want them to live with. 

For my wife and I, we discussed it and if our dog couldn't feed themselves, get off the floor themselves, and seemed like they might be in more pain than anti-inflammatories could help them with, then we would discuss sending them over the rainbow road. 

I imagine every dog and their persons will have their own metric. 

As for grief, know that it's going to happen. I cried with my dog a lot before it was finally time. I cried unconsolably when I finally said goodbye. I'm crying now and that was 4 years ago. But grief is just another beautiful shade of love. Trying to avoid it entirely makes it an enemy of love, not a companion, and it will find you anyway.

Good luck. Feel it all, and they never really leave you.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1g9pn2a/my_10yr_old_dogs_health_seems_to_be_increasingly/#lt9fa9p,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"What a precious boy you have there-so handsome! 
As the other comment suggested you must focus on the good times...sadness and fear will creep in, but try to remain focused on positive thoughts. 
For years prior to my boy's passing, I was consumed with negative thoughts...I couldn't imagine my life without him. Looking back, I wish I wouldn't have punished myself like that bc the reality was he wasn't going to live forever and processing the loss was inevitable. 
Regarding his appetite...maybe mention Zofran to your vet...it can help with an upset stomach.
Shower your boy with love and take him on those awesome road trips!

He was at a healthy weight, energy levels were way up, and he was running and jumping again. He lived happily and healthy with no signs of slowing down until he peacefully passed away in his sleep just before his 13th birthday.

"My heart is broken
Gary, our beloved 14-year-old border terrier, was more than just a dog, he was a member of our family, a constant friend and a source of endless joy and love.

From the moment Gary came into our lives, his bright spirit and boundless energy filled our hearts and our home. Over the years he became the most loyal friend anyone could ask for, always being there for us through the ups and downs of life. He just seemed to understand everything, and his wagging tail never failed to light up even the darkest of days.

He had a knack for making everyone feel special, greeting us with excitement every time we walked through the door and curling up close during quiet moments. Even in his later years, as his health failed, he lost his hearing and his youthful enthusiasm for life waned, his love for us was always strong as was ours for him.

Though he has left us, Gary’s memory will live on in the stories we tell, the laughter he inspired, and the love he gave so freely. He taught us the true meaning of loyalty, unconditional love, and living in the moment.

We will miss you, your playful spirit, your gentle soul, and the warmth you brought to our lives. You were, and always will be, our good boy.

May there be endless fields to run in and plenty of treats over the rainbow bridge.

after 8 years of being with us, our precious yoda has officially crossed the rainbow bridge today. to say my heart is numb is an understatement to several degrees. after the dog before her sustained injuries that my mom and i couldn’t accommodate, she filled the void he left behind. we got her at 8 or 9 years old in 2016, and we didn’t know how long she had. she surprised us each and every day, with her weight loss so she could be healthy, her trust in us developing more and more, and the puppy she never was shining through, as if being with us was her second chance. over the course of the last year or so. her health took a serious turn for the worst. i made her promise me june 2023 that she would see me graduate high school. june 2024, she was still around and watched me receive my diploma. she also stuck around to see me start my first year of being a college student.

After a long 17 years and a long list of health problems, I decided it was time. He was surrounded by our family and got to eat hamburger and chocolate before passing in my arms.

"2nd Farewell Post to Ginger 12/6/24 🌈
Now that I can think more clearly and is in the process of grief. I want to add more details about Ginger so everyone can know what a wonderful personality he had. We got him when he was 3 months old in 2010 and he was the best little brother and the worst brat since! He throws a tantrum when we make him share his toys with other dogs by rolling around in the dirt, he jumps onto our dining table when he thinks we left him alone, he steals candies and hide them into corners of the couches, and forget about personal spaces, he would place his butt right in my face as he lays down next to me. He had such a big personality and he will be greatly missed. I understand that the past couple years his health has been declining and it dramatically crashed the past week. I hope he knows he was loved as I cleaned his ear daily before work, make sure he gets 2-3 home-cook meals a day, make sure he takes his allergy meds, daily walk around the block, and his constant trips to the vet (even though he hated it!). Every night, he would wait for my parents to turn off the lights to follow them to their room to sleep around 8pm and then he would creep over to my room at 11pm! I got stairs for him, so he would not wake me up having to pick him up the bed. The day repeat after that for 15 years. I will not let the past week’s image of him overtake the 15 years memories we have of him but in his final moments before his heart stops beating, he lifts his head with his face pointing and eyes stared deep into our eyes knowing that it was his time. You are loved and will forever be missed, in my heart and mind, always. So go on and run wild now little brother just don’t forget to visit me sometimes!

Thank you all for taking the time to read and listen. Writing this post has been a therapeutic way for me to process my grief and reflect on what a wonderful companion Ginger was.

"I’m having an extremely hard time moving on after my dog’s passing. I don’t like my life post Teddy. My little Theodora was my heart and now I have to live without her.  How is this even possible?
27/11/2007-24/10/2024 


I made the hard decision 2 Thursdays ago. I had them come to my place to do it. I haven’t been back to my apartment since. I’ve been sleeping at my elderly mom’s apt. Slept at a friends place too one night. 
My sweet little girl’s kidneys were failing. I was told a year before that it would eventually happen but never prepared myself mentally for when the time came. That shit happens fast when it comes. Boom and it’s over. I had her hospitalized for 5 days 4 nights prior and she started regressing once back home. Brought her back the next day but for day hospice. The day after that they told me to come get her as she wasn’t improving. So I basically traded her pain for mine 3 days later. I’m still inconsolable. I’m seeing a mental health professional weekly.. have my second session this week. 
It was just her and me for 17 years and I never felt alone for one second. We went everywhere together. Travelled everywhere together. My home & my heart is now empty with no one to share the burden of grief with. Mornings are tough. Nights are tougher..and I’m just supposed to go to work like nothing happened. Work is a distraction, which is nice, but then what?
She was the brightest light. My best friend, my partner, my one and only true love. It’s not just my dog who passed away, my entire household is gone. There’s a really kind redditor I’ve been exchanging messages with (thank you 2dogs1man) so I appreciate this community a lot and wanted to thank everyone who has shared love in my previous post as well. I just hope i get out of this. I don’t wish this feeling on my worst enemy. She had a great life and I did as well by her side but my little cocker beagle baby is gone forever and that just kills me. Thanks for letting me rant. Rest in peace Teddy girl. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gjt97d/im_having_an_extremely_hard_time_moving_on_after/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It is definitely hard. I lost my 14yr old in January and my 15.5 yr old in April. I cried every single day for about 4 months. I even got a puppy but I would walk the puppy and cry.

,"I’m so sorry for the loss of Teddy. I lost my father in the end of January and our life was turned upside down. My wife and I don’t have children and poured our hearts and focus into our two dogs which helped. Then we lost Annabelle , our 12 year old boxer on  9/25  and two days later my 11 year old Doberman had to go to for emergency surgery and has her eye removed due to glaucoma and apparently cancer. They gave her a good prognosis and she seemed to be recovering well until she had a rapid decline and died in the same place in our living room as her sister 10/27. Total shock and disbelief as I did CPR and tried for what seemed like forever to get her heart going again and get her breathing. It didn’t work and we are crushed. The bowls still have water. The toy bins and leashes are still present, joined by the condolence cards and urns. It’s the absolute worst feeling ever, and I always knew this would be a possibility, but damn it’s not any easier than losing a family member, because dogs like Teddy are family. I wish I had some Sage words of advice, but I don’t.

Tonight we lost her brother, Nomar. He has had some health issues over the past few years but didn’t expect things to escalate this quickly.

,"This was sent to me by a breeder when I really needed it. Please pass it along to anyone who needs its comforting words: 

“All I can say is that I know how it feels when a personal dog dies and that it never gets easier, the older I get. However let it be a comfort to you that the pain will turn into great memories of lessons given to you by your dog; lessons about love, loyalty, happiness, forgiveness, courage, humbleness, and zest for life and most importantly about yourself. I believe that dogs are God’s gift which he gave us so that we have a chance to learn these lessons from them. They are also here to give us comfort and encouragement when we are down. Thus our dogs are not just our guardians, but most importantly they are our teachers. And when their dog’s job is done, then they have to go to doggie heaven back to God. The pain we feel when the dog goes young or old is so great, I know. However, it is only a bargain tuition which we pay for these great lessons, protection and happiness the dog so generously and selflessly gave us.

Cherish these lessons and remember that your dog is not buried in the woods under a tree or in the desert or in the urn, but please know that your dog is buried in your heart where he will live in your memories as long as you do. Anytime you want your dog, he will jump smiling from the tall grass and remind you of the happy times which you have had together and will have forever.

He's been my best friend since his rescue at 9 months. We've been dealing with hyperthyroidism for 6 years, and he's at 75% kidney failure, and constant blood in his urine. My vet says he his oldest patient and equivalent to an 150 year old human when you take in to account his breed, age, and health issues. His quality of life has been excellent, even with all he has going on. This last week he took a turn. He hasn't ate in three days, stands still and waivers, and just looks like his will is leaving.

"My 9 yr old German Shepherd’s decline in physical health
My female German Shepherd just turned 9 last month. She was 75 lbs in her prime, now is about 88 with less physical activity (still figuring out new foods and amounts). Last Oct 2023, she was diagnosed with Spondylosis and arthritis in the knees as well as Pannus. A few days ago, she hurt herself on a walk, and the vet thinks she may have torn her CCL (similar to ACL). 

I’ve been a wreck. Starting in Oct 2023, it took me some time to adjust and accept the new normal of daily pain meds, anti inflammatories (that are hard on her system), eye drops, new harness vs collar setup and eyeglasses (she hates them). The vet advised she never go off leash, swim, play fetch (advised to roll) or do anything that would stress her neck again. These are all the things my dog loves. 

Fast forward to yesterday (only 6 months after first diagnoses) where the vet told me the surgery would be $2-4k for the CCL injury. I’ve already spent so much on X-rays, vet visits, red light therapies, meds, gear, new foods, probiotics, joint supplements and salmon oil that I’m trying to sell as much stuff as I can and trying to eat as least as I can. 

If I chose to let time do it’s thing vs surgery, I have to use a Help em up vest, only do short leash walks in the backyard for her to potty, and not allow her to leap. She can’t get on the couch, up a step or on my bed without me picking her up, and she doesn’t really like me to try. I also hand fed her last night bc I can tell she’s in pain. It took some time. 

My dog will eventually develop scar tissue (but not technically heal), so that when she walks she’ll overcompensate on the other leg. I have to pretty much not let her move for weeks. Vet suggested cold / hot compresses, but my dog gets annoyed, whines, pants and tries to go somewhere else.

This is my best friend that has been with me 9 years. She is typically active and playful. I’m not keen on putting her under anesthesia as an older dog, and I hear the CCL surgery healing process can be excruciating and take 6+ months. It doesn’t sound like she’ll be the same either route I go. 

What’s most heartbreaking is she is all mentally here and still a pup who wants to frolic and play, but her body can’t comply. I’m trying my best but I can already tell she’s over the meds and is frustrated. I hate seeing her like this. Im so angry that I’m pushing my friends away here, and I don’t sleep well. 

I’m at a loss, I feel like I’m alone in this. I don’t know who else to talk to. For context, I’m a single 34F living in Colorado Springs. It’s expensive here, and it’s hard enough to just support myself. I keep applying for side gig work on top of my full time job as I work remotely and am willing to work more, but I hear nothing back. I originally got my dog with an ex but he’s been out of the picture for a while. 

I just happened to have a couple, less than a week trips to see very good friends of mine coming up in a couple months and feel so torn about leaving her. She has great dog sitters but they don’t stay overnight or anything. I don’t have family around here so I desperately wanted to take these trips for my own mental health. 

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Any advice you can offer? TIA. Here’s a photo of her, stuffed animals used to prop up her injured leg. She DOES seem to like that.

,"Start evaluating, as objectively as you can, with a quality of life scale:

https://vetsocialwork.utk.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Quality-of-Life.pdf

I'm starting to do this with my 14-15 year old Husky/GSD/everything else mutt. She's got arthritis (Librela has been amazing); just ordered runners for my tile floors. She's way less active, and her weight tucked up a couple of pounds (still in her normal healthy range  46 lbs). She can still get up onto the bed and the sofa but it's clearly more of a struggle; I did have to get her a ramp to get in my Jeep. 😢 but if I have a steak for dinner she's right there next to me alive and energetic and hyper focused so I know she's still very much with me. When I take her to the beach all she wants to do is walk around and sniff, so that's what we do. I'm just letting her set the pace…",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1c32m64/my_9_yr_old_german_shepherds_decline_in_physical/#kze16ce,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this.  I had two GSDs as a single female from 21-35 and they were my whole life.  I ended up putting Lola down at 12 so because her mobility got so bad after years of the affects of hip dysplasia.  I put sam down at 14.5 because she was declining in all areas and there was no quality of life left.  Here is my advice from my experience. 

Don’t leave her any more if you can.  I think when she does pass you’ll be grateful that you capitalized on every moment you could.  For me, my dogs hated when I left them, especially the one with more health problems .  Like you, for the last few years I had to carry her to go upstairs/get on the bed/get in the car.  She only trusted me to do it.  

Don’t be too scared by your pannus diagnosis.  Lola was diagnosed at 3 with it and it was comfortably controlled with daily eye drops until she passed at 12.5.  We never had to use glasses.  I hope the same for you.  But if it’s worse, I am sorry. 

Adequan is what helped the most with my girls arthritis.  It is an injectable glucosamine.  I also got a wheel chair so Lola could still go on walks the last two years of her life . 

Again, I’m so sorry you’re going through this.  I miss my girls every day and still feel the heartbreak like it was yesterday, but I’m so grateful I had them.  They changed my life. 

Lastly, the thing that helped the most when deciding if it was time was the Journeys scale. And when I did have to put them down, I had a vet come to my house each time and it was so peaceful.  I felt I did right by them. https://journeyspet.com/quality-of-life-scale-pets/",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1c32m64/my_9_yr_old_german_shepherds_decline_in_physical/#kzeji3o,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Surgery for the CCL is the best way to go about this. Recovery is 8 weeks until the bone is fully healed, and 12 weeks before going back to normal activity. They will be nearly 100% back to normal at this time. TPLOs are the gold standard and have a huge success rate with multiple doctors, including some general practicioners, being comfortable doing them. 

This is not something I would wait on or put off if possible. Letting scar tissue develop will just lead to arthritis, instability, and pain down the line.

Edit: look into the boulder humane society and the Denver dumb friends league for low cost and subsidized TPLOs",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1c32m64/my_9_yr_old_german_shepherds_decline_in_physical/#kzelupx,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"In 2021 I lost a dog who was only 8.5 years old and I was not ready to let go of.  I spent roughly $30K dollars at the emergency vet trying to save her, and not only did it not work, but it prolonged her suffering.  My husband and I have no kids and could afford to do it.  The cost impact was more of an abstract ""yikes!"" than something that affected our lifestyle.  The hardest part of it all was knowing how we prolonged her suffering.  I have pictures of her with her eyes closed, emaciated and shaking.  

The average lifespan for a German shepherd is 9-13 years.  I can't tell from your photo anything other than she looks like a sweet girl.  You deal with her daily and know what her quality of life is like.  Don't feel bad about not being able to afford the surgery.  I've been a poor dog mom and a dog mom of some means, and all my dogs lived equally happy lives.  The top requirements of a happy dog are food and water, exercise, and a loving home with a person she can bond with.  So many great dogs struggle to get that last part especially.  You've given her the gift of your love for 9 years.

Ultimately it's up to you to decide when it's time to say goodbye.  But don't feel bad about not being able to afford expensive surgery that will cause her discomfort, and can only reverse the effect of injury, not aging.  Any dog who has a person struggling with the ultimate decision in the end is a very lucky animal indeed.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1c32m64/my_9_yr_old_german_shepherds_decline_in_physical/#kzfdkp4,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I am so so sorry. This broke my heart. I went through a very similar thing with my senior boy the last year and a half or so of his life. We ended up getting a harness for him because he couldn’t walk without help anymore. I felt so bad for him. I ended up cutting back my hours, and eventually quitting my job to stay home with him the last several months of his life. It’s the only way I could feel okay with keeping him here.. we hung out all day so I hope that he didn’t mind too much that he couldn’t get around on his own. Idk. 
I know most people are unable to do that, but I’m really grateful that I was able to. 

I do have a recommendation though! My boy did really well on CBD oil. I could tell it helped his pain some and it seemed to really help chill him out for bedtime. I could tell a difference when we ran out. Just want to suggest that because it may be worth trying!",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1c32m64/my_9_yr_old_german_shepherds_decline_in_physical/#kzlhxjg,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Our dog tore his acl during covid and we had no surgery option (supply issues). We went the rehab route - got him a double leg brace and did physio at home (,walk around a table both clockwise and counter clockwise, did stretches and massage). 3 years later he's mobile albeit arthritis set in though he's 13 now. Maybe explore physio options in your area as it might be less invasive and even cheaper.

,"This is so hard. My last dog faced mobility challenges in the last years. It was a slow decline and a lot of weeks where we were limited activity and hoping healing would come with time. I am very familiar with the help em up harness.

For me it was so emotionally difficult to see my dog want to do things he couldn't. I had to change my expectations of what a good life looked like for my dog. Maybe he couldn't go on 4 walks a day anymore. But I could get a big dog stroller and he loved sitting in there, especially when I pushed the stroller really fast. Maybe he couldn't walk in the park, but we could still go for a car ride and get a pup cup and maybe stand in the park long enough for him to poop. Maybe he couldn't fetch, but if I waved a squeaky toy around his face dramatically and then dropped it in front of him, he still acted like he was tearing apart a falcon that he personally caught. He couldn't wag his tail anymore or dance when he was excited, so I had to learn to read different signals for what made him happy. 

I also live alone and the grief was overwhelming. I was grieving what he lost and I did need friends around me to help me see what I could do that could still make his life awesome and to also tell me how much worse he'd gotten in just a few weeks. This helped me celebrate the wins and also know when it was time. Hang in there and keep just a few friends close.

Colorado Springs is a really dog friendly, young city. You may be able to work out some kind of trade where you watch someone elses dog. There are also some veterinary clinics that will do boarding, so you know someone reputable is keeping an eye on your dog. There are also some dog rescues that may pay or fundraise for surgery, without you needing to give up the dog. Even your local county shelter may have resources for people who need low cost vet support or dog food.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1c32m64/my_9_yr_old_german_shepherds_decline_in_physical/#kzh1b96,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Goodbye, my love.
Hello again friends. My beloved Sophie girl took her final journey yesterday at 5pm. Things took a turn for the worst after her appointment on Saturday and I had to make the devastating decision to let my girl go peacefully in my arms. I held her until the very end and we laid her to rest beside her kitty cat best friend from her puppyhood. Despite the apparent improvement to her heart function, her health otherwise deteriorated rapidly and after a painful conversation with her veterinary team it was in her best interest to let her go. 

My heart is beyond broken and I’ve spent the last 23 hours alternating between convulsive sobbing and an overwhelming feeling of emptiness. I simply don’t know what to do without her. She’s been the center of my world since I was 11, and even more so since her diagnosis of CHF in December. I woke up this morning and started trying to put her morning meds together before the realization hit me again and I fell apart. 

My tophie girl. How lucky I am to have loved you. You loved me even when I did not feel worthy of it. You saw me through all of the biggest events of my life so far. It was an honor and a privilege to have spent this life by your side. I love you more than words can express and I will spend the rest of my life missing you. Until we meet again, my baby girl.

"Health anxiety
Just looking for any advice/support/commiseration you can offer. We lost our 10 year old good boy about a year ago and our other good boy is now 9 and healthy, but has started showing some very very mild sundowners—just inexplicably anxious some evenings, so he barks incessantly. We have Gabapentin that we give him when we notice this and he does great on it. He is in perfect health otherwise, aside from lifelong storm/car anxiety. But I think my grief from our other dog is catching up with me. When he has an episode, my anxiety skyrockets and I can’t function. Even after he has calmed down, I can’t relax and enjoy myself. I’m in therapy and for sure plan on bringing this up in my next session, but wanted to hear from people with senior dogs—how do you just chill and enjoy their golden years with them without overthinking every little old dog quirk and creak?",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ekr5vt/health_anxiety/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"First, have to say I completely understand how you're feeling. My 14.75 y/o Husky got sick just over a week ago (I posted about looking for food recommendations for her yesterday), and I've been watching her like a hawk since then, despite all the assurances from the ER vet and primary vet that she's recovering nicely and she's not in any immediate danger. I definitely take any little flutter of ears, water intake, other benign behaviors, way more seriously than I should. Yes, I know she can't talk, so I take it upon myself to be ready for everything. Fortunately, my wife and I have been seeing slow but steady progress. I'd venture she's about 75% recovered? The meds have made a difference, and feel less concerned going into her follow up appointment later this month.

With that said, you mentioned you would bring up your anxiety to your therapist at your next session. Perhaps it would be worth scheduling an appointment with the vet as well to discuss what you're seeing? You know the anxiety exists, but if you're seeing anything different such as new triggers, an appointment would make the most sense. My other dog has general anxiety plus separation anxiety. It took about a year of work with our vet (plus some sessions with a dog trainer) to reach a point where we trained her to not freak out + find the meds that worked best for her (in our case, she gets Amitriptyline for general anxiety and Sileo for situational anxiety, such as our leaving the house).

It's clear you're doing everything you can, so working out a plan with your vet to ensure your dog is enjoying their golden years as much as possible is the best thing you can do for both them and yourself.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ekr5vt/health_anxiety/#lgmpdy9,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It's been 3 weeks & I'm still struggling
My sweet, sweet Abbie crossed the rainbow bridge July 8th and the pain is still so raw. Everywhere I look, I see her & late I night I swear I hear her collar jingling.  The first  3-4 fays after she passed, I physically thought I was dying..felt like a horse was sitting on my chest. I got her when she was 6 weeks old and we've been inseperable ever since. She was almost 14 and in the last 6 months it was obvious that she was slowing down. Sleeping more and moving a little slower - that was to be expected for her age but she still had bursts of energy (she loved to chase the lawnmower, play with her beloved toys and chase our chickens). 
This girl was never, not once sick or had any health issues her entire life but, the last 2 weeks of her life she stopped eating her dog food and seemed confused at times but would eat chicken or any other food that I would make for her. The last week of her life she just stopped eating all together. My husband and I made the gut wrenching decision to take her to be put down on Friday, July 5th after 5 days of no food but to our surprise, our vet thought some steroids would bring her appetite back. What? I couldn't believe my ears & was ecstatic but that was very short lived and by Saturday night I knew it wasn't going to work (it didn't). She always weighed 4.5lbs and was down to 3.2lbs. When we went to bed Sunday night, I sat up all night long holding her and telling her how wonderful she has been and how much I loved her and then took her Monday morning to be put down. The vet said something like ""I'm sorry, I guess she really was as sick as you said"" and I'm still angry w/ our vet for giving me false hope but am learning to let that go. 
One of our favorite things to do was to go for early evening rides on the 4wheeler and I'll cherish those memories forever. I still can't  really look at the thousands of pictures I have of her and even choosing a few for this post filled my eyes with tears. We had her cremated and I already bought a necklace to to put some of her ashes in to have her with me 24/7 and have ordered an urn from a talented artist who wil be hand painting her picture on it. I know I'm rambling and appreciate you taking the time to read. I know many of you are or have experienced this and my broken heart goes out to everyone struggling with pet grief.

"Advice needed, 16 year old female dog with mammary cancer, is treatment even viable?
Hello, apologies in advance if I come off confusing, I don’t have much experience with cancer terminology and am learning as I go. 

I was just told by the vet that my senior female dog (bichon/poodle mix) has mammary cancer/tumors in the bottom lymph nodes of her stomach and they’re metastatic. She’s 16 and has two big lumps on the bottom part of her stomach, however the vet said compared to what he’s seen, her lumps aren’t that big. He explained to me that even with surgery, the cancer could just reappear in 2-3 months, and the site would be difficult to heal since it’s at the lower part of her stomach, the stitches could risk opening with her just walking. He didn’t do X-rays or any invasive testing to see which tumors are malignant or benign since the cancer being metastatic kinda nulls the need to do that at least from what I understand. He also mentioned with this type of cancer there’s a risk it can travel to the liver and heart which would of course be deadly. 

She’s a very energetic and playful dog otherwise, but with her being 16 I wonder if surgery would just delay the inevitable. I’m guessing you guys read a lot of post asking if surgery/treatment for cancer in an elderly dog is worth it, quality vs quality of time etc, and I guess I’m kinda asking the same. Mostly tho I would really like to get the perspective of anyone who’s been through similar and how do you cope with the choice you made, how do you even make a choice? There’s a part of me that wants to throw money at the wall and make sure I did everything I could. But there’s also a part of me that knows that with cancer and her age, I’d just be delaying the inevitable at her expense. I guess I don’t want to miss out on surgery while she’s still energetic and especially don’t want to delay it since she’s already old. But if she’s gonna live those 2-3 months anyway that it would take for the cancer to reappear, maybe it’s better to not do it at all. Hell even the best case scenario of her living 1-2 more years if the cancer doesn’t spread is not enough time for me.

I’m just too scared to make a choice and be wrong, how do you get over that fear? Is it even worth getting a second opinion? My vet admitted he’s not a specialist and he could refer me to a hospital vet, but idk if that’s even worth it. While is wish it was otherwise, I also unfortunately don’t have the money to go crazy and take her to any vet and do every treatment either, the surgery the vet recommended was quoted to be at least 900 at that’s already a lot for me. Idk my brain is just a mess right now and I just don’t want any regrets associated with her passing when the time eventually does come. I don’t want that guilt to cloud over her memory, but I also can’t read the future so idk if I’ll ever make a perfect decision. 

Sorry for the word vomit, any advice, tips, personal experiences, recommended supplement, etc. would be highly appreciated. :’)

My reaction is ""no"" to the surgery. At 16, she may not tolerate the anesthesia well and, if she survives, you might have to contend with canine dementia. That happened to my 15 YO girl who needed emergency surgery for an eye problem and she never came back mentally.

I would ask about steroid treatment. That can sometimes give a dog a few extra months with minimal risk.

,"Here’s the blunt truth.

The way you feel about your decision isn’t going to be based on medical fact.

It’s going to be based on if your dog lives longer or not.

When you lose your girl (which inevitably you will), you’re going to feel awful. Guilt and grief are toxic bedfellows, so if you pursue treatment and she passes, you’re going to feel guilty for putting her through it. If you pursue treatment and she does great, you’re going to feel like it was a great decision.

Same goes for if you don’t pursue aggressive treatment - how you feel will be directly tied to how much longer she lives.

What I hope you take away from this is that there is no wrong decision here, and that sucks because no wrong decision means there’s no clearly right thing to do. Make your decision with the information you have, and the goal of trying to keep her as happy as possible for as long as possible.

However, with how old and dainty your baby is… you really have to think about how she would recoup after that type of invasive surgery and would it be enhancing her life or possibly making it worse? I don’t know the answer, but I do know that if my dog was 16 at the time I would’ve definitely given it more time and thought. If I’m honest, I wouldn’t do it because like you said… you could have a few more beautiful years with your girl or you could do this surgery, only for them to possibly return.

,"Hey I’m so sorry. It’s a lot at once and I know you are going through it. One year ago today, I found out the mass removed from our boy’s liver was a cancerous mass (though we suspected as much since the mass was bigger than a softball). Feel free to DM me with questions, I will be radically honest. I don’t know if you’re in the US and in what region, but $900 is less than most chemo appointments my dog with cancer had (he passed less than a month ago). Ultrasounds + x-rays cost that much where I live and were a prerequisite to surgeries and continued chemo. I think we did at least half a dozen of those over the course of my boy’s treatment. Our costs all in with 2 major surgeries and vet care and check ins and chemo, etc were the price of a nice car. $900 was less than our monthly costs, but I’m sure we were at the high tier oncologist. (I know our surgeon was high tier, we tried for laparoscopic surgery but the mass was too large.) You have to separate the cost of surgery from the prep visits, check up, meds and chemo if those are going to be necessary. 

I don’t know what her prognosis is and her life expectancy. It’s troubling that your vet says the tumors have already metastasized - that’s would seem to be a thumb on the wrong end of the scale for surgical intervention. If she’s an energetic dog, you’re going to have to put her in a cone and keep her energy levels WAY low for two weeks post surgery or kinda keep her sedated so she won’t want to move. Like you’re going to have to scold her to stay still. Our boy wasn’t super active but he was on gabapentin after his two surgeries. Those two weeks are not good QOL weeks but depending on the dog, they can heal well and quickly. My dog did not seem to be in agony after his surgeries and was happy to be on his bed in the living room as we doted on him and brought him meals and snacks. He wasn’t a chewer of stitches so I could trust him without his cone for periods of time, but he did have two ancillary issues from being sedentary that caused delayed healing after a splenectomy (Jan 2023) and needed vet treatment. He felt worse after the liver tumor removal and stayed in hospital a couple extra nights but got a blood transfusion to improve his blood product levels and iron. No secondary infections then. Chemo was pretty easy, and started after the liver surgery to stop any further tumor formation.  2-4 days after his pill or injection, he’d feel a bit nauseous (not like a person though) and a couple times bc chemo tanks the immune system, he got a bug and had to get IV antibiotics to make him feel better again.  I can’t apples to oranges our dog’s treatment but the costs are not simply the one surgery. The specialist would need to tell you if they’d recommend some form of chem to hinder tumor growth and spreading. 

In the end, after being on chemo for about 6 months, some liver tumors popped up that were unimpeded by his chemo (his original liver tumors too small or awkwardly placed to surgically remove did respond well to chemo and shrank down). Those continued to grow and after a Hail Mary round of new chemo (didn’t budge the new tumors) we went into palliative care. He lived about 4 months after stopping the chemo. From what I could glean, it did metastasize to some facial tumors and his liver started breaking down. He had a good QOL until his last few days. 

If it is a metastasizing cancer that’s hard to heal post-surgery, knowing what I know now, if the additional life expectancy were not the greater part of a year, I would let her enjoy her life and spoil her rather than you going into debt, at some point having to make a financial decision too painful to make about her treatment, and having her time be filled with stitches, cones, meds, antibiotics, nausea, reduced participation in her loved activities, and frequent monitoring.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1g1dwma/advice_needed_16_year_old_female_dog_with_mammary/#lrfzznp,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Meet Oatis, my new roommate.
I adopted Oatis a week ago because I wanted to share my new home with someone. He’s the sweetest: doesn’t bark and loves being held.

I don’t know much of anything about where he came from. The rescue said he was a stray, but when I examine his mannerisms too hard it’s easy to think he didn’t come from the best home. 

I’ve never had a senior dog before so there is a few adjustments I need to make. He doesn’t bark, so it’s hard for me to know when he needs to go out. He doesn’t walk well, so I have to come up with new activities for him to do. And he just had a dental that took all of his (rotten) teeth, so getting used to new food and treats has been hard on him. 

I am lucky to have him, and my goal is to just spoil him as long as I can. Any advice and tips are appreciated!",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1iupwdc/meet_oatis_my_new_roommate/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My lovely boy is declining, but not fast enough to make this easy… could use advice.
My lovely boy is declining, but not enough to make this easy… could use advice.

I have an almost 11-year-old mini Schnauzer who went from the picture of health to starting having seizures exactly a year ago. For the first six months on Keppra he was thriving, nothing amiss, no seizures. He was diagnosed with Cushing’s, but that’s been very well treated and not a concern.

Then in February the honeymoon period ended and his seizures started coming in hard and fast every few weeks until he had a massive cluster two months ago that put him in the hospital for 4 days, and they got him on phenobarbital. 

Surprisingly, his first month on pheno was incredible, he was back to his old self, running, barking, playing! Then a month ago suddenly he lost all of his energy, and began pacing nonstop all day. 

Last week he had his first small breakthrough seizure, and since then he’s had inexplicable head tremors every time he wakes up for at least 20-30 minutes until he can walk around enough for them to stop. The tremors don’t respond to any medication, it’s likely IHTS. Doctors say given the Cushing’s and seizures, it’s likely a brain tumor.

Today he had another seizure, a big one. Two in one week on phenobarbital is a horrible sign.

Now he just paces all day. He can’t stay standing in place for more than 30 seconds or so, or he falls down from weakness, or starts having head tremors and needs to keep moving. He’s not in pain, but he’s not happy. He’s eating and drinking normally, and there’s still a little life in his eyes. I don’t think it’s his time to go yet, but it feels painfully close.

I feel like I’m just waiting for another massive cluster seizure, and while I don’t want to put him through that, it feels cruel to end it now while he’s still mobile and pain-free, even if he’s barely lucid. In the meantime, the tremors are heavily impacting his quality of life, and I’m heartbroken watching him pace the floor back and forth for hours and hours every day.

Just a month ago he was thriving, now it feels like he’s almost gone.",,https://i.redd.it/p7mdnktv84hd1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1elujvl/my_lovely_boy_is_declining_but_not_fast_enough_to/,,,,,,,,,,,,

The life of a dog is a sight to behold...

From the heavens above, loaned us these hearts of pure gold...

They hit the ground running, and barking with us....

For the joy we both share, builds an unbreakable trust...

The love from a dog is like candy from a box...

You're not sure what to pick, but there's never one wrong.

A dogs life with us is such a short, joyous trip...

But the life they share with us, is always our deepest friendship...

It hurts when they leave, because we always want more time...

Our dogs know their destiny...hence why they always play and pine...

So don't be bothered...when they come boop your hand... 

They just know their hour glass, is running out of sand.

Just look into those beautiful, sparkling eyes...you fell for before...

And get up and reach for that leash, hanging by the door. 

They'll enjoy that walk with you, even though they're hurt and can't see...

Because this time spent with you, is the place they long to be. 

So remember this when your dog asks for your time...

Your dog is just doing what heaven asked them to do...

And that's ...make your heart shine...

"Rocky crossed the rainbow bridge today 💔🐾🌈
(this is an update to my prior posts about his last days https://www.reddit.com/r/seniordogs/s/hpB2VKOu2J )

thank you so much to everyone who replied to my other posts here, and for all the thoughts and prayers for my boy. his last days were good until the very last one, when he just wanted to sleep. he passed this morning napping in his favorite sunny spot, right about at sunrise.

he was my first pup on my own as an adult, and I’m so grateful to have had him for almost five years (he was ~13-16 now, so I got him later in his life), but I just wish I had more. he had the silliest and sassiest personality, had the softest big ears and cutest spotted nose, absolutely loved being outside, and was the best companion, with me nearly 24/7 (including at work!). he got me through grad school, and I like to say he earned a doctorate himself because he was there every step of the way. he was my shadow, even opening the bathroom door to peek in, and I just loved him so incredibly much.

he’s alive (just sleepy!) for all the photos, except the one of us holding hands. that was one our last moments together before I finally said goodbye to his little body and let the vet take him. other photos include more beach naps, and different foods I let him try: fresh cooked steak and salmon, cookies, and a bit of my burrito. I slept near him as much as I could the last week we had together, and spent the days loving on him as much as he’d let me.

I’m hoping it’ll feel at least a little better to get his ashes back in a few weeks — because the house is so so empty right now, and I keep being in shock he’s not with me anymore. I miss him so much and it hasn’t even been 24 hours, and I just want him back so badly. 

if there’s anything you found helpful after losing your baby, especially to get through the first few days/weeks, I would be grateful for any advice because the pain is just so so awful

rest in peace my sweet baby, you deserved the world and I hope I was able to give you at least a good fraction of that in our time together ❤️

"In need of advice/help
I'm struggling very hard today. I have a 17.5 year old dachshund, Sam, whom I've had since he was 5 weeks old. We lost his brother/littermate, Ernie, less than 2 months ago, somewhat unexpectedly, after a seizure that just wouldn't stop. He died in my arms and I still struggle everyday with losing him. 

Since then, naturally, his brother has declined. Last year he was diagnosed with canine dementia and he also has a tumor on his belly that has grown fast and is constantly draining/bleeding. It doesn't not seem to bother him except when he's trying to get comfortable. It is getting harder to clean and keep dry. Surgery was an option, but not recommended due to his age. I agreed. Could be cancer, could be benign, but the vet is pretty sure it's cancer. 

His eating habits and bathroom habits have not changed, although he seems to demand more cookies these days, which he gets. ❤️ He sleeps atleast 18-20 hrs a day.

I came in the house the other day and I don't think he knew who I was. He no longer gets up to greet anyone who comes over. If he isn't sleeping or eating he is pacing, circling the dining room table, staring into space or non stop barking. 

Seeing him in this sharp decline is getting harder each day. He falls in the middle to high end of the quality of life scale. I believe I know what I need to do, and I cannot stand the though of him suffering even a little bit, but I'm struggling very bad with it. 

Any advice or help is greatly appreciated and thanks for reading. ",,https://i.redd.it/r573fz74r9id1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1eqjysk/in_need_of_advicehelp/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Advice for a Sundowner
Hi everyone, my 18 year old toy poodle Gary has been struggling to sleep at night which is seriously impacting my own sleep. He sleeps with me at night and refuses to sleep with anyone else or anywhere else. He wakes me up every hour and sometimes doesn’t even do anything but wander around, bringing him back to my room doesn’t do anything bc he keeps crying. 

I’ve tried a lot of things. Gabapentin, dog pheromones, soothing music (he’s basically deaf so it’s not like that does much), night light, heated blanket on low, CBD etc but nothing works.

He has a sensitive stomach so I don’t want to risk certain meds, he’s picky with food and wouldn’t eat chewy tablets, and I don’t want to put him down just because he makes it hard for me to sleep. He doesn’t seem to be in pain that I can tell and he’s fine otherwise besides the occasional episode here and there. He’s my baby and part of the family so I don’t want it to come to that, but I don’t know how much more sleepless nights I can take.

,"Only you know your dog and it sounds like he is still a happy boy. We were lucky to not have the sundowning happen at night, so I feel for you all going through that. 

What CBD is he on? Our boy had a sensitive stomach as well but he tolerated ElleVet very well. They have a great reputation on here too. He might also need more than his current dose. We’ve been giving our boy 2 pills twice a day, but then I realized that their instructions for using CBD for brain function actually was 3 pills twice a day. Just a thought!

For his dementia we also did Selegiline. I think this helped as well. It doesn’t have many side effects so it might be worth trying. 

I know people on here have also used trazadone and other anxiety medications for the pacing. Perhaps he could tolerate a low dose. 

Our boy was also on gabapentin for chronic pain. When he still was having bouts of shaking from pain and not being able to get comfy, the vet said most folks have to add galliprant to the mix to keep them comfortable. We started that as well (then really just used it as a back up) and that helped significantly. 

Another thing that helped tire my boy out and keep him busy was doing puzzles. He used to love toys, but lost interest. So we started doing snuffle mats and easy puzzles (ton on Amazon). If he’s done his puzzles, has a full belly, and has his CBD and gabapentin, he will usually rest for a good few hours.

,"Just solidarity here, because I highly suspect mine is sundowning/is showing dementia signs and it's so damn hard. He has a nerve issue which he takes Gabapentin for which does seem to help, but he doesn't have much of an appetite, so he's not getting it consistently since he's not eating consistently. 

But my old guy has started doing a lot of pacing at night, a lot of whining to go outside even though he was just out, and I've also recently noticed him standing in random places too (like today I found him in a bathroom, and he hardly ever goes in our bathrooms because they're both narrow and he's big and basically has to 3-point turn himself out). I'm also sleeping a lot less because he's up until the late hours pacing and whining and then it starts up again fairly early in the morning. 

Sometimes he'll pick up a toy and still want to play, and sometimes he seems like he's a million miles away. It's all fairly recent but seems to be progressing. He's my soul dog and I'm devastated.

,"We had 2 senior girls that we had to put down last year, and the year prior. It's such a tough decision! I always knew I would rather do it a day to early, than a day to late. With our first dog, it was clear it was time. She was 16, had doggie dementia, and couldn't do pretty much anything she enjoyed anymore (other than eat). Then one day she stopped eating, and it was an easy decision. For our second pup, she was 15, she went down hill quickly, and I wrestled with the decision for a week, putting her through vet visits, even though I knew in my heart it was time. I still regret that I didn't make the decision sooner, and that she suffered those last few days needlessly. Honestly, your pup's quality of life sounds quite low. This is the greatest gift you can give her, a peaceful passing with you by her side.

"Looking for outside perspective and non biased advice about my 17 year old Taco. 
I’ve had Taco since she was a puppy. I knew the day she was born and saw her often as a baby. She was my family’s first dog. I’ve had her since I was 17/18 and I’m now 36. She’s been by my side when I was happy, sick, sad and every other emotion. Fast forward to now, she’s mostly blind, mostly deaf, her back legs don’t work that well anymore. She still has most of her teeth, she eats and drinks like a champ. But that’s about it. She paces almost all day and paces all night. We’re almost positive she has doggie dementia. She pees in bed sometimes, pees and poops all over the house. She gets carried everywhere because she can’t use the stairs anymore. Her tail is always tucked and I haven’t seen in wag in awhile. I’m very conflicted because I think she’s ready to go, she’s not the dog I grew up with anymore. My sister says she’s still eating and drinking so she’s fine. I’ve never had to make this decision so I was hoping for some outside advice. I do have an appointment next week with her vet to see if there’s anything that would help her doggie dementia. I’m just so conflicted. ",,https://i.redd.it/tx29nelwojyd1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gi554u/looking_for_outside_perspective_and_non_biased/,,,,,,,,,,,,

We started our old gal on dementia meds and saw a big difference in her pacing! I think it’s called Segeline. Is your dog on any meds at all? Gabapentin also helped calm our girl when she wouldn’t stop doing laps around the house. 

Just yesterday, our vet gave us the news that it is time for our girl. It helped to hear it from a vet who we have used for a while and trust 100%. I hope you get some clarity from your vet.

He was so  quiet after, so i felt like he was still ok. Then he had another. The second one sent him to a place where he no longer knew his family and was afraid. It was devastating. The previous year we lost our 10yr old Springer to cancer. I put him to sleep when he could no longer swallow well. The difference between the two? The springer was smiling and still himself.

,"I’m so sorry you’re facing this incredibly difficult and painful decision right now. I haven’t read the other posts but I can tell you when dog is tucking it’s tail it’s usually from pain. They are unable to tell us when they are hurting so we’ve got to look for clues and the tail tuck is a pretty big one. Add to that the almost nonstop pacing and lack of strength in her back legs, and it unfortunately sounds like it’s time. 

Only you can decide this for her, but she’s sending out pretty strong signals that there are both mental and physical struggles going on. Letting them go isn’t only for when they are no longer eating and drinking, it’s setting them free from suffering or struggling and preventing an emergency situation where they’d be scared and stressed being rushed out to the ER vet to do it. 
😢 I’m so very sorry because I know exactly how difficult it is to face such a tough decision but sometimes it’s the kindest most loving thing we can do for them.

My soon to be 16yo in Nov Chihuahua Gypsy Rose has suddenly begun to want to stand at the top step like a mountain goat & leap off the top! This dog hurt her back about 3 years ago. A chiropractor saved her being put down & restored her dragging knuckling 2 back legs. Every time she does it my heart comes out of my throat. I have A-Fib & I'm disabled so I CANNOT grab her fast enough. When I tell her NO! She tries to jump from the top of my bed! We've lowered it as far as it will go. We're considering putting our mattress on the floor. She's fallen off from twirling she does when she's happy or doing Zoomies every night at bed time too. 

I was looking at ordering 2 or 3 of these rail guards before we throw out our $7,000 Sertapedic memory foam adjustable bed. I'll need to get my friend who sews to make some foam covers. My other senior Chihuahua Cricket Lee will be 15yo in Nov & is going blind from cataracts. She's fallen off a couple of times too from missing the steps in the dark so we sleep with an amber light on. If I'd known she'd go blind I'd have gotten her surgery done instead of buying this stupid bed. Good luck!

"need advice about my little man
hey everyone, so i need some advice. this is my lil old man Maxx, he’s turning 18 in a week (first pic most recent). 
he’s been having incontinence as of late and urinating in the house very often so i’ve gotten him diapers while i’m at home and able to change him. but i’m having to change him very often, even if i take him out for a 30 min walk he’s peeing in the house again 30 mins after we come inside. 

i keep him in his cage while i’m at work but he has to go out more often and i work full time 40+ hours a week. i’m not sure what to do at this point because when i come home he’s soiled his bedding and the pee pad i put down before i leave for the day. 
i don’t really have anyone to come in and take him out/watch him throughout the day, and i can’t hire anyone to do it because of financial reasons and because he’s wary of strangers, especially more so now that he’s almost blind and can’t hear that well. i live 30 mins away from my job so i can’t go back and do it during the day.

"Need advice
My sweet Susie girl is 17 1/2, and is almost always happy to cuddle, play and greet us at the door.  She has been having a hard time getting up from bed and pulls herself up with her front legs, but the back end gives at least once, and then she’s up.  Once up, she acts like nothing happened and putts around the house with my kids.  

Yesterday, my son came home and she was holding up her front paw and wouldn’t walk on it.  Given the state of her back end, she wouldn’t walk and would just sit down.  We took her to urgent care, X-rays with no fractures, all other systems are good, and diagnosed with a pinched nerve.  (Skeptical, but ok). She is bearing weight on it today but still clearly hurting and it’s so hard to watch.  

Our plan is to give it a few more days with medication and hope that the weight bearing improves, but we can’t let her be in pain.  She is better this morning, but we’re just worried this will keep happening and have to put her down in a hurry.  She is so loved by my little family, and she deserves to pass with dignity.

At the end of January we made the decision to let another of our dogs go, it was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but in retrospect I see I waited too long for his sake. Only you can judge the quality of life Susie has and I guess you just have to ask if you, yourself, would want to live like that.

"Looking for advice about my senior dog
I have an 11 year old German Shepherd who has had a history of health problems. I guess I'm looking at advice about knowing when it's time to make the hardest decision for her. 

She is on meds for pain management and has bad arthritis and a spinal disease. The last few weeks she has had trouble wanting to eat. She is still taking treats and special foods. But it's minimal and not wanting to have her regular wet and dry food. 

She has decreased energy and trouble getting up. She still wants to do short walks and gets up for the bathroom and water. She will sometime want to sit in front of the window or to come and say hello. 

At what point do I make the decision that it's time? I figured is she stops taking treats and starts losing control of bladder and bowels. Is there another reason to go sooner?

And in the end, we must grieve their loss in our own way.  The depths of grief are a direct reflection of the depths of love that you felt.  And the pain you feel is your heart turning your loss into memories.

,"My other half is almost 13 years old and also has issues with hip pain and a mass in his intestines... A few months ago, there was a time when he couldn’t walk anymore and had to start crawling. I began cooking meals for him and giving him glucosamine and chondroitin. Now he can walk again, and he loves his new diet. As long as he loves his food and gets up to go outside, I’ll do my best to keep him as comfortable as possible.

His diet includes:

* Boiled eggs and rice
* Rice and chicken
* Lentils and beef
* Beef liver
* Beef chest with potatoes (remove bones when serving)

His multivitamin and glucosamine/chondroitin always.

I recommend serving the food as simply as possible: aim for only 1 type of carb, 1 type of protein, and 1 type of fat in each meal, no more, no less. You can create your own dishes, but follow the same rule. The rice should be whole (brown) and soaked for 24 hours, just like the lentils.""

Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!

Hi! My dogs name is Pipa she is a nearly 16 year old mini schnauzer who recently developed arthritis. Is there anything you guys did for your pets or any supplements you gave them to help?

,"I used CBD oil with mine for CCD but it had the added benefit of also helping her arthritis. If you go the CBD route, make sure it's a reputable brand (like ElleVet) and you want full spectrum oil.  You add it to food to increase efficacy and give it every 8-12 hours, daily.  I saw the difference it made after about 2 weeks.  Getting the dosage right was tricky, but a holistic vet or some general vets can guide you.  Some of the companies have vets on staff to guide you and let you know if there are any interactions with current meds or supplements your dog may be taking.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1eu5si4/any_advice_for_dogs_with_arthritis/#liic7rv,,,,,,,,,,,,

,My vet started my baby on Adequan shots 2x a week for a month. Worked great!,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1eu5si4/any_advice_for_dogs_with_arthritis/#lijii0m,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"We’ve been dealing with OA for around 2 years now. Here’s what our boy is on:

- Dasequin chews (loading dose then maintence dose). A lot of people swear by supplements like these but we didn’t see much change unfortunately. We’ve stayed on them but not sure it’s been more to him than a very expensive daily delicious treat.

- fish oil. He’s been on this for ages for other reasons too so idk how much it’s doing or not but it’s cheap so 🤷🏼‍♀️

- Galliprant. It’s expensive but our veterinarian recommended it as the safer option of NSAID to be on and we definitely saw improvement with this. Long term NSAID use has its risks but as long as he keeps doing well and we don’t have a viable replacement he’s going to stay on it, the reduction in pain and inflammation is worth the risk. 

- Adequan injections. These have helped a lot, it’s a pain to bring him in monthly but they bought us about a year and change of good functionality.  We plan to stay on these for the rest of his life.

- our Dr gave us a script of Gabapentin to have on hand for bad days. I recommend tracking your dogs symptoms and days if possible so that you can get an idea of what her triggers are for flare ups to help prevent/get ahead of them, monitor for unexplained changes, etc.

- Acupunture. We’ve only JUST started this and jury is still out. Some swear by it, I’m a skeptic but figured it couldn’t hurt. Maybe it’s helping? Maybe it’s placebo? Idk

- Cold laser, this can be divisive as well. Same reason for trying as acupuncture, I figured why not give it a whirl. Clinical evidence on efficacy isn’t strong however…

We have been waiting on Librela but we likely will end up trying it fairly soon, as we have noticed some significant progression lately. I’ve been DEEPLY researching Librela for literally months now (not a veterinary professional tho) and here’s where I’m at with it, everyone can take or leave my opinion as they see fit:

1. Osteoarthritis is a progressive disease and while yes, Librela doesn’t directly treat the physical nature of it, nothing can truly halt its progression. Some other treatments slow it, but it will progress in all dogs still.

2. Librela IS contraindicated for neurological issues, which can sometimes be hard to catch. Anyone considering it should ask their doctor about making sure there aren’t any signs of neurological problems in their dog. There are also risks of urinary issues, again a risk to be weighed.

3. There are MANY people with horror stories online about it. I’ve read through plenty. I think it’s important to remember that when we look at self reported adverse effects from this (or any) drug, that these are going to have varying degrees of accuracy, influence of other factors, etc. Some seem to be quite clearly connected (immediate reaction to the injection perhaps indicating an allergy or intolerance, adverse effect that aligns with known issues like neurological or urinary, etc). Others maybe aren’t as clear but show a pattern that we may see a connection with further study down the road. However there have been some I’ve read where I think it’s really a stretch to blame Librela for what happened to their dog, or at the very least there’s no indication that the two are connected in any way.

Remember that Librela is being given primarily to elderly dogs. And as anyone who’s had elderly dogs knows, decline or illness can sometimes happen extremely quickly and with little warning ahead of time. Dogs are excellent at hiding pain or may exhibit odd/subtle symptoms we don’t recognize. They may also suddenly go from no symptoms at all to dire very quickly. The same can happen in humans.

So when you have a medication being VASTLY disproportionally given to geriatric dogs, yeah a lot of those dogs are going to pass away suddenly and perhaps not long after simply by chance/something that would’ve happened either way. And when owners are googling Librela and see other horror stories it can be easy to make a connection where perhaps there’s really not evidence for one besides circumstantial. 

And I don’t mean this to sound like I’m flippant or blaming those who end up making such connections. They’re deep in grief, and seeing frenzy online around Librela can often lead them to self blame thinking that THEY may have caused their 15 year old boxers life to be “cut short” when in reality they should be congratulated for caring so well for their boxer that it made it to the IMPRESSIVE age of 15! It makes me sad that I think there’s a lot of people feeling unneeded guilt over trying to do their best to make their dogs last days comfortable. 

Now ALL of that said, we are still holding off on Librela a bit because our dog has some chronic issues and we were advised by our doctor to wait on it until we were further down the line in regards to his quality of life. We also consulted with his specialists he sees for these issues and they weren’t able to give us clear answers. We are awaiting some information from one of their contacts in Europe, where Liberla has been out and in use substantially longer.

But when we get to the point of it being a question of a degrading of his quality of life that’s outweighing the potential risks… we’re going to try it. I’ve seen enough positive stories to not want to leave it on the table when it could buy him some better quality time (even if it does mean shorter quantity of time, although we made that decision on some other things long ago already).

I just encourage everyone to remember that there’s a balance between healthy skepticism of drugs presented as “miracles with no side effects” and healthy skepticism of free-for-alls of horror stories on the internet. This goes for pretty much any medication or treatment tbh… canine or otherwise. The truth is usually somewhere between the two, and finding it means not taking everything at face value (from either side).


ETA: I almost forgot one of the most important ones! Staying active! Our boy has always been an avid walker since day one, but of course we’ve had to gradually shorten and slow down his routine over the years here. But even some is better than nothing, the very few times he’s had to be cooped up for longer periods (multi day polar vortexes and the like) he got much more stiff after just a day or two of the drastic reduction in physical activity. He’s having a hard time bouncing back from a flare up right now because he lost some muscle mass in his back legs from the week-long reduction in activity (which as they age it can be harder to maintain that muscle I’m sure). Keeping up activity but learning your dogs limits (and signals that she’s nearing her limit, so she doesn’t over do it) will help her stay moving better longer ❤️",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1eu5si4/any_advice_for_dogs_with_arthritis/#liocpt3,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hey all, this is my senior girl, Sunny!

She’s around 15/16, she’s pretty healthy and happy other than pretty bad arthritis in her hips, which is consistently being treated + vitamins. Recently, within the past 2 months she has been having accidents inside. Nothing about her diet/meds/vitamins have changed, She’s never done this her whole entire life she’s always been very good about letting us know she has to go, plus we’re always on a schedule and she’s never had a problem until recently.

It’s usually when we leave, like even for just an hour, we come home and she’s peed in the floor. Even if we had just been on a walk. Of course I’m frustrated about cleaning it up, but how could I get mad at her when she’s just a sweet little lady who had an accident. But this just started out of nowhere almost every day. It happened TWICE today and we have CARPET, please someone help lol

"Just looking for some support
I posted 2 weeks ago about my old girl not doing well and thinking that it might be time to let her cross over rainbow bridge. Since then she has declined quite a bit. She has severe arthritis and it’s at the point where she has a hard time even lying down and getting comfortable. When we’re not home, she has gotten stuck on the floor unable to get up for god knows how long. Last night, I scheduled her euthanasia for next Friday, but I think I just need to be strong and do it today if they are able to take her. It’s so heart wrenching watching her suffer. I probably already dragged things out longer than I should have. 

Since my last post I’ve gotten her cbd and she’s been on rimadyl, I thought it was helping but last night and today so far have been rough for her. I bought her a brace for her back legs and it should be coming in the mail today, but at this point I don’t even think it it’s worth putting her through the stress of getting it on her. 

Of course, I’m thinking so many what ifs. I wish I started the cbd earlier or gotten her the leg brace sooner. She was on librela and I regret having her get it so much. I really think it accelerated her decline. I have so much guilt for that. 

As I’m typing this, my vet said they are able to take her tonight. I know I’m the only one who can really answer this but does it sound like I’m making the right choice?

,"So sorry, some perspective. There are two days that define our impact on a pup’s life: the day we bring them into their forever home and the day we bear the burden of letting them go. 
Our responsibility is simple: to give them a home, security, comfort, and love. We might get caught up in life, busy with routines and obligations, but to them, every day we’ve been their whole world. Every moment, every second, minute, or hour, they look to us for joy, for comfort. They are noble and loyal. They never had a bad day at work that kept them from giving us their best. They never stressed over bills and gave us half-hearted attention. Every single day, they gave us everything they had.
In return, we bear the weight of one single day—the day we let them rest. Their duty was love, and they fulfilled it unconditionally, every waking moment of their lives. Whether it was missing us when we were gone or taking up the whole bed, they loved us with all their might.
So, on that day, give them everything you can, just as they did for you every day before. We carry the pain and the loss, and it doesn’t go away. It’s been four years since I let my boy go, and it still hurts as I write this.

"I think it may be time and I’m heartbroken
My husband and I rescued a senior husky 2 years ago. She was really old when we got her, unsure of her exact age, but I’d say she’s around 14 now. I know we are lucky to have had 2 years with her, but this dog is literally my baby. She’s slowed down over the past 6 months and just recently she’s gotten worse. She cries when trying to lay down and sometimes has a hard time getting up and gets stuck. It’s so hard to watch. Two days ago she was honestly doing good and I did some research and made a physical therapy appointment for this coming Monday. Between two days ago and now she’s gotten way worse. I think she might have a UTI because she’s showing the symptoms of one. I was able to get a vet appointment for her this afternoon. I’m just not sure if I should go about treating the uti and if it helps try the physical therapy or if it’s just a lost cause and I should just let her go before things get worse.

Have a massage/spa day.   Delicious food and more delicious foods!   Read stories out loud.  Watch favorite dog movies and take naps together.  If you can still take walks get out there as much as you can.  Play dress up together.  Sing songs and just spend time doing whatever feels right.   Get a small notebook and write down everything you do that is special, and how you feel about it.  Document these last moments together for your memory bank.  You won't regret it.  And when the time is right, know you are doing  the right thing.

"Need Advice, Please
We have a 14 (almost 15) year old Puggle who up until recently has been amazing going up and down our stairs. A few months ago, she started showing some signs of canine dementia, resulting in her going up and down the stairs in a constant loop. In order to protect her, we started blocking the stairs. Being the Houdini she is, she constantly figures out a way around it and ultimately has fallen down the stairs a couple of times due to her being about 80% deaf and blind and now a little demented. As such, she is now terrified to go down the stairs on her own which results in pooping and peeing upstairs by the bedrooms and on our stairs. I’m 5.5 months pregnant and cannot lift her and my husband has to go on overnights for work, leaving me with the dogs on my own. Typically not a problem, but obviously much more of a challenge these days and likely only going to become more challenging as time goes on. 

I’m not sure what to do here. I’ve looked into ramps for the stairs, but there aren’t any that will span the entirety of our stairs. I feel bad leaving her downstairs at all times while we and the other dog go to bed. Any suggestions here? She’s even having trouble going down the 3 steps out of our porch into the yard.

"Need help with burial advice
My love has been diaganosed with a trigeminal nerve sheath tumour. 

Don't know how long she has left and am stressing about how/where to bury her

I do not like the idea of cremation as she hates the heat, am sceptical that it's actually your dog's ashes you receive

Also the idea that she will be just outside in the garden is comforting

My garden soil has some clay, wet and seem to be lots of worms in it. I am not sure if it is well draining soil or not

Does anyone know what is the process of burial and do I need to add anything into her grave to help with decomposition?

Ideally I would like to dig her bones up in years to come, in case I ever sell or want her put in my casket as I don't want leave her behind

I read it can take decades for a dog to decompose in non well draining soil, so I am really stressed about how to go about this

My partner suggested burying her in a huge stone pot and planting a tree on top, but been told this is a bad idea and will cause smell and can't decompose well in a pot

Any advice or experiences with burial would be greatly appreciated

",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1if59j0/need_help_with_burial_advice/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"First, try digging a hole in your backyard, where you want her buried. If you can manage to dig a hole about 3 feet deep, examine the dirt.

If it’s soft and crumbly with sand and small rocks then you’re probably fine to go ahead with a direct burial.  If it’s dense, like clay, and muddy then you probably have poor drainage. 

A solution would be to dig deeper (about 4 ft) then add a 3” layer of gravel, then a few inches of sand to cover the gravel. Now, after putting the dog’s body in the hole, I’d probably cover it with more sand and gravel, before filling it in with the original dirt. Top the grave with heavy rocks to prevent wild animals from digging it up. 

I’ve buried several dogs in Southern California soil (clay mixed with sandstone) with no problem. (But admittedly, I never tried to dig them up.)

You want to dig deep enough because the body will swell after burial, with potentially disturbing results if she’s not buried deep enough. A three foot deep hole will fit most dogs.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1if59j0/need_help_with_burial_advice/#madeeat,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lost my best friend yesterday 
My husband and I said goodbye to our best friend yesterday. I adopted her when I was 22, just out of college and needing a companion. Five years ago, she was diagnosed with lymphoma, which we were fortunate to discover early and treat with chemotherapy. We celebrated her 12th birthday three and a half weeks ago, and she basically stopped eating. Two vets visits produced little feedback except that her platelets were very low, and other organs were starting to get impacted. I returned from an overnight work trip last week and she didn’t come to the door, or pick up her head when I walked up to say hello. We took her to the ER that night where they confirmed there was fluid around her heart, a heart murmur, some mild internal bleeding, and a mass spotted on her abdomen. We hospitalized her overnight, but she didn’t get any better. We had an oncology appointment booked for this week, but I couldn’t bear the agony of watching her suffer so we let her go yesterday morning. Even though I know we did the right thing, the guilt is absolutely insurmountable. I appreciate any advice. She will be missed endlessly.

"My sweet senior dog is going through it… advice? 
Help! My sweet 10.5yo Husky is having such a tough time adjusting to some big changes in our lives. 

We always wanted another dog to keep him company, but for years my husband and I lived in an apartment and it just didn’t make sense. In 2022 we finally bought a house with a big back yard, and in 2023 we adopted a second Husky! 

It wasn’t until we got the new puppy that we realized how old he has gotten. Seeing him around the puppy was a big wake up call- he was low energy, a little grumpy, and didn’t want anything to do with the puppy. He began resource guarding his food. We started feeding the dogs separately, and all was well for a while. 

This summer, we welcomed a new baby into the family (a human baby). With all the changes, his resource guarding got 100000x worse. We can’t have dog toys out anymore, because he will take one into our bedroom and fiercely guard it all day long. He even neglects tasks like going potty outside and drinking water because he wants to stay and guard his toy. 

Now that toys are removed, he finds other things to guard like socks out of the hamper. 

How can we help to make his quality of life better? He doesn't even really enjoy walks anymore! I want to make these last years of his life meaningful 💙🥺",,https://i.redd.it/0lx6pn715f9e1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1hniq35/my_sweet_senior_dog_is_going_through_it_advice/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I really think you need to get a dog behaviouralist to help you with this. 
There has been a lot of change and that can be really destabilising, especially for a senior dog.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1hniq35/my_sweet_senior_dog_is_going_through_it_advice/#m4217ko,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I admire your dedication to your boy's well-being amidst all these life changes. It’s clear how much you care about him, and it’s great that you’re looking for ways to improve his quality of life.

His behavior sounds like a mix of stress from the new additions to his world (the puppy, the baby) and age-related changes that can amplify his need for security and predictability. Dogs often resource guard more when they feel their environment is less stable or when they’re struggling to adapt to big changes.

Some ideas...

Create a safe space by designating a quiet, cozy area in your home that’s just for him. It could be a bedroom corner or a comfy crate where he can retreat when he needs a break from the puppy or the baby. Stock it with his bed and maybe some low-value items (things he enjoys but isn’t likely to guard fiercely).

Modify interactions with the puppy by keeping their interactions calm and structured. Avoid situations where your older Husky might feel challenged, like sharing high-value treats or toys. It sounds like you're already managing this well by removing toys, but supervised, positive one-on-one time between them could slowly rebuild trust.

Enrich his life without overwhelming him. If he’s not enjoying walks, consider shorter, slower ones or substitute with mental enrichment like scent games, puzzle toys, or gentle training exercises. These can be low-stress ways to keep him engaged.

It might be worth consulting a veterinary behaviorist or a trainer who uses positive reinforcement techniques. They can help address the guarding behavior and reduce his stress levels.

Since he’s older, it’s a good time to check in with your vet or a holistic vet about pain management or supplements that might help with any age-related discomfort. Sometimes, feeling better physically can lead to improved behavior.

It’s okay if he’s no longer interested in being super active or playful. Focus on activities that he does enjoy, even if it’s just quiet time with you or lounging in the yard.

Your boy's world has changed a lot in the past couple of years, but with time, patience, and a few adjustments, he can feel more secure and loved. You’re already on the right track just by noticing his needs and wanting to make his golden years meaningful. There needs to be more loving and thoughtful dog owners like you in the world.  🧡",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1hniq35/my_sweet_senior_dog_is_going_through_it_advice/#m426mzs,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please pet me some more, and pick me right up...

My very first thought when I was your pup...

I gonna miss your funny *boops* and our ""find me Luuuuuucy"" games.

It warmed my heart so, to hear you call out my name. 

You're the love of my life, my partner in joy...

My favorite noise in this house...my hearts best toy ...

I wish I could stay longer, and grow older with you... 

But the sand in my hourglass, is sadly down to a few...

Just know I loved doing everything together...even howling in tune.

In your truck, on the couch, and the long walks under our moon...

My puppy heart wants to stay, but this ole girl's body says it's time...

From the hurt in my bones, to the clouds in my eyes.

To feel your touch once more...says your love is still mine...

To feel your hands cup my face,

"Advice on my senior dachshund
Hello Reddit, I have a 14 year old senior dachshund who I’ve noticed in the past year has lost his active doggy energy. His health is in good shape he’s just getting old sadly, so I was recommended to try a CBD oil for senior dogs for joint and overall  health or is there anything anyone can recommend? I’m a broke teenager and can’t really afford anything that expensive so my budget is $40-75 thanks community ",,https://i.redd.it/jaovr25mqn1d1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1cwscav/advice_on_my_senior_dachshund/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"People recommend CBD oil for pain or anxiety. Slowing can be a sign if pain.

If it's pain, then just get a prescription from your vet for a basic pain killer/anti-inflammatory like carprofen or gabapentin. You can take the script to a human pharmacies and use human drug discounts. These meds are about as expensive than buying a bottle of Advil for yourself (don't buy Advil for your dog. Ask your grandma - seniors sometimes take Advil or Tylenol everyday as they get older to help with general aches.) It's definitely cheaper than supplements you'll get in the holistic dog market. Your vet appointment may cost a bit. But your vet can also check your dogs joints and mobility for signs of pain. Some vets may recommend what appear to be holistic medicines in the human market, but are actually considered mainstream veterinary medicine. CBD oil very much falls into both holistic human meds and holistic veterinary meds. Most vets will not recommend using it and it's not well regulated. 

I think I spent 20-35$/month on basic pain meds for my dog? And he was 4-5x your dog's weight, so he took a lot more pills than you would need.

If it's not pain.... I would switch your dog to good senior kibble - some kibble brands include things like fish oil and glucosamine/chrondrotin, which people buy supplements for separately. Your kibble may be more expensive, but you'll save overall on buying the supplements independently.

Or consider buying a few cheap rugs/runners or dog stairs so your dog does not injure itself as it ages. Saving your dog from having to make lots of jumps will save you a lot of vet bills and strained muscles as your dog ages.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1cwscav/advice_on_my_senior_dachshund/#l59r4ws,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My 12 year old dog has been diagnosed with cancer and I am not sure how to handle this.  Do I do surgery or make him comfortable? Any advice?
 had my dog since 2013. I was 23 when I got him. I’m 35 now. He is my best friend. He is a hound mix that is about 77lbs. He is in mostly good health except for his hip, it might be on its way out in a year or two. We have traveled the country together, move to and from another country together. He’s been there through every break up and depression spell. He’s been my backpacking buddy, favorite roadtrip companion, and the most consistent thing in my life. He has been more like family than most of my family has. I have given him the best life I can possible imagine. We walk 3-5 miles everyday. We go hiking and camping and on road trips. He is 12. He was diagnosed with cancer on his anal sac. It’s very small and I can do surgery but the surgery will cost 10k plus follow up appointments. I am absolutely heartbroken. The emotional part of me is saying yes, do whatever it takes to keep him here as long as he can be. I love him to much and the thought of him not being with me just puts such a heavy rock in my chest. I have been crying on and off for a couple weeks now. We are actually visiting another country right now on a little roadtrip. The logic side of me is that he might out live his cancer and die of something else, he is old and spending over half of my savings or taking out debt is just fiscally irresponsible. There is no guarantee it doesn’t come back, no guarantee that he doesn’t have to do chemo, no guarantee that this treatment would actually lengthen his life but a just in case. But I feel like I owe him everything I have, and I have given him everything thus far. I’m feeling so lost. My partner is the most supportive in either of my decisions to we will find the money to he’s lived an amazing life because of you. I’m having a hard time coming to the conclusion that his life might be coming to an end and I don’t want to be emotionally sparatic with my decisions or being selfish. I don’t know. 

I guess I’m here to ask those who have had a senior dog with cancer, what did you do? How did you come to this decision? What was the outcome? Do you have regret ? 

Any advice is welcome.

,"My vet quoted a $10k surgery to me for my guy when he was 16 years old and I decided not to do it. Not only was it financially overwhelming, but I wasn’t sure that the surgery itself would actually bring him enough quality of life— he was an old guy already, putting him through that was questionable at best.

I told my vet that I wanted to start treating his symptoms instead of trying to cure him (he had early stages of several cancers) and my vet was very supportive. His last year’s focus was on of keeping him comfortable and keeping his quality of life high, and I’m glad for that.

He died in late 2023; started to have seizures and was in pain and it was time. I got him in 2006, when I was 22, and he died when I was 39. He saw me through several lifetimes.

Weirdly, it was easier to make the decision when it was time because I had done the surgery. There wasn’t anything left to do - I’d already done it for him.

You might try looking up his cancer and understanding the prognosis. If your vet hasn’t done a cytology, ask for one. They’re easy on your boy and results come back within a week. If it’s an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, that might be a different decision than one that’s cured by surgery.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ia7qdw/my_12_year_old_dog_has_been_diagnosed_with_cancer/#m99g6am,,,,,,,,,,,,

For both of them I let them tell me when it was time. My one from last Friday didn’t tell me, instead he showed me by stopping eating, refusing to drink, & overall basically indicating that he was done. His brother wasted away in front of my eyes before showing me he was ready to go.

I looked at their quality of life & if they were living for Me or if they were Actually doing ok. In both cases, they were not doing ok.

,"My dog Sophia was diagnosed a couple of weeks ago with a cancer that is in her sinuses. She is around 9 or 10. We go in for an oncology assessment in 3 days. Soph is a mess, she's had 2 TPLOs, a big Lipoma removed, several busted teeth from her life before we adopted her, one really worn down canine tooth, allergies to chicken, turkey and grass. She needs her anal glands expressed almost monthly. I adopted her from the rescue shelter only 4 years ago. She has brought me love and her eccentric, independent character. I could not love her more. Her cancer manifests symptoms that cause her to sneeze alot and a fast growing tumor on her forehead. The biopsy revealed it is fast growing and aggressive. My vet advised to put her down, rather than treat it because of the type of cancer.

We are not wealthy. But I decided that if the nearby university animal hospital oncology group WILL AGREE TO ACCEPT HER, that we will try to treat her. This facility is known to be very expensive, but we dont live near many other choices for oncology. My decision is based on my disappointment in losing her. She is not miserable now, so I want to give us more time together. Soph is a fantastic travel buddy and a kind, patient dog.

If she developed a more sudden problem that was overwhelming, I could gratefully help her pass. My devotion to her physical well being is high, my empathy for her discomfort is high. We are going to treat her, if they'll let us. Afterwards,  I will monitor her quality of life and be ready when she must go. I'm going to help her, if I can. When I can't help her - or if they say this is too aggressive to treat - I will help her one last time.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1ia7qdw/my_12_year_old_dog_has_been_diagnosed_with_cancer/#m9a4os4,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Advice on helping dog sleep all night
Hi hi! My Silly girl is 16 1/2 years old and is the sweetest thing. I work odd hours and get up around 2:30 am M-F. Silly typically sleeps and doesn’t get up until 12-2:30 am to go pee. If she gets up before 2:30, then she does her business, gets a quick drink of water, and goes back to sleep with me. Or when I get up for work, she’ll go back to sleep on the couch. 

She was just taken off phenobarbital because the side effects were too much and making her get up 2-3 times each night and pacing a lot before wanting to go back to bed. She is somewhat back to her normal sleep cycle of getting up between 12:30-2:30 with me. Silly used to sleep right through the night. Is there anything to help her sleep through the night? Or is she just like any old lady who has to get up to pee in the middle of the night? 😂😂 thank you ☺️ ",,https://i.redd.it/2rqbso7dkhie1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1imvh6i/advice_on_helping_dog_sleep_all_night/,,,,,,,,,,,,

She doesn’t pace at night anymore; hardly wakes up in the middle of the night and, when she does, she goes right back to sleep. It’s pricey, but imo, totally worth it.

"Tomorrow I’ll put down my princess, 
My baby Princess ☹️💔 she’s a shihtzu, would be turning 15years old this October but dementia took away her happiness. It’s been a year since we started noticing changes in her behavior, and she already had problems with her hips. We took her to the vet on march since she was already looking very sad, and we couldn’t see her like that, also was making things harder for us since she was always dirty because she would piss and poop and go over it accidentally, we needed to wash her almost everyday, and she couldn’t eat well, she would make a mess and stumble in the water, making it dirty as soon as we change it to clean. She had a wound in her head from hitting herself in walls and stuff when pacing around since she was blind. but the vet asked if could still walk to her plate to eat and drink and since she could, she told us to wait until she doesn’t…  and tbh I felt bad for asking the vet if it’s time so i didn’t insist her that she wasn’t having quality of life, also she saw her, I don’t know why she didn’t see how sad she looked, I now think that she was ready by that time… now This month it’s been the worst she had ever been, I think she has suffer a lot. Now she’s skinny, seems like she has been making a mess with her food rather than eating well and enough, so she lost weight. I couldn’t see because of her hair but yesterday I noticed she was so weak, and decided  call the vet because she seems to be suffering a lot. I groomed her and saw how skinny she is getting and I definitely know it’s time. she can’t barely stand anymore and I have to help her stand to drink or eat, otherwise she can’t do it on her own. She also can’t walk, looks so stressed and sad. We had to keep her in the playpen because she would get stuck every time when she’s pacing around. She would cry while pacing at night. She would be HOURS walking and walking and crying, it’s so sad.

"My girl is 11.5 and still as spry as ever! Question regarding behavior below.
This is our senior girl. She is still very spry, no problems getting up or down, jumps up and down from things (I try to limit this but she does what she wants sometimes lol) and overall very healthy for her age. However, she seems to be almost reverting back to some puppy behaviors, mainly pushing boundaries and generally a lot more communicative than she used to be. She hates being left outside these days, she use to sunbath and enjoyed being outside a few ours of the day but that’s not the case anymore unless I’m outside with her. She is the first senior dog I’ve ever cared for myself (childhood dog was a senior and passed away when I was away in college so I missed a lot of her behavioral changes as she aged). I’m curious if y’all saw changes like this as your pups aged? I guess just generally more separation anxiety and neediness? I don’t mind adjusting to make sure she’s continuing to be a happy girl just curious about how things will continue to change as she gets older.

As far as behavioral changes, that’s pretty common with an aging dog, but doesn’t mean it isn’t difficult.

He also suffered from sun-downers which I would recommend looking into just in case. If she is a beagle, pushing boundaries, being more communicative and being more clingy all sound pretty expected.

,"She may be starting to show changes in cognitive health, as they typically do start to present around age 11-13, albeit it very subtle. It could also be that her senses are declining (sight/hearing, which also in turn exacerbate the onset of CCD).  My girl did this around age 12-13...became more clingy in the sense that she needed to know she wasn't alone in the house, but she didn't necessarily want us to handle her either (which was off, because she used to LOVE interaction with us). Up until that age, she had no issues being home alone for 8-9 hours a day when we worked. She also stopped sunbathing. Started having separation anxiety again.  She pushed boundaries and started to forget all her previous training/obedience/commands. Unfortunately, I did not realize it was CCD (Canine cognitive dysfunction aka Doggy Dementia) until around age 14.5-15. She is now 16 and deep in the late stages of CCD...her time with us is sunsetting, as her quality of life has declined drastically, even though physically she is closer to a dog that is much younger. I wish I had noticed the changes earlier instead of brushing them off as senior dog quirks.

I'm not saying your sweet lady will get CCD, but it often starts with very subtle signs that are almost undetectable. If you can afford to do so, I would pre-emptively start a cognitive supportive regiment. Consider adding omega fatty acids to her food (e.g. nordic naturals fish oil, or Welactin). Sam-e is also a supplement that helps with liver function and brain function. Talk to your vet about potentially switching her over to a brain diet (e.g., purina bright minds, or perscription purina pro NC, or Perscription Hill's Science B/D). Consider supplements like senilife, or zesty paws cognitive bites. Most importantly, more than anything money can buy, try to keep her stimulated and engaged mentally and physically...take her out on those walks, let her play with food puzzles, do training sessions with her again...these are all things I wish I did earlier, and unfortunately did not start until she really started showing mental decline. I regret not catching it sooner, and although I don't know how much would have changed if I had, I still make it my effort to educate others now so that they hopefully have an easier time than I did when navigating the uncertainty of CCD .  If you would like more info, once of the best resources is Eileen Anderson's Book ""Remember Me? Loving and Caring for a dog with Canine Cognitive Dysfunction.""  You can find a lot of her info for free posted on her website [https://dogdementia.com/](https://dogdementia.com/)

This is the 2nd dog I've had with CCD. The first was my family dog, and I was away for grad school when he really started declining in his mental health, so I missed the bulk of the changes and only saw him later when he was a different dog entirely.  I thought I would notice it better with my current dog, but again, the changes were so subtle that it still snuck up on me. Best of luck. I really don't mean to scare you, but I just want you to be aware of the possibility.

"I had to send my Gypsy Rose over Rainbow Bridge this morning...
Yesterday she turned 16. She suffered her first ever seizure of 10 seconds. She was left with a small head tic & seemed confused & was stumbling around in a daze for about 20 minutes. Then it cleared & she went on like nothing had happened. I believed it was her heartworm meds coupled with a 4/5 heart murmur. The last 2-3 X I gave her her monthly heartworm med it knocked her down but she always bounced back.
I called her vet. They said at her age she's prime to have mini strokes/seizures from her heart murmur or diabetes. She'd need about a thousand $ worth of testing & meds which we don't have. My hubby has a severe heart murmur & I have 6 autoimmune conditions plus A-Fib.  We BOTH need tests run. I had already done the quality of life test for Gypsy Rose. She scored really low. I made an appointment for Monday to see him.
Gypsy Rose ate 6 small meals & snacks yesterday. Ran zoomies going to bed after 9pm. At 11pm she had a 15 min longer more terrible seizure. It resolved but she was whining, barking non stop, agitated, panting profusely & again confusion with stumbling gait but no head tic. It resolved after about 15 min.
I decided to take her in Saturday to our weekend vet that we used to euthanize her big brother my Soulmate Chihuahua 3 years ago Labor Day. My hubby resisted this morning. She seemed better to him. He went to work. She ate & walked around fine. Then she had a less severe seizure at 10:40. She was whining, crying loudly & wanting me to hold her in my lap while barking loudly in my ear none of which is her normal behavior! I called my hubby because I can't drive. We were able to get in to send her over the Rainbow Bridge at 11:30am. I'm broken-hearted & devastated but I know I'll see her again. My last 2 Chis visited me the same night they passed over.
Let this be a valuable lesson to any who think there's always tomorrow. Love your furbaby like there's no tomorrow! Plan early - plan carefully for your beloved furbaby! I had planned to use Laps of Love. I had contacted them but failed to follow through. I have one senior Chihuahua Furbaby left from my original 4 pack of Chis who turned 15yo yesterday but didn't even get anything. We were too upset & distraught over Gypsy Rose.

"Senior dog evening behavior driving me crazy
I have a Lhasa pup who is about to turn 16 years old. He is actually 75% Lhasa and 25% Pomeranian. He’s losing his vision and experiencing tracheal collapse issues. He is on a small amount of Temaril-P daily, which my vet and I decided is helping more than the long-term side effects would harm him. I take him on an hour-long walk almost every day, and we both look forward to it. Most people think he’s much younger when they see him, so in that regard, he is doing well for his age.

During the day, when not on a walk, he’ll sleep in his bed or perch on top of the couch so he can keep watch outside (especially when I am away) or let himself outside through the doggie door in the backyard. Totally normal behavior.

However, when the sun goes down, it’s a different story. I feed him some fresh food every evening around 6 p.m. About 30 minutes to an hour after that, he constantly stares at me and whines. If I am on the couch watching TV or reading, he comes out and stands right in front of me, staring and whimpering. I can shoo him away or pick him up and put him on the couch, but it doesn’t last long before he does it again. When I get up, he runs to the kitchen, hoping I’m going to give him another treat.

He is already 13 pounds and really should be more like 11. I can’t let him gain more weight because it worsens his tracheal issues. I have had to reduce his food and treat intake overall, and I know the Temaril-P probably makes him more hungry, but it’s not like I used to give him a lot of treats at night and suddenly stopped. He acts like he hasn’t been fed all day.

Of course, Lhasas can be very stubborn and demand a routine, but this is through the roof. I believe it to be cognitive decline or sundowning syndrome, but it is driving me crazy, and I don’t know what to do. He won’t stop.

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Sometimes, I have to leave the house just to get a break. I really feel for him, but he just wants more treats, and he has already had enough—had his exercise for the day and his normal food.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1j522nd/senior_dog_evening_behavior_driving_me_crazy/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I definitely sympathize with you.  As I write this, I have a 16 y/o poodle mix who's walking the floor.  It's 2:00 in the morning.  I'm just grateful she's not a barker.  She's lost her hearing, her eyesight isn't great, but she's a different dog when it's mealtime.  That's her time to jump around like a 3 year old dog, paw at my legs to make me hurry up and that's when she attempts to play with the other dogs.  She's kind of special when it comes to that.  All she knows how to do is jump at them, usually towards their face.  They're not quite sure what to do with her.  She's kind of an oddball.  LOL.  

I'm sure the Temaril-P is adding to his hunger.  I worked for vets for 25 years.  My older dogs started CHF (congestive heart failure) coughing and I was constantly told it was tracheal collapse.  Luckily I was able to start my old babies on furosemide (to help with fluid build up) and, contrary to what I was being told, this eliminated their ""tracheal collapse"".  I've seen it over and over, dogs coming in for coughing, diagnosed with tracheal collapse, sent home with Temaril-P, 75% of the time they came back with the dog still coughing but eating like a horse.  It was so frustrating to watch and not be able to say anything.  Not saying this is your dog's issue, just food for thought.  But, it certainly wouldn't be unusual for a 16 year old lhasa/pom mix to be in early CHF while most symptoms are still subclinical.

About that Sundowner's Syndrome... like Beautiful-Tooth-1507 said, Selegiline might help.  It's certainly worth mentioning to your vet.  It helps some dogs, others not so much.  But, in your situation I would be willing to try it.  Selegiline was/is used for treating Cushing's Disease, but seems to be more effective at treating CCD (canine cognitive dysfunction).  

By the way, don't let congestive heart failure scare you.  I'm 67 years old and taking the same meds they prescribe to dogs with CHF, furosemide and enalapril, to treat high blood pressure.  I've been on those meds for 4 years and plan to be on those for many more years.  Those two meds have extended many, many dogs lives with many increased quality of life benefits.  

It can be very hard dealing with senior dog health issues.  I have lost 5 senior dogs in the last 2 years.  I still have 8 dogs.  That's one of the ""benefits"" of working for vets for so many years.  It's hard to say ""no"" to older clients that want you to take their sweet dogs that they can no longer keep for whatever reason.  I finally realized I was an older client! and could not take any more dogs!

"Need Advice: Senior Dog’s Anxiety and Behavior Changes After Big Life Changes

I have a 15.5-year-old Chihuahua who has always been anxious and very attached to me. Last year, we moved from an apartment to a house in a new city, and I didn’t realize how much the change would impact her. Since the move, her anxiety and behavior have gotten much worse, and it feels like it’s taken years off her life.

Over the holidays, I left her with my mom while I visited my husband’s family. She did fine with my mom, but since I’ve been back, her anxiety has been through the roof. She barks at every little noise, panics if she’s not being held, and needs to see me constantly or she has a meltdown.

She’s also become really grouchy toward my husband. They used to be inseparable, but now she growls at him, avoids affection, and doesn’t even ask him for walks like she used to. Meanwhile, she’s become even clingier with me and insists on sleeping in the bed with us.

She’s been diagnosed with heart disease (CHF stage B2) and arthritis. She’s under vet and cardiologist care, but I feel like she’s declining fast. I’m grieving the happy, relaxed dog she was before the move while also trying to keep her comfortable.

I’m at a loss and need advice:
	•	How do I help her anxiety and behavior changes?
	•	Am I making things worse by giving her too much attention?
	•	How do you cope as a pet owner when your senior dog is struggling?

I’m trying my best, but this past year has been overwhelming. She’s my soul dog, and I just want her to feel safe, comfortable, and loved. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1hpgnak/need_advice_senior_dogs_anxiety_and_behavior/,,,,,,,,,,,,

#A5622964
8yr Male German Shepherd mix
82 los.
Owner Surrender on 5/01/24
Chase was made available to RESCUE ONLY with history of ""aggression disclosure"" (for growling) due to handling sensitivity (selective/sensitive to touch)
Chase greeted the runner with a relaxed body, a neutral tail wag, his ears were relaxed, his mouth was closed, and his eyes were neutral. He was easy to remove and moderately pulled on leash. In the catch pen, when the runner attempted to collar him, he began to growl at him. He was muzzled as a precaution. He entered the yard and attempted to remove his muzzle. He challenged the dog and had to be corrected a few times. Overall Chase was selective of the dogs, had medium energy and doesn't have a playstyle at this time.

Chase was moved to the side yard for handling assessment. His muzzle was never removed due to his behavior. The handler was able to pet him everywhere, but Chase remained tense and growled at her anytime she grabbed his collar. He jumped up at the handler to solicit affection, his body became neutral, his mouth was slightly open, and his eyes were neutral. The handler would pet him but then he would start to growl (never attempted to bite). Overall Chase was selective of being pet.

"Senior dog anxiety or bad behavior?
I’m not allowed to sit down.


So I think there are a few things at play here and possibly many contributing factors, but I’m really just looking for suggestions to help my boy relax….also I miss sitting on the couch in peace.

For the last 9 months or so my senior dog has started whining in the evenings between about 5pm and 9pm. If I come home from work, walk him, feed him, and jump right into making dinner and some house chores, he really just minds his business. He takes a nap, observes what I am doing, or sits by the door and monitors the neighborhood. If I, at any point in that timeframe, choose to sit down…he starts. Hr stands next to me or across the room looking at me and cries and cries. If I ignore him it just gets worse. If I get up and leave the room, it stops. At first I thought this was all anxiety but I think I have a mix of a few things playing into this behavior. 

Here are a few important things to note:
1. He’s about 12-13 yrs old. I’ve had him since he was about 1. He’s been through proper training and he’s never had this issue until the last several months.
2. About 3 yrs ago he started having seizures. Over that yrs they progressed and he now deals with clusters. He has been on Keppra for 7 months and recently added Phenobarbital about two weeks ago after a new episode of cluster seizures. We’re seeing the side effects of that lift, and with it, the evening crying sessions have started again. Meds could be contributing to it in some capacity but it really did start before he was taking any meds at all.
3. With seizures starting this late in life, it is likely that he has a brain tumor or some other underlying condition that is causing them. We can’t know without an MRI which we opted out of. Please to not come for me on this, we have our reasons so please be respectful.
4. We started to see signs of cognitive decline 2-3 yrs ago. Sundowning and confusion were the first signs. That has been a slow and steady progression. Nothing wild at this point and still more good days than bad, but the spacing out has become more common, standing on the wrong side of the door he has been using for that last 8 yrs, not sleeping through the night and sleeping more during the day, etc. 
5. We have two other dogs and they have stopped playing together like they used to. He does get anxious around them at times. They can tell that he has weakened some and there is a bit of “posturing” happening between them. We have a handle on that right now but I have seen it progress over the last year. 90% of the time they exist fine together, but they only exist and they almost never engage in play with our senior boy. The other two are about 2-3 yrs younger.
6. His bloodwork, appetite, and physical appearance show that he is otherwise in generally good health outside of normal signs of aging.

I have at times given him a bone to chew to try and calm him down. It works to distract him but after about an hour he gets himself worked up while chewing his bone and starts to cry again. It becomes a viscous cycle of chewing, crying, going outside, coming back in, pacing , chewing, going outside, and on and on. He gets his last dose of Keppra at 9pm and if I take him to our room and turn down the lights and get into bed, it seems to signal to him that the evening events are done and it’s time for sleep. He knocks right out for a few hours. If I make any noise in the room he jumps right up and I have to work to settle him back down.

I have tried mental stimulation games in the evening and they work for a short time. The bones work until they don’t. I even, just out of curiosity, started to feed him another small meal and again it works for a short time. Long walks, physical attention, and even ignoring the behavior —- I’ve tried it all.

He is mostly dependent on me though he has high trust in all other members of the family. The behavior does seem to be intensified with me, but again, he will do the same with other if I am not around. 

As of this week I am trying to reward calm behavior and revisiting training games that he did as a puppy. That helps a bit but I only started that this week and don’t know how long that will last.

I’m struggling to know if this is anxiety, bad behavior, or both. Wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this. If so, have you found anything that helps or is this the new normal as he continues to progress in his age and cognitive decline? This ONLY happens during the timeframe mentioned. It’s like clockwork. He wakes straight up from a nap at this time and launches right into the behavior. 

We want to give him what he needs to manage his anxiety but I also do not want to reward bad behavior or even reward anxious behavior and I’m just telling him that he has a reason to be worried. Any thoughts? 

Oh! And when he’s super stressed and crying we have to block him from eating dirt. He goes wild for it! Interestingly…if he gets into it before we can catch him and get a few minutes in, he tends to calm down a bit. I know this is generally harmless in small amounts but he’ll really go at it for a long time if not supervised and I do worry about parasites and things like that, so we do our best to keep him from it.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fuq5iw/senior_dog_anxiety_or_bad_behavior/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Have you asked your doctor about real anti anxiety medications? It’s totally reasonable to ask your vet if they’re willing to consider a brief trial of something like Xanax. 

Often vets don’t like to prescribe it, because humans tend to abuse it, but if you have a good, long standing relationship with your vet then they should agree to give you 3-5 days worth. 

If it works, then your dog will be on them for the rest of its life. But at this stage you’re basically at hospice level of care, so the only goal should be to keep your dog comfortable.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fuq5iw/senior_dog_anxiety_or_bad_behavior/#lq1abyl,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Our 15 year old Aussie takes Xanax for her night time anxiety and dementia. She started on a very low dose last year and we only gave it to her on nights when she could not settle. As her symptoms started to worsen we talked to our vet and she talked to us about the reasons why we should not hesitate to compassionately medicate a senior dog at night. 

She was right. 

We started to give our girl a therapeutic dose of Xanax every night and not only does she sleep better at night but she is more alert and happier during the day. She naps during the day still of course but she happily gets up and comes outside multiple times with my husband and I and our younger Aussie. Before she was just too tired. She also enjoys her walks more. 

Talk to your vet. This sounds like a senior dog who might have sundowners who is confused and anxious and on top of everything is dealing with neurological issues.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fuq5iw/senior_dog_anxiety_or_bad_behavior/#lq1tksq,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I would not call this bad behavior. If you are tempted to characterize it as that, at least recognize that the bad behavior is very likely caused by your dog suffering in some way. He is whining because he feels he needs something from you. He could have physical pain, for example while my dog is often quite stoic she gets whiny and clingy in the evenings. Getting her on pain meds has been a huge life altering improvement. Look into Sundowners syndrome also since you said this only happens in the evening hours. If your dog is in physical pain it could exacerbate the early symptoms of dementia. For me, helping my dog be in much less pain has led to far less crying, dementia symptoms, anxiety, clinginess, and has given her a little more quality time with me. 

Good luck and please consider that your dog is probably just suffering and you haven’t figured out the cause yet.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fuq5iw/senior_dog_anxiety_or_bad_behavior/#lq1ayk8,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I had to say goodbye to my best friend today 7/07 - 12/5/24
Who rescued whom?

Today I had to put down my eldest dog, Lala. She was 17. She was diagnosed with Cushing’s years ago and kidney disease one year ago. 

She was my best friend in the world. I adopted her in 2008 when she was a little over a year old from a friend who wasn’t supposed to have a dog at his apartment. He was also a workaholic and didn’t make enough time for a playful puppy. He had a habit of working on his laptop and playing with her with his feet, so she developed a habit of chasing people’s feet when they walked around the room. 

I was battling a severe case of PTSD after an auto accident. Lala and I bonded immediately. She did for me what numerous self-destructive behaviors, drugs, and thousands of dollars of therapy couldn’t do… she saved me. SHE rescued me. 

I can honestly say I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for her. She loved me unconditionally. And I gave her all the love and attention she deserved (she stopped chasing feet when she got proper attention, but even the feet chasing I miss right now).

I did everything I could to give her the best life possible. Of course I wish I could have done even more. I have three other chihuahuas, but there’s a huge void in the house tonight. 

Lala, you gave me the very best days of my life and one of the absolute worst. In my next life, I hope I come back as your doggy and you come back as my human. You’ll always be my best friend in the world, my soulmate in canine form.

"If y’all adopted a senior pup, why?
We got Summer from a humane society near us. We got her when she was 10 - she’s 11 now. We know we don’t have a ton of time with her, but we wanted to take a senior dog and give them the best golden years we possibly could. 

All we know about her is that she was dropped off at animal control by “someone” who said they found her on the street. She was chipped, though, and apparently it was her previous owners who dropped her off. I can’t imagine how confusing and awful it was for her to have her people leave her like that. 

I don’t blame them, though - they must not have been able to afford care for her, and we can. But goodness me whenever I think about her being abandoned in that way, my heart breaks. The good news is that Sum is now my lil baby and we are doing our damnedest to give her the retirement she deserves. She’s got a lot of issues, health and behavioral, but we are working on both.

We got an amazing 7 years with him that only ended yesterday when he had to leave us to head off over the Rainbow Bridge.

"Senior pitbull behavioral issues
Hello all! 
My husband and I adopted a 9 year old pit bull about a year ago. He is so sweet, affectionate, and loves being around people. 

We also have two cats which he is great with, and we have always kept cat door locks on our doors so that the cats can roam and our dog doesn’t get in all the rooms. 

A couple of weeks ago he started breaking through the locks we had on the doors and since then at night or while we are gone he will continue to crash through them. 

If we close the doors he will scratch at them until his paws are raw. 

It’s getting very frustrating and I’m not sure how to help him or where this behavior came from all of a sudden. Should be crate him while we are gone and at night? Is there another solution I’m not thinking of? 

Thank you in advance!

I don't recommend crating an anxious dog in the sense of locking him in a crate. But crate training, which teaches them to enjoy the relaxing in their crate could help him settle.

"Vet Was So Late to Euthanasia We Canceled
Our old girl has had a pretty sharp decline the last three months and after scheduling and canceling her euthanasia once before the appointment day came today. I called and confirmed the time this morning and made sure we had her meds just right to keep her resting comfortably. We had family come as well.

Forty-five minutes after the vet was supposed to be at my house I called and ask what’s happening. I was put on hold for a few minutes when the office manager comes on and explains the vet got caught up in emergencies and a fully schedule and they’ll leave in about another 30-45 min, putting them getting to our house two hours later than discussed. By now the meds we gave our dog were starting to wear off so she wouldn’t get the calm experience we wanted for her.

We have a relationship with a vet that specializes in hospice and euthanasia we’re now working with so I was able to call back and cancel, telling them how deeply damaging their behavior was.  I don’t expect a vet to prioritize a euthanasia over saving or treating a pet that will live another day, and I told the vet as much when they called me later, but my girl deserves to be treated with respect and care, especially in her last moments.

"Dry food seems to be causing the behavioral issues?
I posted a month or so ago how my 15yr old lab had been having major accidents in the house over the past year or so, coupled with a lot of pacing which my vet attributed to early signs of dementia. Then she started having major diarrhea and refused to eat her food. Well it turns out that Victor, the brand of food she's been on for the past year or so, was just recalled due to finding traces of salmonella! I started wondering if this food has always been poisoning her or something because as soon as I put her on a strict diet of rice, veggies and boiled chicken, she completely changed. No more accidents in the house. No more insatiable thirst. No more panting and pacing around the house. Even her coat started looking more healthy and she was shedding less (wife's observation, not mine). 

On the temporary rice/chicken diet, she lost a ton of weight though so I wanted to get her back on a different brand of kibble ASAP. I started with a new brand, same formula of chicken, not grain free, and slowly worked it into each meal. Fast forward two weeks and she's back to accidents 3-4 times a day, obsessively thirsty and the pacing has returned. Now, I understand that kibble is going to have a lot more nutrients and other ""unknown"" stuff in there, but is it normal to cause such behavior in older dogs? I am unsure what to do now, whether to keep on with the new food and maybe she'll adjust to it, or switch her again to something else.

"Can you correct behavior past 10 years?
Not sure if this belongs here, I adopted a senior dog in March 2018. She is a senior dog, at that time they told me she was about (10-11 years old)Vets couldn't tell for sure how old she was. She has been in and out of shelters. Gave her a bath and got her groomed since she was very matted. (Maltese/poodle mix). I knew the risk when adopting a senior dog. She has always peed and pooed on rugs. We have tried to crate-train her only to have her shake so badly (anxiety). She's been good for the past 5 years now. I tried to correct her behavior when it came to us during dinner time. She likes to stare, cry, and beg when we are eating. We tried to have her food dish around the dining table. That didn't work. She doesn't like to be outside, she holds on to her pee until we let her out. If she really needs to go she will walk back and forth. I need advice, She is now around 14-15, and the vet couldn't tell us for sure how old she is. When we do let her out, she shakes like she's having a panic attack, even if we are outside having a BBQ. She knows not to go through the trash and she still does it, She runs away when after the fact we see her/call her out on it. Wonders off a lot..when you are not looking, even on the patio but won't listen to her name, unless it's my husband calling her... Last year we adopted a 1 year old dog thinking maybe she could use a companion. She just doesn't seem to care or acknowledge her. We can't have rugs, she pees or vomits and even stretches them. We have to have my son's room close because she will pee or poo in his room. Her behavior has gotten worse over the past 2 years. We got her tested for dementia, shes healthy and not showing signs of it. She is very healthy (according to the vet) she still likes to go on walks.

,"Honestly, the bit about only responding to your husband tells me she has some measure of hearing loss and can no longer hear higher pitched sounds. That would automatically cause anxiety in any dog. At her age, loss of hearing would not be unreasonable and it would be harder for her to hear higher sounds outdoors as compared to indoors. She may not be displaying signs of cognitive decline, but hearing loss should absolutely be checked for and ruled out. Behavioral medication may be helpful to ease her day to day anxiety, as will some behavioral modification training. Ultimately her quality of life is important to you, right? If she shakes when she goes outside and wanders off a lot it sounds like she’s anxious and feels exposed and unsafe.

"What is the typical behavior senior dogs exhibit when they are ready to die? TW
I put a trigger warning because I know the thought of our senior dogs passing can be heart breaking. 

Having said that, my adorable 17 yr old dog has been exhibiting changing behaviors. She currently has kidney disease and a cancerous growth on her mouth. We can’t remove her growth due to the kidney disease, but she’s on a special kidney diet and has pain and antiflammatory meds. 

Lately she wants to be upstairs in her bed all day. She normally hangs out with us downstairs and sleeps on the couch, but I suspect she likes the upstairs because it’s warmer. She can’t play as much as she used to; she tries, but tuckers out quickly. She comes down just to go potty and to eat. Immediately afterwards she goes upstairs. 

She is eating very well, and I know she comes downstairs at night to drink water. I give her canned food so she gets extra moisture. Her bowel movements are normal; she does pee and poo in the house (thank god for our wet vacuum) but that’s because it’s cold outside. 

I’m wondering if this is normal age behavior? Her vet thinks so and she’s being monitored for her condition. What I’m wondering is has anyone observed this behavior before a pet passed away? My husband says dogs move away from their guardian when they’re ready to die but I honestly don’t think so. She sleeps in her bed next to my side of the bed every night or sleeps with my son. 

Any thoughts or advice? I’d appreciate it!",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/s08xcg/what_is_the_typical_behavior_senior_dogs_exhibit/,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I had a older dog that sounds very similar to your situation. I think she sounds fine; she sounds overall happy and healthy as she eats, sleeps, and goes to the bathroom relatively normal. I think it’s okay that she gets tired more easily, that’s just something that happens steadily. It’s good to hear that she gets up and down the stairs well too!

If I were you, I would wait until it’s warmer. If it’s nicer outside and she won’t go to the bathroom outside, maybe try to take note if she’s going inside because she chooses to, or if she doesn’t have control. And if it seems her energy and happiness seems to decline, or if she seems like she’s in pain; those might be signs that it’s time.

,"My wife and I run a senior dog sanctuary out of our home. I’m unfortunately very qualified to comment on this subject. It’s different for every dog. Dogs are very good at hiding any sort of discomfort they are in. We have had to say goodbye to many dogs and they’ve all been unique. Fortunately only one ever passed without any real warning. Even though we expected that one (we knew she had inoperable cancer) she was perfectly normal up until the last hour of her life when she showed extreme anxiety, pacing, and relieving herself repeatedly. There is really no way to predict exactly when it will happen, even if you’re expecting it. Aside from that, as long as your dog seems happy, is still eating and drinking, as well as peeing and pooping normally, then enjoy the time you have. It’s now just a measurement of quality vs. quantity. As long as quality of life is good then keep going, but if quality of life drops, then it’s time to help escort them to the rainbow bridge.

,"I just want to point out that a dog can exhibit end of life behaviours but it doesn't always mean they're dying. My late pup had esentially stopped eating for a week and we were very, very worried that it meant his life was coming to an end. He had degenerative Myolopathy and during the time he stopped eating he had a bad bout of Old Dog Syndrome. 

We were desperate to get him eating again because we loved him to bits. 

We tried:

. His regular Kibble 

. Wet food

. Half wet food half kibble

. Half wet food, half kibble plus water to make a soup

. Heating up his food to trigger his nose

. Pouring some meat fat on top of the food

. Adding cheese on top 


Etc. 


Eventually I was practically begging him with tears in my eyes to eat and I sat on the floor with him as he laid down. I took a palm full of kibble and brought it to his mouth and he started eating! After a few handfuls from his bowl I held up the bowl to his mouth and he continued eating! 

I figured out if you held it up to his face at an angle he'll eat. We concluded that he wasn't eating because the Old Dog Syndrome was making him dizzy and he couldn't find his bowl! He lived almost to a year afterwards until he developed phenomena and he had to be put down because he was suffering. But he lived to 14 and we stuck by him even though he became incontinent and his hind legs stopped working and he was well loved.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/s08xcg/what_is_the_typical_behavior_senior_dogs_exhibit/#hs460c9,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Feeling conflicted about scheduled euthanasia
My yorkie Wanee, 3 months away from 16, has been very healthy up until this past weekend. Her conditions really worsened over the three days she was at the hospital receiving meds and fluids and with a feeding tube. She has really high bilirubin (~50) causing icteric eyes/tongue/skin. She refused to eat, drink, or move at the hospital so when i brought her back home yesterday, the expectation from the vets was for me to make quality of life decision asap. 

My family is flying over tomorrow/sunday so I’ve went ahead and made an arrangement for euthanasia on Monday while everyone’s here.

The thing is, since she’s been back, she seems mostly fine. She’s walking around checking things out, going up and down small ledges, drinking water on her own(!), and sleeping fine with no signs of seizures yet.

She is still refusing to eat, so I use a syringe and brothed down wet food to help her eat for now. She’d also pretty dang yellow in the eyes and the tongue.

Other than that though, her behavior is more or less the same as before she got sick and also doesn’t seem to be in pain (no shivering/panting/pacing around). 

I feel really conflicted about making QOL decision so early and now thinking I should cancel the appointment, and give her a bit more time until I see signs of more discomfort (seizure, etc). Is this too selfish? 

I asked on r/askVets and they were pushing for immediate euthanasia yesterday. But seeing that she’s doing fairly well today, I know living today at least was a better decision for her.

I gave mine a bigger does a meds to give her a good last day and she seemed better, she became more alert at the vet, after they sedated her she looked scared and she wanted out of that room. she didn't lay down and go to to sleep, she just sort of dropped and was out. they told me I could have as much time as I needed and I was thinking I would take her home, but they came in before i was ready and I didn't stop them.

"How often does your senior eat?
Hi! 
Long time follower but have not made an actual post here.

My boy Juno who is a beagle mix has had kidney issues since he was 7 years old. Followed on by both cruciates needing surgery when he was 10 and 11. Followed on by liver issues.

He is now over 14 and has had a lot of life in him until we just hit a really bad cold wave. He’s still wanting to walk — in the summer he was still doing 2-3 miles a day and now for the winter he usually on about to 1-2 just because of the cold. With how cold it’s been real feel in the single digits I’ve been doing less because of his arthritis. He’s kept in good health through acupuncture/chiropractic care as well as through some western medicine. 

Since the cold has started he’s become more finicky with his food. He began the picky behavior back in 2022, that’s when we switched to all home cooked food or my vet carries some small batch food that I’ll give him. He’s not losing weight but depending on the time he will just look at his food and then walk away. The only other out of character thing he is doing is laying in my office more often, which I find strange because it’s colder in there. My office is right off the main room, he has beds all over the place. 

I’m just curious how often do your seniors eat? And does the cold tend to make their eating worse? 

I am leaning towards this being pain related he is NOT on any pain medicines he gets a CBD with tumeric as well as a joint supplement although the last couple of days he hasn’t gotten the joint supplement just due to his pickiness. 

He was just at his integrative vet last Friday planning to take him back Monday to get another acupuncture session and maybe some laser therapy. 

I just have had such an immense wave of anticipatory grief which I’ve been feeling since his original onset of the kidney issues when he was 7. I am trying to set next expectations like it’s ok if he just eats once a day as long as he isn’t dropping weight right now but I would love to hear from others.

"Senior dog becoming snappy, aggressive and grumpy?
Over the past several months, I’ve noticed that my just-about 12 year old corgi has become more noticeably snappy and aggressive, especially towards bedtime or in bed. 

I’ve had him since he was 10 weeks old and he’s been though so much with me during the most significant events of my life (getting out the military, moving, marriage and divorce) and it feels like such a long time ago and almost a different dog who used to snuggle, let me hold him, and be right next to me all night. 

Now during bedtime or when he’s about to sleep, and when I go to pet him he snaps frequently, growls and will occasionally get aggressive before I have to loudly tell him no or to stop. He even sleeps at the foot of the bed and seems very distant. 

Friends and family joke that he is just old and grumpy, but I maybe just in denial. In my research of dementia any other potential issues, I’m just not sure. That mixed with much more barking throughout the night. He doesn’t seem to be lost or confused, and more acts grumpy and annoyed. I just can’t put my finger down on it, as nothing in our lifestyle has significantly changed and all I want to do is give him the best life he has remaining. 

Any stories, tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. ",,https://i.redd.it/eyxlpbol3bid1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1eqqui9/senior_dog_becoming_snappy_aggressive_and_grumpy/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Dogs can literally have a broken/amputated leg and be hopping around on a stump yet NOT make a peep of pain. This is their animal instinct saving them from becoming someone stronger's prey. We have to learn to look at them through eyes of love. Take them to the vet first. For arthritis I used this Hemp oil for years which is human grade with a dosage calculated for a 10lb dog.

All the dog CBD oil products I tried were so damn expensive it's disgusting plus had no one really checking them. They all made BOTH my senior Chihuahuas sick as hell too. I used this one on myself first for my own 42/10 CRPS pain levels. The only problem I found for me is I was a smidge more hungry. After the dogs gained a teeny tiny amount of weight I switched to these Hemp calming chews at Petco. I'm fixing to switch the eldest back since she's losing her appetite lately & the science-rite REALLY helped with keeping her at 10lbs.

These are the regular chews:

"My senior girl who is struggling in her last few times 
My sweet baby struggled with pancreatitis and then a bacteria resistant infection right after. Most recently she’s also had severe constipation as she is past the pancreatitis and infection but the inappetite during her antibiotics resulted in a diet lacking fiber and most likely her gut bacteria being killed off by the antibiotics.

She is now off the antibiotics and took her first poop in days and looked to be much like her old self. I am hoping with a better diet and being off the antibiotics will give her some well needed recycle / reflush of her internal fluids.

"My boy was diagnosed with degenerative arthritis vs degenerative myopathy in the ER today 
My boy Nokie Bear collapsed after our 1 mile walk at the lake this morning. 

He refused to go up the dog ramp into the car. His hind end collapsed, then his body jerked almost like a seizure and he fell over and urinated on himself. I moved the ramp over to give him room & help him get comfortable. I flagged a guy down to help me lift him into the car, then took him to the ER. 

He has a history of heat related collapse in 2019 when hiking. He’s currently being treated for hip dysplasia & arthritis with an extensive regimen. 

They’re going to do a workup to try to find out why he collapsed. Labs, xrays, iv sedation & narcotics for pain control. She’s concerned about heat related collapse & progressive degenerative myelopathy.  

Vet recommended increasing dog rehab & adding acupuncture 

We had the talk about CPR/resuscitation if he should code during the tests from the iv meds… i’m not ready to let him go unless he’s unsalvageable.  😢 

The thing is, his behavior has changed recently, he’s much more loving towards me. Historically he’s always been aloof, but now he come directly to me for affection & snuggles. It’s like he’s letting me know he loves me & is thanking me for adopting him. It’s said that a dog’s behavior changes when they know their time to pass is near. I just want to be able to have the time to give him a good goodbye.

Since we got home, he’s very restless, refuses to eat (which could be the meds), having trouble drinking. I did elevate his water bowl, and he’s staying in the kitchen area. He does keep watching me. He looks at me adoringly when i called him by his nickname “little bear.” He’s my heart dog, my gentle giant, that i adopted at age 3, he’s now 10. And earlier he kept going outside to the back gate or to sit alongside the house in the sun; those are places he goes when he’s scared of loud noises. 

I just don’t want him to suffer, and if it’s time for him to cross the rainbow bridge then I’m willing to let him go.

All you can do is your best to keep your boy comfortable. It sounds like the long hikes are too much for him now. Try shorter walks a few times a day. Also be careful with heat- shepps overheat soooo easily! ESP when they get older, my boy hated the heat more and more each year.

"16 yo dog with CCD
Hello! After months of hesitation I gathered my courage and finally took my beloved 16 yo dog to an MRI scan. I was pretty sure she is suffering of IVDD, because she’s been paralysed for months (in the sense that she can’t coordinate her legs to stand up). However, the MRI diagnozed her with cognitive disfuction, for which obviously there is no treatment.

Now, this diagnosis in itself doesn't come as a shocker given her age. However, the real shocker was the vet saying that this CCD is the main cause of her paralysis, and that there is no need for further investigation about a potential IVDD. After a few hours of grieving (all these months I’d had a glimmer of hope deep inside that her paralysis is treatable), I’ve now decided to do some research on my own about CCD, and, to my surprise, CCD is nowhere given as a potential cause for paralysis.

I would like to have some more opinions here on this topic, because I want to fight for my dog till the end. Her quality of life is otherwise good: her blood work looks good, she eats eats normally, she drinks normally, she urinates/defecates normally, no vision loss, no hearing loss. She does sometimes get restless (and I can totally trace this to her dementia), but overall the only big issue is her paralysis. Should I accept that dementia lead to her paralysis and there is no coming back? Or should I request an opinion from another vet? And maybe investigate about a potential IVDD?

"Proactively Preventing CCD
Hello,

My 15ish year old pup passed away in July from presumably cancer (we chose not to do further diagnostics because he was on everything he could be) but struggled with canine cognitive decline for about 2 years prior. Thankfully, Selegiline made a huge impact and kept him relatively stable for much of those 2 years. A lot of vets didn’t recommend it for some reason but it was night and day improvement. When he couldn’t take it anymore, he spiraled quickly. I don’t think he knew who me and my husband were the last week or two. It was really hard. I had him for almost 13 years.

Anyway, we adopted a new pup about a week later to help prevent me spiraling honestly. She’s been great. Tiny 4.5 lb chihuahua. She’s only about 11 months old. I’m just wondering if there are foods or supplements that might be helpful now to help keep her brain as healthy as possible as long as possible. I’d like to avoid going through CCD with a dog again if possible. It was heartbreaking.

Any tips? She is currently on Zignature Small Bites Lamb Formula dry food and I use a bit of canned food (also Zignature) of different flavors to help her eat the dry food. No supplements. Just monthly flea/heartworm/tick prevention otherwise.

Thanks for your time!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1fz3sat/proactively_preventing_ccd/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"CCD and aggression... any connection to Simparica?
My family and I had to put down our 7 1/2 year old mixed breed rescue dog because of increasingly common aggression incidents a few years ago, and the vet was never able to figure out what was causing it. It started with resource guarding food but only with a few members of the family and didn't get much worse than just small growls. Then he had a few isolated incidents of getting aggressive with visitors that he knew well and he had greeted happily at the door, which we thought for a while had something to do with eyesight, because he seemed to just not recognize them all of a sudden. It got worse over time despite our best attempts at training, and he eventually bit me, even though I had been the one person he had never shown even slight aggression towards, and my mom in two separate incidents.

For a time we questioned if it had anything to do with the medicine Simparica, because it got worse when he started taking it and got better for a while after we stopped giving it to him. But the vet, throughout blood tests and an MRI, found no evidence of any other issues. I just came across an article on Canine cognitive dysfunction, which I had never heard of, and got this sinking feeling in my stomach because the aggression issues, heightened anxiety, sudden inability to recognize familiar people, vision impairment, lethargy, etc all sounds eerily like the changes we saw in him.

I'm not quite sure what I'm asking exactly, I just want desperately to finally have some sort of answer on what happened to my best friend. Does it seem possible/likely that this is what he was experiencing? Are there any cases anyone has seen of relation between CCD and Simparica?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1fc6909/ccd_and_aggression_any_connection_to_simparica/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"What is the youngest you have diagnosed a dog with CCD?
Hello vets,

I'm currently working on an article for my blog on Canine Cognitive Disorder. I recently found out about a chihuahua who was diagnosed with CCD at just 4 years old. I know this is extremely rare, but I was wondering what is the youngest you've seen a dog develop CCD?

Thank you for taking the time to reply.

Not sure this qualifies since this is a general question and not for a specific dog:

Age: The youngest you've seen CCD in a dog  
Sex/Neuter status: Either

"Dog with CCD suddenly much worse
My dog has been battling CCD for awhile - the sundowners, pacing, getting stuck under stuff, lower appetite. She’s seen improvement on Senilife and was recently started on Librela injections for her pain, which has improved her arthritis and was helping some of her sleep symptoms. Usually if she doesn’t get enough sleep at night, she catches up during the day. 

However, we had a vet visit to discuss some plans and got her second Librela injection on Wednesday. For two nights, she slept better than she has in months. Then on Saturday, she started pacing. And did not stop. She won’t sleep, day or night, until she is fully exhausted. She ended up having a cluster of 6+ focal seizures over the course of 2 days (she has had them before but not since beginning Gabapentin), but did not stop pacing. We took her to the ER vet and they treated her for epilepsy and started her on Keppra.

Now we’re home, she’s back to pacing after sleeping off her ER meds! We thought maybe the pacing could have been a pre/post-ictal symptom, but she has been seizure free since our ER visit and still unable to stop. She also seems a lot more disoriented and uncomfortable with me, as well as sort of unsure about who we are (the way she was before we began Senilife), when just three days ago she was happy to cuddle up and nap. 

Of course we are trying to get in to see our regular vet, but I am curious if anyone has witnessed this rapid of a backslide before? Given that Librela has been the only change, I am curious, but she didn’t have any reactions to her first injection so I am open to the idea it might be a coincidence.

 Species:

• Age: ~12

• Sex/Neuter status: Female spayed

• Breed: Pug

• Body weight: 15 pounds

• History: CCD, Arthritis, focal seizures. On Gabapentin, Senilife supplements, Librela, and just started Keppra. 

• Clinical signs: Pacing, increased confusion. 

• Duration: 3 days

,"It sounds like you’re doing a great job trying to help your pup as much as you can. CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) can be a frustratingly difficult constellation of symptoms to manage and there’s no one treatment answer. Unfortunately, brain disease (tumor, inflammation, fluid accumulation, etc.) can look similar to CCD and without an MRI, it’s impossible to differentiate. In an ideal world, we’d know for sure what we’re treating, but it’s often not the case in veterinary medicine. CCD can suddenly get worse, but when more neurological symptoms develop as I’m treating something that shouldn’t change quickly, I worry about the possibility I’m not treating the right thing. Unfortunately, I’d be worried about a progressing brain tumor or multiple strokes causing what you’re seeing and she may have had it all along and CCD was a reasonable, but incorrect, assumption or another problem is developing in addition to the CCD.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1avhyn9/dog_with_ccd_suddenly_much_worse/#kre3vch,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My dog has CCD and I cannot find a Vet who will treat it in my small town.
My dog paces all night long, crawls up into corners where you shouldn't be and forgets how to get out, he's literally forgotten how to eat and drink and from hours of research I think he has canine cognitive disorder. I can't even find a veterinarian who has any knowledge of it whatsoever in my small town of Apache Junction. Does someone know what type of doctor I would see and recommend a doctor who will treat it or at least consider it.

Current doctor doesn't have a clue just says it's a tumor his blood work comes up fine. His behavior is similar to other dogs where people have taken videos online. Every night is extremely difficult during the days a little bit better but I believe this occurred over many years.

Clinical Signs: Pacing, Accidents, Circling

Duration: Few Months

Location: NY

My 16 year old dog began having seizures in April. With the help of Gabapentin, she has stopped having seizures but does seem to be undergoing some cognitive decline that is consistent with dog dementia (circling, pacing, accidents in the house). Right now, in the morning she gets some calming bites with melatonin and CBD oil and at night some of the gabapentin. Turkey tail mushroom for the potential brain tumor (we did everything but an MRI to rule out because the vet said we shouldn't put her under).

Her quality of life is still good so please do not comment along the lines of ""put her down"". It is not time yet (please trust that I know and am being very careful not to prolong any suffering).

**BUT I do want to know if anyone had any luck with anything helping the dog's condition?** I know dementia is degenerative so I'm trying to slow the process in the least painful way possible. She has not perfect kidneys so preferably nothing that would be hard on them.

"CCD selegiline
Hello,

My dog's been prescribed selegiline 2.5mg for his dementia. He's been taking it for a few days and it seems that it's making his symptoms worse: more restless, walking in circles and new one's like moaning. This was given to us by a neurologist, the side effects weren't discussed, so I assumed the medicine either helps him or nothing changes.

I took my dog to the vet clinic yesterday and the internist said to discontinue the selegiline and prescribed 50mg of Gabapentin twice a day (my dog is 16 and weighs 3kg) to calm him down.

I know that the neurologist is at the clinic on Tuesday so I will call him. In the meantime should Selegiline be stopped abruptly instead of maybe lowering the dose? I'd like to help my dog's dementia if it's possible. Are his side effects normal and would go away or are they serious? I've read about the serotonin syndrome, maybe that's what he was experiencing.

"CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction)
CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction)

Good afternoon everyone,
I’m going to try and make this short and sweet.
My 16 yo mini-Doxy (dachshund) has CCD (essentially doggy dementia).This has caused him to have Day-Night reversal where he is up all night wandering the house whining and crying. He is physically very healthy and has a healthy appetite/thirst. During the early afternoons he is his normal goofy happy go lucky self but at night he changes and becomes frantic and inconsolable.  His vet has tried three different med combos (currently on Gabepentin and Phenobarbital 2x a day) and nothing seems to help. It’s been about four months and I haven’t slept more than 3 hours a night in about two months. My fiancé and I love him more than anything but I am not so sure how much more I can take. I’ve tried a thunder shirt, cuddling, cbd. He normally sleeps with us and has for years but now doesn’t seem to want too. I used to be able to pick him up and he would calm down but now that won’t even help. I’ve tried to talk to the vet about helping him cross the rainbow bridge but he seems insistent on trying different drugs. I’m ok with more options but I also don’t want him to live in a drug fueled haze. The past week or so I’ve payed with him on the living room floor just petting him while he whines. I don’t know what else to do and I’m so tired. Has anyone dealt with this? Does anyone have advice?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/obpkh3/ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"B/D vs Bright Minds vs Neurocare for CCD
Dog, 12 years old, M/Neutered, Maltese, 9lb, CCD, Arthritis, 3-4 months

Hi. I started feeding my dog Purina Pro Plan Bright Mind once I noticed a few symptoms of Canine Cognitive Dysfunction such as increased anxiety at night and staring at open space. I chose that kibble because he was on another Purina Pro Plan food before. My vet approved of my decision when I brought him in to get checked for the CCD. The symptoms have been alleviated so far with the help of the CBD Oil, carprofen, and gabapentin.

The food is running out, so I went to [chewy.com](https://chewy.com) to order an extra bag. Then I found out that Hill's PD's B/D Brain Again Care and Purina Pro Plan Neurocare could be alternatives to Bright Minds. They seem to be more expensive but I don't mind the additional cost if they are better alternatives, however marginal it may be.

Is it worth changing the food to either of these at this point? Or is there no evidence to prove that they are better than Bright Minds?

"Anxiety vs CCD?
How do you know if you’re dealing with cognitive dysfunction in dogs or it’s just anxiety? My golden just turned 10, and from the time I got him at 1 year until he was 8, he was fairly confident and not bothered by things. The last 2 years he’s developed anxiety and it’s getting worse. He seems ok in every other way, physically he’s still active, we’ve had blood work done and it’s fine, he still enjoys rides and hikes and cuddles, but he just gets freaked out by storms and fireworks and gunshots now, like shaking and pacing and panting, and nothing helps. I’ve tried trazadone, Valium, Prozac, cbd, and Sileo. He is getting to where he is is uncomfortable randomly when it’s not storming, like he thinks h hears something outside or upstairs and he startles from sleep, stares like he’s worried it’s going to be thunder, and after a minute lays back down. He also hates when I’m cooking for some reason, he gets super stressed about that. I don’t know what else to try other than I was going to ask my vet about Anipryl maybe, but I’m not sure it’s dementia more than just anxiety? I read anxiety can be the start of dementia so idk. I think his eyes are going slightly, if it’s dark he acts like he doesn’t know where I am until I speak sometimes. Is there anything else I can try? I hate to think he’s so anxious all the time, I don’t want the rest of his life to be miserable. I’m a human nurse in the NICU/picu so I’m a huge advocate for quality of life vs quantity.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/ohvz0d/anxiety_vs_ccd/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hello, I'm writing in hopes that somebody can offer us a bit of advice during a rough time.

Our dog just had his senior physical and most everything came back good and normal. (vet explained in the past that the elevated blood counts could be due to dehydration - he stresses really bad in the car on the way to the vet.)

He has a history of elevated ALT, but we're trying to manage it. However, he has unexpectedly started showing some signs of canine cognitive dysfunction at night. Most concerning, he is focusing on a closet or wall at bedtime and barking furiously at it for up to 2 hours straight. He will even lay down out of exhaustion, panting and continues to bark until he can't any more.

Over the past year, he's become more irritable at home and especially at night, but we chalked it up to him being older and tired. We try to I.D. his triggers the best we can.

But this barking at the wall/closet is new and we can't do anything to bring him out of it.

This has been going on for 2 weeks, but recently got even worse. We got him on Senilife right away, which seemed to give him 4 nights with less than 10 minutes of barking... but now we're back at square one.  We are so afraid he is going to give himself a heart attack.

During the day, he is completely normal. He's eating his dog food well for the first time in his life, and he's very physically active with walking. Affectionate.  However, he does sleep through the day after that walk. (pretty understandable, as its alot for a guy his size). However, he sleeps harder now than ever.

We've been giving him an extra walk at night too, since he seems to enjoy that. We wish it would help with his night time restlessness, though.

Here's where we're stuck :it sounds like covid has struck our veterinarian and he won't be back until mid-september.

We had the hospital director look at his file, and he said it does sound like ""a little bit of senility"" starting. He would not prescribe a PRN sedative due to the elevated ALT.  However, our dog is suffering every night, in the meantime.  It's heartbreaking.  Thankfully everybody in our house is understanding and just wants to get him some help. We will never yell at him or punish him for something like this. I ordered him the Zylkene supplement, but it won't be here til Saturday.

My question is : for a dog experiencing this behavior, would you start him on Anipryl right away? It doesn't sound like it could hurt, so long as it doesn't affect his appetite.

We're waiting on another call back (it takes so long) from the vet. They're completely overwhelmed over there right now.

They don't sound like they're too familiar with this medication, but it sounds to me like it might be one of our only hopes here for getting our dog some relief.

Also, we are prepared to take him in to see another vet next week if we have to.  However, due to aggression with other vets, we have always taken him to the same one as that vet has a background in behavior/training and gets along with our dog.

Any advice or information for helping us navigate this would be so appreciated. He is my best friend and it's busting my heart into pieces to see him so stressed . Thank you so much.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/i98ltg/our_vet_is_out_with_an_illness_and_our_dog_has/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Just wanted to update this for the search archives, in case anyone in the future struggles with the issues we had with our dog. 

&#x200B;

So, our regular vet came back and right away, he told us he doesn't think he has dementia. He knows his personality well and he never displayed symptoms in the daytime. 

The cause of these symptoms was : he is terrified / hates being upstairs.  He hates when we even go upstairs for a moment.   We are not sure why, but it might be due to fireworks in the past. 

I moved my bedroom downstairs to sleep with him down there at night ,and it's completely healed him!  He no longer barks, no longer gets stuck behind furniture..  He's playful as a puppy again, because he's actually getting sleep at night now. 

Amazing difference!!  We also cut back alot of the meat in his diet, and it brought his liver values within normal range. 

&#x200B;

So if anybody is reading this down the road, try these tips before looking at dementia meds.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/i98ltg/our_vet_is_out_with_an_illness_and_our_dog_has/#gez2x1q,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Anxious senior dog during the day 
Hello! My 12 yr dog appears to be anxious or in pain mostly during the day. She shakes, starts to pant and has a hard time resting for long amounts of time anymore.

My vet has been trying to rule a lot of stuff out, prescribed her all kinds of different meds (methocarbamol, gabapentin, codiene) and right now I feel at a loss. I feel like she may have early CCD/dementia but again I’m not sure.

Currently I’m trying to wean her off gabapentin (she only gets 100mg at night as of this post) as I was fearful this was side effects from the medication. She takes melatonin/hemp chews at night and stays pretty rested from 8/9PM  until about 4/5AM. 

Any insight?

"Is it safe to give my dog an MRI? He has Cushings & Stage 1/2 Kidney Disease.
My dog (12.5YO neutered male Shih Tzu) has been struggling with a low/picky appetite for about a year despite having Cushings Disease. He has Kidney Disease now as well, but his doctors don't think his levels are high enough to account for any GI upset.

In any case, the ravenous appetite that comes with Cushings Disease tends to override any inappetence from Kidney Disease. As a result, his internist suggests doing an MRI to determine if his pituitary tumor progressed into a macroadenoma that's suppressing his hunger.

I doubt he'd be a good candidate for radiation should they even find a macroadenoma, but I think it would be worthwhile to know. The specialists could also check for any signs of CCD.

If we move forward, the procedure will be done at a major veterinary hospital. It will be overseen by a board-certified anesthesiologist who also serves as the department head. They'll definitely do a modified protocol for his kidneys, but I don't have any specifics yet as to what that will entail.

It's my understanding that the MRI will be about an hour, and they can always ""wrap it up"" sooner if they find what they're looking for. His internist seems more open to him going through a procedure like an MRI, compared to something like a dental cleaning or more invasive surgery.

Would you opt for the procedure if it were your dog? Is there anything I should check or ask? Anything else I should look into?

"Is my vet waiting for *me* to bring up the e-word?
Canine  
Female-Spayed  
Lab/Husky  
61lbs  
14 years, 9 months  
Canine Cognitive Dysfunction

Tl;Dr - I'm feeling like it's time to let my girl go, but my vet has not yet brought that up as a consideration.

Last year my girl started showing signs of CCD. I didn’t even know it was a thing and had just attributed it to normal aging. The eventual road to diagnosis started with an off-hand conversation with one of my dog’s vets and my mention of how she was going to the wrong side of doors. We started supplements back then and of course have closely monitored things.

My dog has two vets. One is her “general practitioner” so to speak – bloodwork, vaccines, illnesses (UTI) and such. The other is a specialist of the neuro type (still a DVM, just doesn’t do GP as a rule anymore), as she had a spinal injury 8 years ago which she almost 100% recovered from. We see her every 8 weeks and I’m always grateful for her friendship and having a second set of hands/eyes on my dog so often.

As this year has gone on, my dog has progressed further into the CCD. Bad days, good days. We’ve also of course gone the full-blown medication route. In the last couple of months it’s gotten pretty bad. She’s just not all there most of the time, mentally – like the lights are on but nobody’s home. She’s aware of her surroundings – watches me for food or cues that we’re going for a walk, a car ride and so on. If I leave the room though, she shakes and whimpers after a couple of minutes. She’s afraid of the large fenced back yard we once spent most of our time in. She gets confused, agitated, and anxious and the drugs are not cutting it. She wakes in the night a lot, panting, and there’s nothing I can do to console her – not even just leaving all the lights/tv on 24/7. It’s like most of the time she’s just going through the motions. She rarely wants to be loved on – but I don’t know if that’s because of all the meds I’m always having to give, or something else.

The best way I can think of to describe her is a scared anxious zombie, on the bad days.

Does she have her good, lucid moments? Yes, and I jump for joy when that happens. But those are getting more and more rare. It’s horrific to watch. This morning on our walk, I bawled the entire time. She was just pulling and panting (it’s not hot). She knows the way, but she’s not having fun or stopping to enjoy the sniffs. She just wants to get back to her couch and be anxious there. Within a few minutes she’ll be antsy to go for a walk, as if we hadn’t yet. We go for a car ride every evening. Sometimes she’s there – snoot out the window taking in the sniffs, but other times she’s not – just sitting there panting like, “Yep, we’re in the care. No idea why. Let’s just go home now.” When I leave, she flips out until she wears herself out, drugs not phasing her a bit. (This was never the case before. Was always content while I was at work. I work blocks from home, never gone more than 4 hours at a time. Have cameras all over the house to keep tabs.)

I do not like putting her through this. This is not a happy life for her. I have all the patience in the world and will stay by her side without hesitation. I signed up for this. She is my world. We have been so many places together and shared so many experiences that I can't imagine life without her, but I know i need to. I had been prepared for her to be my slow little old lady. But this? Mental anguish she’s having? This was never on my radar. I don’t know if it’s because I’m unprepared or if I’m justified in being so…in distress myself watching her. I don’t feel like it’s the right thing to do to drag this on unless there is some miracle one of the vets has still up their sleeves. It's not fair to her, in my opinion. But my opinion isn't a professional one, it's the opinion of an emotional pet owner facing the loss of her best friend and first ever dog.

And herein lies the dilemma. I don’t think we should continue this way, but I don’t know what the vet thinks. Your job has to be SO difficult in this situation. You want pet owners to know that you’re not giving up on their baby, but the mention of euthanasia has to be a tough one as well. You’re sort of damned if you do, damned if you don’t, depending on the person I guess.

A friend of mine point blank asked if my dog feels joy from anything anymore. Oh, I was so offended at first! And then when it sunk in later…well, I had to admit the answer was mostly “no”, unless you count food.

The specialist vet told me to keep a log of my dog’s good and bad days. Even as simple as a calendar on the fridge – green for good, red for bad. That we need to track her quality of life and base any decision on that. She explained and reminded me that my dog doesn’t understand why she feels like she does, which makes it that much more terrifying for them.

The GP vet and I have had a standing telephone appointment on Fridays – ranging from weekly to biweekly, depending on what’s going on (changes of meds etc). This way she can get us in at her convenience when she has a chance and us not clog up appointment time (I can take phone calls whenever). Last month, on one of my dog’s bad days, I asked the vet at what point does this become cruel to keep going on? Her response was that, well, she was still physically ok and not in any pain and recommended we change a drug dose/timing.

The last time we talked, my dog had been having a string of good days. I mentioned that I understand this is unpredictable, but I also don’t know what to expect. How does it go from here? I know that’s a question that has no tangible answer – no two patients are alike. She explained in a great way that we’re in an in-between stage right now, and sympathized about how hard it is.

We left it that we would talk again in two weeks. That two weeks is this Friday. I don’t know what to say or how to word it. My dog can’t continue like this. It’s not fair, and it’s terrible to watch. Do I \*want\* to lose her (it’s just she and I, and has been for the last 11 years)? No, but in my gut I know that unless something drastically changes – and quickly – that I do not want to continue this way. But the words of the GP vet keep ringing in my mind how she said that my dog isn’t physically in pain. Does that mean she doesn’t think it’s time until something fails physically? Or did I misunderstand? I don’t know, and I don’t know how to ask this tactfully. Like I said, she was very understanding on the last call and acknowledged that this is very difficult time.

So help me. Please. I don’t know what to say to my vet.

With those “not physical” words rolling around in my head, I feel like she’s going to imply that I’m a monster if I mention that maybe we should let my dog go unless there is something else we can do that will work in short order to ease her (mental) pain. Am I wrong? Is this how it goes with CCD? You just wait until they physically deteriorate? It would also feel weird to walk into the vet office with an animal who is moving under their own power just fine and leaving with them being deceased shortly after. I don’t know. I’m lost. I feel so helpless in helping my girl because I don’t know what to do.

,"Oh my, what a difficult position you must find yourself in. I hope you're coping well right now. 

The main thing I would say is that you spend the most time with your dog and if you think your dog's condition has progressed to a point where she has significantly fewer ""happy"" days, it's definitely something you should let your vet know. 

""With those “not physical” words rolling around in my head, I feel like she’s going to imply that I’m a monster if I mention that maybe we should let my dog go unless there is something else we can do that will work in short order to ease her (mental) pain."" >> I honestly don't think she'll imply this at all. 

Another thing I'd add is that these conversations are also very difficult for us & the reason some vets are, at times apprehensive to bring it up is precisely because of the predicament you're having - they don't want to be implicated as the ""monster"" who suggested euthanasia. 

But I honestly feel as though you might feel much better (regardless of the outcome of the discussion) if you did speak to your vet. So my advice is to just embrace yourself for a conversation and not necessarily a decision. Doing so might hopefully make you feel better until Friday, perhaps?

"8.5 yo Husky with Neuro issues beginning to lose bladder and bowel control
NOTE: I am going to contact my personal vet on Monday, but would like to hear from other professionals in the field in the meantime. 

Hello Vets/Techs

My main question is, how do I know when it's time to make end of life decisions for my husky?

I have an 8.5 yo neutered male husky (neutered at 2yo) who has had seizures for 4 years which were well controlled on 60mg Phenobarbital two times a day up until last year. Last year he began having focal seizures (mainly head tremors that came with a postictal confusion) and was put on Keppra (I'll have to look up the dosage but that's also 2x a day). Shortly before being prescribed the Keppra, I began to notice that he was falling a lot and when I took video of his gait, we confirmed that his rear legs were crossing especially at turns. Our vet prescribed him a glucosamine and msm supplement in addition to half a carprofen 2x a day for arthritis of the knee, but did confirm that it was likely a progressive neurological issue causing his falling and gait problems. 

Over the past 4 months or so, he's been having various issues on and off. He has anisocoria that comes and goes where one pupil is unresponsive to light and stays blown, will stay like that for 2-3 days, and then go back to normal. The same eye also swelled/drooped in the upper eyelid at one point, which was diagnosed as allergies after a 10 day Claritin trial, but I wanted to mention it here just in case. Now, he is having incontinence issues. Every other day he's having accidents in his crate, or extreme urgency where he almost can't make it outside when he needs to go. It's formed but soft poo and pee each time. We restrict food and water after 7 and do a 10 letout, and we're up by 8 the next morning (all dogs are crated for safety during the night and when we aren't home, and a few need to be crated and rotated due to repeated conflicts.) He also is only eating about every 3rd day, which he's done in the hot months since he was a puppy, but it's getting colder and his appetite isn't getting better.

Now, I know that with progressive neuro diseases  incontinence can signal a decline. However when I do simple neuro tests like paw placement at home, it isn't a severe deficit (there IS a 5 sec delay in righting the paw, but he does do it on his own). I do monthly QOL tests using the Journeys scale and while he's been falling on the scale (6 months ago he was at 38/80, now he's at 27/80), his score isn't so low that I feel the need to rush him in for an emergency end-of-life. He can still be playful, still runs even though he falls and is uncoordinated, and sometimes has a harder time getting up. So I'm having a really hard time deciding what my criteria needs to be for making the decision to euthanize. I don't want to leave him suffering for long (preferably at all), because I saw my mom hold on to her dog past what I'd be comfortable with (he had degenerative myelopathy), and I wouldn't forgive myself if that happened to him. But I also don't want my vet to think that I'm trying to get a convenience euthanasia, especially because he'll be the third dog of our original 7 who we have to say goodbye to. Two of the others were Great Danes, one that we had to let go 2 years ago at 4 yo due to a suspected brain tumor, the other we had to let go last year at 6 yo because she had a ruptured hemangiosarcoma. The third was a 12 yo spaniel mix who was suffering from CCD and arthritis, bith contributing to increasing anxiety and refusal of even the most high value treats despite trying medication for both. Logically, I know that all three of our previous dogs' euthanasias were justified, and with our current pack having two 8yos and two 7yos in addition to a 1yo and a 6 mo, we're llikely going to have to make this decision a lot over the coming 5-10 years. I don't want to look like I don't care about my animals, but I also refuse to let them suffer for my own comfort.

"How do I stop Anipryl?
Hi everyone! My 14.5 year old diabetic Pembroke Welsh Corgi (M, neutered) has been taking Anipryl 10mg for about 3 weeks to help with CCD symptoms. We have noticed that his blood sugar has been dropping rapidly with the medication, and his sundowners seems to have gotten worse, so we’d like to stop the medication. I have asked our primary vet if we could stop cold turkey, or if we need to taper. She didn’t have an answer, but suggested tapering it. A Facebook group I’m in for dogs with CCD said it’s dangerous to quit cold turkey, but ultimately told me to check with my vet or with Zoetis. Zoetis said there’s nothing that says it has to be tapered, but to check with our vet.

"Mystery Condition, 13.5 year old Male Norwegian Elkhound Mix
Hello,

**We are looking for anyone’s help to generate potential ideas/diagnoses/illnesses we should consider for our dog. We would like to talk about/consider these ideas with our current vet(s). We are not seeking a specific diagnosis or treatment plan.**

Our Dog had potentially been diagnosed with Canine Cognitive Dysfunction, by our first vet. We are not 100% confident that is that case, but we could be wrong. We are working with a 2nd vet to confirm the diagnosis/get a second opinion. Our current vet thinks this is a complicated case and has us meeting with a 2^(nd) Vet at her clinic on Wednesday for additional testing, and so they can discuss the case together.

Our urgent concern is that a lot of the displayed symptoms could align with cancer. If this is the case, we want to determine this and try and treat as soon as possible.

This is a [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14NCh3e4V_hAlGUWzlych4oQu0LjJBCv0) to a short video of capturing part of a level 3 episode, a detailed (day/day) excel sheet, and his uranalysis results.

* **Species:** Dog
* **Age:** 13.5+ years
* **Sex/Neuter status:** Male Neutered
* **Breed:** Norwegian Elkhound mix
* **Body weight:** 15.6 kg (as of Aug 31)
* **Your general location:** Saskatchewan, Canada
* **Duration:** Noticeable symptoms/episodes/scares since Jul 31, 2024
* **History (**[**link to detailed history**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14NCh3e4V_hAlGUWzlych4oQu0LjJBCv0)**):**
   * **June 20,** our Dog stepped on something while walking injuring his paw. We tried self treating this until our vet appointment on June 28. We followed our treatment plan which resulted in his paw healing over the next month or so.  His paw took an abnormal amount of time and multiple different treatments before it eventually healed.
   * **Jul 31** our Dog woke us up in the middle of the night for the first time shaking and running around, we describe these as SCARES (maybe a flair-up is a better description). We attributed this to being coned overnight to prevent licking of paw in combination with the treatments being applied to his paw possibly causing some sort of discomfort.
   * **Aug 1** we followed-up with Vet and altered treatment plan
   * Over Aug he started to leave food uneaten, had trouble settling down in the evenings and SCARES started to escalate, to the point a SCARE (or episode of scares was lasting 7 hours)
   * **Aug 16** we revisited the vet and got a new treatment plan
      * The vet diagnosed our Dog with Hip/Tail pain and dementia/Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD)
   * Our Dogs symptoms continued to escalate over the remainder of the month and we were having increasing difficulty communicating with our vet/clinic
   * **Aug 31** we booked an appointment with another Vet/Clinic to get a second opinion
      * We pointed out/called out a pea size lump (hard not moveable) on the left side of his underside of his abdomen (located about where his waistline is) but on his ribs not stomach
      * We haven’t received a diagnosis but are treating CCD and explored Serotonin Syndrome or a neurological issue
      * We started tracking our Dogs activities in detail by the day and build a timeline as best we could date back to June 20
      * We were looking at getting an MRI referral, while discussing symptoms with the vet going forward
   * Since then, our Dog symptoms have generally decreased in severity
      * We have weaned him off Trazodone
      * Put him on a Neurological food
      * Changed his walk schedule from 1, 30+min walk to 3, \~10 min walks per day
      * We dropped off urine and stool for testing
      * Only received the urinalysis results
   * **Sept 14,** we noticed that the pea sized lump was now much larger (possibly an inch in diameter and more flattened.
   * **Sept 22,** we noticed that the size of the lump had decreased and flattened further as well as having appeared to have oozed open some point in the morning around 9am since there was some scabbing in his fur.
   * **Sept 25** – going to the vet in the morning for more testing
      * §  Full bloodwork panel to compare to previous bloodwork done in December 2023
      * §  Fine needle aspiration to test the lump
      * §  Re-examination of the lump and overall physical review by the new vet so that they can discuss with her colleague
* **Clinical signs:**
   * The specific noticeable symptoms are his SCARES/episodes:
      * Our Dog will physically flinch and bolt/ran away from where he is. There seems to be different levels of his SCARES
      * **Level 1:** he will stop and look to us for support or run upstairs and hide on our bed. He may have multiple scares in a short time like 5-10 min or a few over a longer duration like 60 min. but it doesn’t escalate, and he calms down quickly.
      * **Level 2:**  These escalate to the point where he is escaping and digging objects in the house. This can start off the first scare, or he might have multiple scare 1 per minute in s short period which escalate him into this mind set. He is aware of us but trying to escape and highly panicked
      * **Level 3:**  Here he will have all the symptoms of previous levels but try to climb objects/furniture in the house, special awareness isn’t a thing. These episodes last \~7 hours when he was not a medication. Usually these resolve in under 2 hours now.
   * **Symptoms** that **we** (think we) **have not observed**:
* **Medications**
   * FortiFlora k9 Pro SA
      * 7 days, starting Aug 23
   * Bedinvetmad (Librela) Inj K9 10mg/ml/VI
      * Aug 16
   * Cephalexin
      * 7 day antibiotics, start Aug 16
   * 1 OMEGA-3 Fish oil tablet  per day 1200 mg, EPA, 500gm DHA250mg
   * Gabapentin 100 mg Cap,

"Non-NSAID pain relief for 15 year old dachshund?
Hello! First I want to say that I am in regular contact with my vet regarding my dog's care, so this post is for gathering information before I reach out to them again. 

My 15 year old dachshund was on carprofen for mobility for over a year with no issues. He had to go off of it in May to treat a separate medical issue. In that time, he was struggling so I upped the supplement game and got him on more and higher quality joint supplements and nutraceuticals. For his OA, he is currently on green lipped mussel powder, Cosequin, Duralactin, and Ellevet CBD, in addition to gabapentin which he never went off of. Together these all made a big difference but he's not quite at the level he was at on carprofen.  
  
We were recently green lit to start him back NSAIDs. First we decided to try Galliprant since its gentler on the organs. Sadly he had bad side effects and was very lethargic and had less appetite. After tapering the dose, giving with food, and sticking with it for a week (with vet oversight of course), I decided that he was just a little too blah on it and didn't think it was worth it. So we went back to carprofen, which I assumed would be a slam dunk since he tolerated it so well before. Unfortunately, this time he had horrible GI distress that gave him diarrhea and even further appetite loss. He was only on a day and a half before I pulled him off it. He took him about 5 days to fully recover. Vet isn't sure why he's so sensitive this time around.  
  
So it appears that NSAIDs are no longer working for my pup, so I'm wondering if there are any recommendations for other/better supplements to try, or other RX I can ask my vet about? My dog also has neurological issues in the form of canine cognitive dysfunction and had a tiny stroke sometime in the last six months. He's on selegiline and blood thinners for these issues, respectively. I know these meds limit what else he can take, and that there was going to be some risk with him being on NSAIDs and blood thinners at the same time.   
  
I will say that our current regimen is working and he moves pretty well. Stiffer in the morning and sometimes a shaky back hip but far from decrepit, thank goodness. I just want to see if there's anything I can change up to help him even more before I accept our state of affairs. Right now he's on 50mg of gabapentin during the day, along with CBD and other supplements, which helps his mobility but the gabapentin makes him a little more clumsy which we don't need with his CCD. Ideally, we'd turn that down to 25mg during the day if something else could fill in the gap.

Thank you for your advice!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1f2mm9y/nonnsaid_pain_relief_for_15_year_old_dachshund/,,,,,,,,,,,,

 platelets elevated 20k
Pancreatic serum slightly elevated
T4 slightly elevated

Medication: Taking vivtonin as of this week, CBD 2.5 mg 1 drop am 1-2 before bed(regulated and has documentation and such, got through a lab  testinf company) Melatonin 3mg before bed(doggy stuff).

At the vet this week vet commented on tongue looking weird. Jingle wouldn't let her look closer, I've seen it for a while, couldn't pin point when. I brush her teeth daily to every other.
Left side is bigger than right. Sometimes I wonder if she chews it ?
I finally got a photo.

Is this a reason to rush back in? She had a cleaning and extraction in Nov. And nothing was said.

"Senior Shih Tzu mix poss IBD flare since 3/29 
Species: dog
Age: approx 15-17
Sex: male neutered 
Breed: shih tzu mix
Weight: 7.2kg as of 2 weeks ago
Hx: CCD, grade 4 murmur, stage 2 CKD, Hyperparathyroidism secondary to renal disease, hypercalcemia, IBD, IVDD, allergies.
Clinical signs: urgency to poop especially after eating something. 3-8 bowel movements a day with mucus and fresh blood. 
Duration: a little over 3 weeks 

Despite my little old man being riddled with health issues, he’s a happy and sassy little guy. Everything is well managed with medications. 
3 weeks ago - increase in appetite and increase in bowel movements. He usually  poops every other day because of being on Tylosin and very low dose metro. The bowel movements were soft, large in volume, and encased with mucus and fresh blood. After 3 days Urgent Care did a rectal exam and quick ABD US to r/o pancreatitis. US was negative. Started full round of metro + compounded Tylosin. Symptoms persisted with no improvement. **2nd visit to Urgent Care 9 days later**- drop in weight from 7.6kg to 7.2kg. Blood work unremarkable except for mild anemia. Fecal PCR was neg. **Bladder showed mild thickening when collecting sample + trace blood found in urine**. Second round of metro, dc compounded Tylosin, & started trial of Rx GI canned food.  Improvement in consistency of bowel movements, less mucus blood still present. 
Finished 2nd round of metro, refusing to eat RX food, now cooking organic russet potatoes and lean pork for food. No poultry incase this is a developed food allergy. Gave Cytopoint injection, B12 injection, Increased Visbiome probiotics, added goat yogurt for additional gut support, prophylactic daily cerenia. 
Still taking between 4-8 bowel movements a day, small formed nuggets still laced with fresh blood + minimal mucus.
**I need to figure out how to slow down the gastrocolic reflex**. Anytime he ingests a food product he’s stimulated to poop. This has NEVER happened in the past 13 years since I adopted him. 
He’s still bright, alert, ambulating fine, bothers me for treats, and is acting normal despite all of this. I will not put him through rigorous testing due to age, ailments, and stress. **My goal is to keep him comfortable and happy for as long as I can**.
I greatly appreciate any suggestions or direction. Thank you!

"Canine Cognitive Dysfunction
Hi Vets. I'm fostering a cutie right now who is 4/5 yrs old. 

What are early signs of CCD?

She stares at walls a lot, usually while laying down. Most of the time it is usually within 2 arms length. It has decreased though.

I can't tell if that is because of being at the dog shelter for so long prior to coming to us.

"Senior Dog- Anxiety? 
Hi! 

I have an 11 year old rescue dog who I love more than my life. ❤️ Over the past 6 months, I've noticed her acting stiff and sore after our hikes. She was still happy and active, so I asked her vet about dausequin, bought a higher quality senior food, and started trying to make sure she didn't overtire herself on walks. 

About 6 weeks ago, I noticed her panting excessively while we were sitting on the couch together before bed. I timed her breaths- 60-80 per minute- and was very concerned. I took her to the emergency vet, who ran bloodwork, an electrolyte test, and did chest xrays. 

Bloodwork was good except for her liver enzymes, which were high by 2 points. 

Physical exam was unremarkable. 

Her Xray showed no issues except for  arthritis in her middle back and hips,  that I had already been suspecting. 

Vet put her on Rimadyl and Gabapentin and sent her home. The meds have completely resolved her minor, post exercise limpiness, but they have done nothing for that rapid breathing. 

Every night, no matter what, she hyperventilates. She still acts totally normal otherwise- eating, drinking, toileting. I'm so concerned, and confused! I mentioned anxiety to the vet, but she didn't seem sold. She told me to up the gabapentin dosage, which I did. It hasn't helped. 

What could this be? Anxiety? Atypical manifestation of CCD? Uncontrolled pain? Hidden lung issues? 

Thank you for reading this far! I'd be grateful for any advice that could help my girl. 🙏",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ayopkp/senior_dog_anxiety/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"At a loss about what’s happening with my senior dog despite being a final year vet student
Hello, I’m looking for insight into what might be the best approach to my senior dog as it seems to be a complicated case and all the vets at my uni have had vastly different opinions!

- Roughly 13yo (he was a stray so mystery background) MN Pomeranian x
- Rescued him around 2.5 years ago
- Only previous history I have from the rescue org is that his left eye was removed due to what was thought to be a deep ulcer that had become completely keratinised and he was blind in that eye, plus some spondylosis and narrowed disc space in his lumbar region
- Recent bloods and urinalysis from this week and one year ago were unremarkable

The problem:
A few weeks ago I was away on rural placement for a week and my partner said our dog woke up in the middle of the night yelping before managing to settle again. The next day he was still yelling sporadically when touched or approached. I told my partner to take him to the local vet who couldn’t localise any pain but thought it might be an acute arthritis flare up so he was given some carprofen. 

That seemed to work wonders up until a week ago where he woke up in the middle of the night screaming in pain, it was very loud and very distressing. I thought perhaps he might be constipated as he was looking hunched over and like he wanted to go outside but nothing happened. Strangely he was ok with being picked up and fed treats during this time. I took him to the vet and they gave us some trazodone and gabapentin on top of his carprofen and suggested a CT to investigate any spinal problems, and he seemed ok after, however yesterday morning he had another episode in the middle of the night. I was on placement at a hospital with an emergency department so I took him with me to be monitored there for the day. The vet there also thought it was an acute arthritis flare up and said she could give him a buprenorphine injection to see if that helped. I honestly couldn’t tell because he was so zonked out after. That night he was crying again, it almost seemed as if he was distressed from being so disoriented while recovering from the bupe.

Since then he has been ok and we have continued on the carprofen/traz/gaba but he’s still not quite himself.

My question is whether or not this could be something neurological ie CCD or brain tumour? He has definitely been acting more senile and these always seem to happen at night like some sort of sundowner syndrome. Another question of mine is whether it could be some sort of PTSD - one night after we first got him my boyfriend’s dog inexplicably decided to move to my dog’s bed in the middle of the night and it gave them both a fright and they had a go at each other. My dog was behaving very similar to now and was shaken up but recovered fine and that was over a year ago. He does seem to be more settled when sleeping in the living room.

Very interested to hear any vet’s thoughts as I am completely stumped and just want my little man back to his cheery self again ☹️

"My dog is 20 years old blind, deaf, with dementia and arthritis. Is it time?
My dog is a maltese who is 20 years old. She has arthritis, is blind, deaf and with dementia. 

I took my dog last year to the vet because I thought she was ready to cross the rainbow bridge. However, my vet who is a holistic vet told me she was still healthy and didn't recommend euthenizing her yet. However, she barks excessively out of nowhere at all hours. She rest a lot which I understand. I feel bad for her since she is blind she is always bumping into things and we have to guide her. She can't control her bladder any nore and will pee anywhere. When I pick her up I can feel the arthritis. The vet also mentioned she might have dementia. I feel it in my heart she has to go but after the vet said no I feel like I must let her die naturally. Everyday I hear her bark for no reason it hurts me emotionally. 

I am lost in making a decision, but I am pretty sure of what needs to happen. Can you all provide some guidance? Is she in pain or is she still okay to live?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ebnok9/my_dog_is_20_years_old_blind_deaf_with_dementia/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Sorry you are struggling with the 'is it time' decision. I have been there twice in the past year, so I know it's a hard place to be in with a pet. Our vet told us they are of the opinion, ""It's better to error on the side of too soon rather than a second too late."" If you have the option to do in home euthanasia I highly recommend it as it made the whole ordeal far easier for both us and our dogs.

When we were trying to determine how long to wait with the first dog we lost this year (terminal and on borrowed time) I reached out to my cousin who is a veterinary oncologist for help evaluating quality of life. She shared the guidance she gives her patients with me, and it really helped us gauge the timing.

""To monitor your pet's quality of life, pick 5 things they like to do the most. These can be small things like perking up for a ride in the car, playing with a certain toy, napping in a certain spot. Daily, your pet should be doing 3 of its 5 favorite things for it to be considered a good day. If there is a change to only doing 2 of the 5 favorite things, and we are having more bad days then good days in a 7-day period, we need to decide if we are doing everything we can for your pet's comfort, or if euthanasia would be the most appropriate option.""

I know it's especially hard with older dogs who've had a slow decline. The thing your vet seems to be ignoring is that natural death of an elderly dog can be slow - most of us don't have the good fortune to have a situation where they just pass peacefully in their sleep - and they might not always show signs of pain and discomfort until it's pretty severe. You can talk to the vet about medication for pain and arthritis, but if the dog is older and already having issues with bladder/kidney/liver, etc., certain medications can put extra stress on those systems and might lead to other issues, so you'll have to discuss with the vet and weigh the risks/benefits of medicating a 20-year-old dog.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ebnok9/my_dog_is_20_years_old_blind_deaf_with_dementia/#lexgdko,,,,,,,,,,,,

"conflicted - dog with dementia
my dog recently turned 13 , and hes a dachshund/basset hound mix. hes now blind and deaf, due to his old age, and he has had a heart problem since last year, which is under control under medication. he also has a small hernia on his butt, which isnt really keeping him from walking, and a small bump on his eyelid, which sometimes bleeds (we dont know if its cancerous but were pretty sure its just a blocked tear duct). but for the most part it doesnt bother him. the problem is, he has been having reoccurring ear infections, his ear canals arent really visible and his ears produce a lot of wax. we have tried a bunch of antibiotics and other remedies but they keep coming back, i think theyre chronic, but the only sign of discomfort he shows is after we bathe him, where he will shake his head for a good 15 minutes. for a week now, hes also been showing signs of dementia, during the evenings he has this routine where he paces around for a good 15 minutes and then sleeps for 5 - and the cycle continues until bedtime, and sometimes he whines and barks. my parents are convinced hes in pain and they believe he has no quality of life being blind and deaf. despite sleeping most of the day, he still gets up and seeks us out for pets, when someone gets home and he realizes it (since hes deaf and blind) he will go up to the door, he still wags his tail, he still eats (a lot because hes very greedy) and drinks water normally, he stills pulls me when we go on walks, the only thing he has stop caring about really is his toys. i dont know what to do or feel, hes my childhood dog, i dont know if its me not knowing how to cope with his loss or if hes fine for the most part. my parents have putting him down on their mind. pls help.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hpwqc4/conflicted_dog_with_dementia/,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm at aloss as to how to help him/deal with this. Any suggestions?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1evry2p/sudden_onset_dementia_in_a_dog/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"first, thanks to all who responded. He has occasional seizures, usually very short lived, and he recovers fully. Our vet has tried different seizure meds, none have completely eliminated them.

His ""dementia"" behavior lasted for almost 36hrs: circling, whining, not recognizing the other dog or the cats, or me. He has separation anxiety-and the whining, searching for ""mom""?, behavior happens whenever I leave for a time.                              

He's never not recognized anyone before. 

We woke up today and he seems very close to normal. I'm ""mom"" again!!!

I have no financial ability to do another vet visit fir the same thing, but am maintaining his medication as needed.

Again, thank you all, I will update as needed.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1evry2p/sudden_onset_dementia_in_a_dog/#lj3wk1q,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Change in Behavior in Elderly Dog - Dementia? 
Hi all, 

  
My dog is turning 14 in a few months. I've had her since she was very small, and she is precious to me. In the last 6 months or so, I've noticed some behavioral changes that I don't fully understand. Here are some details:

  
Around 9 months ago, we brought home a cat, a very active and young Bengal. He frequently teases and upsets the dog, and it's clear his behavior is somewhat stressful to her. 

Perhaps 2-3 months later, I noticed the dog no longer responding when called, and not listening when I gave her directions. At first I thought this might be stubbornness and obstinance, due to the cat. However, she also stopped waking when I came in the door, and seemed to be less aware when I moved around the room. This lead me to believe she was experiencing hearing loss instead. What was puzzling, was how apparently rapid the onset was. I have also noticed she has basically stopped requesting to play, which had no apparent connection.

Maybe 2 months ago, she began drinking more water, and having lots of accidents in the house. I took her to a vet and they reported her physically healthy (they did blood tests and urinalysis) but prescribed a medication we might try for incontinence. 48 hours later and she was in severe discomfort, and having accidents every 5 minutes. I took her back in, and they found she had developed a UTI, the first in her life. After the UTI I took her off the incontinence medication, and found she was still having accidents. I put her back on it, and found no change in behavior.

Sometime after this I noticed she no longer seems to want to go outside or to the park across the street. This has been something she greatly enjoyed in the past.

Lately she has been waking up in the middle of the night. I wake up when she does and follow her. She will typically drink for 5-10 minutes, maybe 3-400ml (she's 5kg and this seems like a lot), and then immediately pee on the floor. I have observed she no longer asks to go outside, but she also doesn't pee in her bed or where she's standing. 

Now, I frequently will let her out pre-emptively. She will typically walk just outside the door, pee on the concrete, turn around and come back inside. In the past she has had a strong preference to pee in grass.

I can't figure out the behaviors. Is she incontinent? Is it cognitive decline? Stress? Something else? Why is she not asking to be let out? Why is she drinking so much, with no indicators of a change in physical health? Why is she not asking to play? Can she really not hear, or is she not comprehending? Have we missed something in the health screenings, or is it entirely cognitive?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1dvhq7k/change_in_behavior_in_elderly_dog_dementia/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My dog has dementia and is aggressive, is it possibly time to euthanise him?
My dog is elderly and has developed dementia. Until now it's been symptoms of confusion and sometimes fear. Now he's starting to be aggressive at random. I have a 10 month old and live in a very small flat. I have no way to keep my baby and dog apart without confining one of them to a very small space for most of the day. 

My dog is about 15, has dementia, he is on medication for arthritis pains, and expensive prescription food because he is prone to pancreatitis. With the aggression on top I don't see how he could be rehomed. 

The only reason I am unsure is that he seems happy 90% of the time. But I have no way to give him a good quality of life now. I feel like if he is put to sleep, it's my fault for not providing enough though...",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/k3w7t3/my_dog_has_dementia_and_is_aggressive_is_it/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"You provided a loving home to the best of your ability for his whole life. Unpredictable aggression is just as valid a negative symptom as any other reason to let a pet pass from this world. 
In a small environment with a young child, these symptoms will not go away, and in fact may worsen with time. You would be ensuring your family's best safety by creating final memories with your pet, and offer the dignity of a peaceful transition without the tarnish of an incident that can't be taken back, and wasn't intentional. 
I know its difficult and feels morally grey, as his body hasn't ""failed"" yet. But the mind failing is just as much a part of the body. No one at the office will judge you. 
In the end you know him best and can make the right decision for your family. But I do believe you are in the end game now and should not feel guilty. 🫂",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/k3w7t3/my_dog_has_dementia_and_is_aggressive_is_it/#ge5frtu,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I know the aggression is scary for you, especially with your baby. But it's also likely very scary for your dog. Aggression is a reaction to some bad emotions (e.g. fear) and is not an enjoyable state of mind for your dog.

Regardless of your decision, you have taken care of this dog for so long, and shown him so much love. Don't lose sight of that.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/k3w7t3/my_dog_has_dementia_and_is_aggressive_is_it/#ge5j7s7,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I look at it this way: let him go, now, on good terms, in love. Don't wait for him to no longer ""seem happy"". Don't wait till you become a stranger, or worse. You have the opportunity to send him off in relative peace. And it'll help begin your grief process.

Waiting until he becomes a burden to himself, and/or you, won't benefit either of you.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/k3w7t3/my_dog_has_dementia_and_is_aggressive_is_it/#ge663mg,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"From one pet parent to another, I’m sorry that you’re going through this now. The fact that you are even debating this decision and seeking advice demonstrates what a wonderful pet parent you are.

My vet provided me with this [OSU diagnostic] (https://vet.osu.edu/vmc/sites/default/files/import/assets/pdf/hospital/companionAnimals/HonoringtheBond/HowDoIKnowWhen.pdf) to better determine when it may be time to euthanize. It can be helpful in minimizing the likelihood of feeling like you’re second-guessing yourself. 

That said, my vet did say that, even if most of the  diagnostic points are not met, good pet parents usually have an idea of when it might be time to euthanize given the specifics of the situation. Based on what you’ve shared, it seems you are there. 

It won’t make it any easier, but from an outside perspective it sounds like you are making the right decision. Right now, although he’s experiencing significant cognitive decline, your dog still knows you and loves you and knows how much you love him. Give him a really good day together and then be with him as he goes. That’s truly the kindest thing you can do for him.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/k3w7t3/my_dog_has_dementia_and_is_aggressive_is_it/#ge6lus2,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Not a vet

I would first discuss this with the vet to rule out any treatable medical issues causing the aggression. But yes, euthanasia is a perfectly valid option.

As someone who has had to make this same decision, it is not your fault.

There are diseases that we cannot cure. A disease (or old age) that is causing aggression is not something he would want. You have had him for years, do you truly believe he would want to hurt you or your family if he wasn't being affected by this disease? In this scenario, a humane euthanasia is a blessing, not a curse. He gets to go our remembering your love, not feeling like he was abandoned in a strange place, and not feeling bad because he unintentionally harmed you.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/k3w7t3/my_dog_has_dementia_and_is_aggressive_is_it/#ge62e0f,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Better a day early than a day late. New unexpected aggression in an elderly dog is absolutely a factor in putting them down. Dogs aren't happy when they are being aggressive, add on dementia and you likely have yourself a very scared, confused and upset dog.

"can dogs get dementia?
My approximately 12 year old dog is showing unusual signs of pacing in the evenings. Sometimes, he just abruptly stops for a few minutes and just stares into space. At times, he walks to the corner of the room & just stares. He also wants to go outside every 20 minutes or so repeatedly. He goes out one door, circles around the house & comes in another door. 
It reminds me of a person with dementia who is sundowning.

"Does my dog have dementia or something else
My dog is around 6-7 years old. We found him almost starved on a beach un Ecuador when he was about a year old. He was full of ticks. It turned out he had erlichiosis and we treated him with several rounds of antibiotics until it wasn't traceable anymore. We had him tested for all tropical diseases when we got back home and they were all negative.

For about a year he has been having episodes where I feel he's not himself. I feel he is afraid and comes to one of us ( my husband or me) looking to be comforted but when we touch him he bites. Then he snaps back into his normal self and seems distressed by what happened. Most of the time he is normal and happy and we can cuddle hin no problem. We have been doing dehaviorak therapy he gets sedarom tablets as a mood stabiliser and have been doing behavioural therapy, he is not in pain, we tried physio therapy and we did a full body x Ray with no issues visible. He is castrated and has been for years. We regularly go mantrailing and he gets 3 -4 walks a day. He has some food sensitivities, basically he can't eat anything orange, like carrots or pumpkin, but we have those under control and take good care of his nutritional needs. He is a mixed race 23 kg medium sized  dog. We are convinced there is a lot of herding dog in him.

Those episodes are happening more often and are getting worse and it's incredibly unpredictable.  It also not just a little bite, it's very aggressive, rage-like.

We are becoming hopeless, it's starting to become too dangerous since we have a child, we can't risk him having an episode when she near him. 

I just want to know what is happening and if there is a chance we can still help him become himself again. Could the malnourishiment in his youth have something to do with it? Could it be some form of early dementia or some other disease? I am so desperate I need my dog back.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/17jbjtk/does_my_dog_have_dementia_or_something_else/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Dementia in Dogs
How is dementia assessed in dogs.

I have a foster pup that I believe has dementia but the rescue says “she was tested and does not have dementia”.

Since I’ve had this dog I’ve discovered a heart murmur and that she’s deaf.

I’m concerned that if they didn’t disclose the heart murmur or the deafness to me prior to letting me foster her (they claim not to know she’s deaf), then maybe they’re not aware of the dementia?

Essentially I’m curious to know what a dementia test for a dog includes, and if they really did test her for dementia is there any way they really didn’t know about the deafness or heart murmur?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16sc8rm/dementia_in_dogs/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My roommate's dog is acting crazy, restless and getting into the trash worse than ever - I don't know if it's flea leftovers, dementia, or something from eating goose poop?
I honestly don't know where to go with this question and I've tried googling it but it seems like there are too many possibilities. My roommate's dog is an 11-12? y/o small dog, and although he's always been nasty in a more playful way, he's been an absolute menace lately. He'll bark at night when my roommate takes him to bed - and sometimes it's that he has to poo, but other times taking him outside to do his business becomes a gauntlet of stopping him from spending his entire time eating goose poo. He also just refuses to sleep upstairs some days - I'm not sure if it's just that he prefers to sleep in the dirty laundry I have on the floor down in my room. Here are a few things I think might be wrong, but I'd really appreciate anything anyone might have to say.

1. He recently had fleas, and I believe my roommates said he still has flea dirt. Part of his craziness involves scratching, and I'm sure that's some of the discomfort -- but also we've given him several baths since he was treated for the fleas, and we haven't seen any adult fleas on him so it's shocking if it would make him behave in this way. He's become more aggressive, figuring out how to tear over the kitchen trash can for example, which we never used to have to worry about him doing.
2. He is pretty old, so some of the ""feral"" seeming aspects of his behavior have made me wonder if he's developing dementia or something? I still don't think this would explain why he's become so much more erratic and wild.
3. He hasn't been going on enough long walks maybe? All of my roommates have schedules that conflict in such a way he doesn't get taken on as long of walks as he used to - or just get taken in the yard rather than full walks. But also, this change happened quite a bit before he was so restless. So I don't know if he would really get tired out, or if he would still be hyperactive because he's uncomfortable?
4. This dog has been eating lots of goose and turkey poo from the local fauna, and surely the poo of some other wild animals - plus he was frequently getting into the cat's litter box in the time before he started going crazy. His taste for gross stinky things was nothing new, but the way he now seems to forego actually peeing or pooping while he's in the yard in favor of sniffing for poo like a truffle pig... just makes me have the wild conspiracy theory the poop has something to do with it. Does he have some kind of bug?

I'm not sure if this is really the right kind of thing to post here, but I just thought I'd put it somewhere in case anyone could help and let me know if these behavioral issues could be caused by anything that's going on with this dog. It's gotten to the point where we're always frustrated by him rather than giving him and I want to try and help the guy get whatever it is he needs to become the chill cuddly gremlin I first met.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16pzct6/my_roommates_dog_is_acting_crazy_restless_and/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Questions about dogs and dementia/Alzheimer
Hello, first time posting here, I am sorry if I make any mistakes. English is not my first language, so I apologize if the text is a bit confusing.
I have a senior dog, a 16y Shitzu. Just to give some background, he has heart issues (heart murmur) and is partially blind. He cries a lot, but in the past month he started to cry all night long, so we took him to the vet and did a lot of exams. The doctor said he doesn't feel pain, but actually is demented because of low oxygen in the brain. 
So my question is, how is the quality of life of a dog in such situation? The doc said he doesn't feel pain and isn't suffering, but I don't understand why he cries so much? What do veterinarians know about such types of diseases in dogs?
Also, do you have any tips to make his life more comfortable? We will start to give him more diverse food, to stimulate his brain activity.
Any help will be greatly appreciated!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/15nq2z3/questions_about_dogs_and_dementiaalzheimer/,,,,,,,,,,,,

My older dog is around 13 (she's a family pet and no one can remember exactly). She is a mix between a pug and a shih-tzh, although i have no idea as to the purity of her parents or their physical health. She is neutered and previously needed a lot of teeth pulled. She only eats wet food now, but she still has some teeth left.

Since about 2 weeks ago, she has become incredibly restless, specially at night. Every hour or 2, she'll whine or bark me or my boyfriend out of bed, because it's late and i can't let her annoy the neighbours. 
When we check up on her, one of two things will happen.
Either she'll run to the door to go outside, or she'll wag her tail at me and whine some more.
Outside, most often she will go potty. Say, 3 out of 5 times. The other times, she will sit outside and stare or sniff, or scratch her butt on the tiles, and bark and whine more. She seems to have no reall reason for wanting to go outside, is what I'm saying.

If she doesn't seem to want to go outside, i stay with her a second but i don't pet her. In my limited knowledge of training pets, i think that would reinforce her to bark more to get pet. She'll wag her tail at me, or bark or whine at me. 
She might whine for a bit longer when i go upstairs to bed, but she quiets down within a minute and it's not loud at all.

Since also 2 weeks ago, we have been in the process of moving houses. We're packing up and have been staying over at the new house with her. At the new house, she seems quite relaxed during the day, but whenever we leave for an hour or 3 she will most likely poop inside. She basically never pees inside though. 
She also sometimes poops inside during the night, even though i am downstairs and could let her outside every 2 hours. At this point she poops in the living room nearly once a day, sometimes twice a night, so it really averages to daily.
She was previously very house trained and almost never had accidents. I could stay out for up to 8 hours comfortably, so long as i walked her well before i went.

She also licks her thighs a lot, to the point of causing scabs there. 
She has very dry and seemingly itchy skin in her left ear. My boyfriend's mother suggested vaseline would help.

Do you see any behaviours or symptoms i would need to go to the vet for? I understand skin conditions are near impossible to diagnose over text. 
I haven't slept well in weeks and I'm getting increasingly desperate. Should i ask for anxiety medication for my dog? We are in the Netherlands by the way, not America. 

In my eyes, to summarize, i have an anxious old dog in a new environment, who also has some itches here and there, who barks me out of bed every 2 hours or so because she's anxious and itchy.

Thanks so much! I'm going back to sleep, so I'm very sorry but i can answer questions during the day.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/15wyiew/older_dog_is_very_restless_doesnt_seem_to_have/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Dog with dementia/anxiety
Hello vets!

Species: dog
Age: 11 years 7 months
Sex/neuter status: female/spayed
Breed: blue nose pit bull
Body weight: 69 lbs.
History: 3 mast cell tumor removals. Anxiety during car rides following crash experience. Within the past year, she had an episode of HGE as well as being diagnosed with dementia, arthritis, and COPD [MEDICAL RECORD IN COMMENTS]
Clinical signs: (I apologize—I’m unclear on what this means, but I will answer based on my interpretation) excessive unexplained whining, compulsive licking, occasionally confused demeanor, hacking/coughing, a few instances of house soiling, difficulty climbing/descending stairs, noticeably slowed movement. Recently she awoke from deep sleep panting heavily while in a cool room and did not stop for atleast 20 minutes, then proceeded to obsessively lick her paws for over an hour.
Duration: the unexplained whining, licking, and general anxiety began about 18 months ago and has progressively become more severe. The breathing/coughing symptoms only developed within the last month or so and improved after a course of antibiotics but are still present.
General location: northeast US
Links to relevant info: I am not allowed to post links here, but will in comments

The decline in my best friend’s health began suddenly and worsened rapidly. I am concerned about and seeking a second opinion on several concerns, and would appreciate any advice to promote superior care and comfort for my dog.

Over this past year, Bella Jane’s dementia and resulting symptoms have progressively worsened. The vet prescribed trazadone to help her feel more calm and relaxed during anxious times, especially during the evenings. Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics. I am having difficulty differentiating between panting due to anxiety and panting due to breathing issues.

Thanks so much if you made it this far, and TIA for advice/recommendations!!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13hp4gc/dog_with_dementiaanxiety/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I completely understand the turmoil that comes with euthanising a family member. I have sympathy for you and your family.

However, I do agree with your husband that it may be time to consider euthanasia. I absolutely do not agree with the reasoning ‘tired of her having accidents’, but I think it is important to note that this incontinence is a symptom of your dogs’ demise.

Just because your dog is not actively ‘shutting down’ does not mean she is ‘healthy’, at all. The term ‘healthy’ was misused by your vet. A more rounded approach would be: External to dementia, deafness, blindness, and incontinence, your dogs’ vital signs are typical.

Personally, I would plan to euthanise your dog in the near future. Not right away, but I would definitely begin to process this loss. I will not say processing the loss in advance will make it ‘easier’, but it will definitely make you feel more in control of the situation, and allow you to plan to let your pet go however you would like to do so. It allows you to organise a home euthanasia or in-office euthanasia, choose a vessel for your dogs’ remains, print pictures, and allow family members to say goodbye.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hy9biz/my_husband_is_pushing_me_to_put_our_dog_down/#m6fmg11,,,,,,,,,,,,

If I couldn't remember what house I was in, where anything was, was peeing all over the house, couldn't hear, see, or think, was constantly anxious and pacing, I would be pretty miserable. I would have to side with your husband. I think you gave her a wonderful life, and according to what you said the quality is not there. If it was just accidents, that's one thing.

"Looking for advice for a senior dog with doggie dementia. Euthanasia is in the talks, but his body is still fine, having a hard time making a decision.
Hello Reddit, here looking for some heavy advice. 

My dog Diesel, is a 13yo Shar-pei, intact male, approx 65lbs. 

We first started noticing symptoms about a year or so ago, but the episodes were spread apart in the beginning. Now they're coming on with alarming frequency, and our dog isn't the same as he once was. He gets lost in the yard, if we call him to go pee he'll forget what's going on halfway to the door, pacing, obsessively shaking his ears even with no infection, and sometimes just stop to shake and pant anxiously. 

The thing that has us worried is when he's touched when he's sleeping. Diesel is the chillest dog, has never bitten dogs back (even when he had grounds to) and has barked maybe 6 times in his life. But lately whenever we brush against him while he's sleeping he's up in arms, snarling, snapping and barking. It is so unlike him that it has us staring at him like he's a different dog, because he his. He's fine once we reassure him he's okay and he's had a few moments to get out of a sleep haze.

We understand old man dog pains and have been giving him CBD oil sprayed in his food. That has helped tremendously with him going up stairs, jumping up and down on the couch, and his mood has improved a lot. But it hasn't helped with the other dementia symptoms and being startled awake. 

It's so frustrating because he poos and pees where he's supposed to, eats and drinks the same (enthusiastically), and still moves around relatively well for a dog 2 years past his expiry date. 

Diesel hasn't been to a vet in a while, he's never done well with them, and since he hasn't had any major health issues we decided to not stress him out like that in his old age. To be brutally honest, he's been an old man for so long we never thought he'd last this long. While we are grateful to have him so long being a healthy and amazing dog, we never expected this outcome.

At home euthanasia is in the talks within the next few months, but we're stuck in this limbo of wondering if this is too soon or if his quality of life is worth more than keeping him longer.  It's so frustrating to see him still able to move around fine, but his mind is definitely going. We'd hate to have one of our nieces or nephews get attacked because they startled him, it's not at that point, but we'd rather it didn't either. 

When is the right time with doggie dementia?

EDIT: to add the reason why he startles awake so much is because he's really attached to my side since this has been going down. The problem is I have severe ADHD and even with medication/therapy I move around and fidget a lot. I try to move away from him so I don't disturb him, but he always snuggles closer and chooses to keep laying down beside me even after I startle him awake 5 times :( I do my best, but it's really hard",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/stid2u/looking_for_advice_for_a_senior_dog_with_doggie/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Adopting a dog with Dementia?
Hello! My husband and I (late 20s) have wanted an adult dog for a while. We frequently check the local animal shelter site for dogs that we feel would be a good fit for our family. Recently, a dog was listed and he sounded like a great fit. He’s 8 years old, good with cats (we have two) and good with kids. He’s also still moderately active. I sent in the application to adopt him and the shelter called to tell me that he has canine dementia, and wanted to see if that was a deal breaker for us. It isn’t necessarily a deal breaker, but it does give me pause. I want to make sure we would be a good home for him. Apparently he is on medication for this, and his foster parent told me he still functions very well and only paces sometimes. My question for the Vets of Reddit is: what is the timeline like for this condition, and how can I expect it to progress? For back ground he is a collie/terrier mix (they think) and weighs about 25 pounds. Thanks!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/ucp6l4/adopting_a_dog_with_dementia/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Dog dementia advice
I am new here and I have a 14.5 year old dog, around 25-28 kilos, mixed breed. He has always had good health, and is neutered. Recently he has been showing signs of dementia, pacing, nervousness, anxiety, sundowning. He has always been on the phobic side, but this has now gone up tenfold. I was able to get away with him not barking (as he would usually wake me at 2 am, short barks which I recognize as being scared, and anxious) by allowing to roam in the garden in my fenced property. He would stop, but recently he wants to see me all the time. If he gets in my bedroom he wants to get on my bed, but since he has incontinence I can’t keep cleaning sheets, mattress etc, in the middle of the night. 
I live somewhere in Europe in a small house with a garden, which means there are not many rooms I could isolate him in. I love my dog to death, but I keep getting up several times per night and it’s taking a toll on my work performance and physical/mental health. Vets here aren’t so specialized as in the US and they have no idea of the drug selegiline (Anipril.) Also they don’t prescribe or have some benzo for dogs. My vet which are really one of the best in the city told me to give him Anxitane, cbd oil and special brain diet. 
How long does it take for anxitane to work, and /or the cbd oil? 
Dog is otherwise healthy, hard of hearing, but recognizes anyone he knows, wags his tail, will play occasionally and has a good appetite.

"I think my dog has dementia
I just need some advice. My boyfriend and I suspect that our dog, Mya 14 y/o short pitbull 58lbs,  has doggy dementia. He got her off of Craigslist from a really 💩 situation (dog wise), she was kept in a crate 90% of the time in a small apartment, (as far as we know) wasn’t vaccinated but was spayed, never went on walks and was horribly overweight. 

We’ve had her for 3 years now, and it seems her health is declining, and fast. This is the 3rd time in a year now that this has happened. She wakes up from a nap, wants to go outside, we take her out, she wanders around, call her in, she doesn’t listen, we carry her in, she begs to go back out, so on and so forth. Recently, it’s turned into her whining and screaming to go outside, pushing herself into the door and getting herself stuck. 

I’ve done some research but, of course, we’d have to take her to the vet to get diagnosed. We have absolutely no money to take her to the vet and the prices here have just gone up drastically (We just moved to CA our vet is in NV since we’re on the state border) , and doesn’t help that we have another dog who’s meds are $205 every time we have to order them (every month or so).

,We cannot legally give any type of diagnosis here. Dogs can get dementia as they age but it’s impossible to say if that’s what you’re seeing without a physical exam.

"How do I get a dog away from my grandfather with dementia?
EDIT: The facility DOES allow dogs. When they were looking for assisted living places, they were specifically looking for places that allowed pets. Which I wish my mom had not entertained that, but here we are.

Hello Vets-

I figured you all probably see this at some point or another: an older patient with dementia who cannot remember to take care of their pet anymore. But their doctor thinks the pet is good for them to have.

I want to preface with my position. I want to get the dog out of his care as soon as possible. I think it's way beyond time and I believe the situation is dire. I think my mother is making it more difficult than it needs to be, though I do understand dealing with dementia patients is difficult. I have posted this scenario in r/dementia and r/alzheimers as well in hopes of all the advice I can possibly get.

I previously posted about my grandfather [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/o4ylse/how_do_we_take_the_dogs_away_xpost_from_rdementia/). Things have progressed and I'd very much appreciate some insight. My mother is POA and sort of the unofficial caregiver, but does not live with him. He doesn't have any other family members in the area.

Shortly after that post, one of the dogs was put down. We are unsure exactly what happened, but she was throwing up and apparently miserable. I believe Papa was talking about ""putting her down"" like, ""in the backyard"" if you catch my drift. This was alarming. My mom convinced him to try a medication the vet had suggested.

The short version of the story is that the dogs looked very similar and the wrong dog was getting the medication and therefore the sick dog did not improve and therefore got euthanized by the vet. To say I'm horrified about this is an understatement.

The remaining dog (11 year old yellow lab) is overweight, arthritic, currently has a double ear infection, and recently sprained an elbow. Supposedly she fell off the bed. She is 110% not getting medicated for arthritis, nor is she getting the care she needs for her ears, because Papa does not remember to do this. Who knows what else is falling through the cracks.

He loves the dog. But also apparently is starting to forget he has a dog. I guess he asked my mom last night ""where did this dog come from?"". But also still thinks he has two dogs sometimes. His GP and Neurologist seem to think it's good for him to have the dog. Do they know about the state of the dog? I do not know. My mom claims the vet also knows the situation but I really don't think that's true. I honestly get the feeling she's lying to me about that so I don't keep pressuring her to get the dog out of his care faster than she wants.

Papa is moving in to an assisted living facility this month. My mom is trying to work in conversations about the dog coming to stay with me/my husband while he moves in and then hopefully he'll just forget about her. My mom is convinced this isn't going to work and Papa will get belligerent. I guess she's brought it up a couple times before and it hasn't gone over well...the general idea of the dog coming to live with me.

Quite frankly I don't give a shit if he likes it or not. This dog is suffering and needs to be taken care of and no one is taking care of her. Papa is already forgetting her and how many dogs he does/does not have. I know the doctors think the dog is good for him, but it's not good for HER.

What can/should I do? Can the vet do something? Should I actually try to get in contact with the vet myself? Please, any advice would be helpful.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/q2snz6/how_do_i_get_a_dog_away_from_my_grandfather_with/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Disclosure: Former vet tech, not a vet.

Does the assisted living facility he is going to allow dogs? If not, there really isn't much to argue about. You could soften the blow by offering to arrange visits with her.

If they do, find out if they have staff available to assist with the dog. Also find out if her current vet can make house calls or send a tech to pick her up for appointments. The office I worked at did this for a small fee, but the distance was limited to a small area.

The other option would be to hire someone that can come over daily to take care of her, but that can be cost prohibitive.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/q2snz6/how_do_i_get_a_dog_away_from_my_grandfather_with/#hfo5yvb,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Not a vet.  Does he have a choice?  Is it even an option to take the dog to assisted living?

Especially if the answer to that question is no, I think this is a situation where taking possession of the dog will be fairly simple, and the hard part will be dealing with the emotional fallout.  I can’t think of any special abilities that the vet would have to manage this situation - if they thought the dog was in danger, the most extreme thing they’d do would be to call animal protection, which you and your family could also do.  If you’re thinking the vet could talk to your grandpa and make him see reason, that’s also something that your family could do.  (Unless you have reason to believe that your grandpa would be way more receptive to this conversation coming from the vet.)

It’s a tough situation, I’m sorry.  I hope things are able to work out as well as possible for everyone involved.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/q2snz6/how_do_i_get_a_dog_away_from_my_grandfather_with/#hfo6juh,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Not a vet.

Just some things to think about.

Is there no happy medium here? If he's moving to an assisted living facility, he likely won't be able to take the dog anyway. Can you (or your mom, or someone) go over to make sure the dog's needs are being met for the few weeks until he moves? Maybe work with him to take the dog for a few ""visits"" with you in the meantime, maybe a few days at a time...longer each time until she's just living with you? That will help him AND the dog with the transition. 

I know that you want what's best for the dog, and I can definitely appreciate that. But don't forget compassion for your grandfather in this. His entire life is turned upside down, and he can't even understand what is going on a lot of the time. I've worked with a lot of Alzheimers/dementia patients, and the number one emotion they feel is FEAR. They don't remember things, but (especially in the ""middle stages,"" if you will) they realize they don't remember. But they don't know why. They know something is very wrong, but they can't grasp what it is, and they can't fix it. Your grandpa knows something is wrong with him, he just doesn't know what or why. Now one dog has died, the other is sick, he's having to move...this is HARD on him. It's not a matter of him ""not liking it,"" EVERYTHING is major to him now. He's likely to have a bad reaction. That doesn't mean that it doesn't have to be done, but try to do it with as much compassion as you can. 

Something else to consider is that the dog is likely having a hard time as well. I have an 11 year old lab mix. We lost our other dog, to whom she was very bonded, back in June. She's not been the same since. Your grandpa's dog lost her companion, now her person is changing, and things are crazy around her. I think snatching her away without some transition, or at least visits would be a disservice to her, as well. 

Best of luck. Some situations don't have a black and white solution, as much as we wish they did.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/q2snz6/how_do_i_get_a_dog_away_from_my_grandfather_with/#hfo9fc2,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I’m sorry you’re all in this situation. This has got to be tough on everyone. Thank you for looking out for that sweet dog. 

If pets aren’t allowed at the facility, it sounds like she’ll be moving in with you this month anyway. If you could, I would try to make sure someone is stopping by daily to ensure she’s being cared for until this move happens. Also when this move occurs, make sure to get it in writing that he’s no longer able to care for her and ownership has passed to you, as it’s possible the vet would like to confirm she’s your pet now. 

As for your grandpa, is it possible to have her visit the facility or bring him to see her occasionally? I have heard that animal companionship is very beneficial for Alzheimer’s patients. They also sell those soft, sleeping  fake pets that I personally feel are sort of creepy BUT I’ve heard some patients really respond well to. 

I think your best bet is to probably wait out his move and try to care for her as best you can until then. I understand his doctor thinks she’s an important asset for his mental stimulation, and I’m sure she is, but it does seem it’s gotten to the point that it is not in her best interest to continue to live with him.

"Senior dog with cognitive dysfunction/dementia causing extreme anxiety. Ways to soothe/sedate?
Our 13 year old rescue mutt has been in gradual cognitive decline and is experiencing major anxiety/panic as a result (vet has ruled out other causes of the behavior.)

It has reached the point that he is spending more time freaked out than not, so we made the tough decision that it’s time to say goodbye and we have an appointment for that on Friday. 

In the meantime, I’m desperately looking for any suggestions for ways to calm and soothe him. Over the past several months we (with our vet) have tried Benadryl, trazodone, gabapentin, assorted dietary changes and supplements, CBD, thunder shirt, increased exercise and stimulation, and nothing has made the slightest impact. Even at crazy high doses, none of the sedative meds we have tried have made him at all sleepy or calmed him down at all.

When he’s in panic mode, he paces non-stop, pants super heavily, bats with his paw at anyone and anything in reach, tries to climb on top of us but even when being actively held or petted or cuddled he can’t stay still. Ears as far back as they will go, tail tucked under. He’s just terrified, and nothing I do seems to calm him at all. 

[EDIT to add: we have also tried the plug-in calming hormone diffuser thing and the similar collar, used for several months and never had any apparent effect. Have also tried playing an assortment of “calming music for dogs” stations, etc. I’m telling y’all, there is nothing I won’t try at this point!]

I know it’s time to say goodbye, I’m just trying to find ways to help soothe him in the meantime until our appointment. If anyone has ANY suggestions for sedating meds we haven’t tried or anything that might work?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/xuzz31/senior_dog_with_cognitive_dysfunctiondementia/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Dementia food (Bright Mind) for dog with recurring pancreatitis
 

* **Species: Dog**
* **Age: 13**
* **Sex/Neuter status: Neutered**
* **Breed: Dachshund**
* **Body weight: 13 lbs**
* **History: Pancreatitis**
* **Clinical signs:** 
* **Duration: 3 months**
* **Your general location: Dallas, TX**
* **Links to test results, vet reports, X-rays etc.**  


Hi all - appreciate any advice on this.  


A few months ago our dog had a pretty bad bout of pancreatitis, had to stay overnight at an emergency vet and was in bad shape. They told us that the likelihood of recurrence was pretty high and we needed to monitor her diet closely.   


She had another pancreatitis scare a few weeks ago, it wasn't nearly as bad as the first one though. She did test positive but didn't need to be hospitalized and it was managed by putting her on prescription GI food and gabapentin for awhile.   


However during this last session of vet visits for the pancreatitis, we also realized that she is experiencing signs of doggy dementia. On a day when our vet wasn't available her symptoms were really scaring us (pacing, barking at the walls, etc) and we took her to an emergency vet. They recommended we put her on a food like Bright Mind, but recommended that we call Purina to speak with a nutritionist to ask if Bright Mind is okay for a dog at high risk for pancreatitis. The nutritionist said they wouldn't give us any recommendations unless we had the vet on the line as well. The issue is our vet got really snarky about the recommendations from the emergency vet when we mentioned them to her, and we're not sure which vet to trust because the ER vet seemed very competent.   


So what I'd really like opinions on is whether it's safe to switch our dog to Bright Mind. She is currently still on prescription GI food while we're trying to figure this out, previously she was on Canidae Senior dry kibble.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/z2dycv/dementia_food_bright_mind_for_dog_with_recurring/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"8 y/o dog with early dementia?
Dog

Spayed F

8 y/o this year

Lab Mix 

~40 lbs 

Eats Purina One small bites, takes cosequin and a CBD supplement once daily. Receives bravecto and heart guard for fleas/heartworm prevention


Never had any major medical issues, was spayed as a 5 month old, she has been with me her whole life. She is kept UTD on vaccines and regularly wormed. She is active, not overweight, and is her normal, happy self 75% of the time. 


My dog over the past year has begun exhibiting odd behavior in the afternoon (mostly) and sometimes at night. In the afternoon she will ""sneak"" around the house slowly, just wandering, pacing, and moving slow like she is very nervous. She will also stare at the walls, try to get into the corners. Sometimes she will wake me up at night like she has to go to the bathroom but she will stand at the door and not want to go out. She has also become increasingly grey over the past 1.5 year (she is solid black) I'm not sure if that's relevant. She is terrified of thunderstorms and loud noise, and was taking trazodone for it but I was unhappy because it just kind of knocked her out. She has a thundershirt, I have tried some positive association therapy, it's helped mildly but not much. I'm hoping to try a different medication to manage her anxiety as we live in a southern state and during the summer it will storm just about every afternoon. 




My question is: is she too young to develop cognitive/dementia type symptoms? All the articles I read talk about dogs 10 or older. Should I have her screened for other health issues that could be a root cause while were at the vet? 


I want to be prepared and know what to ask at her upcoming vet appointment. Should I have a CBC run on her since she is getting older and may need a baseline in case she gets sick? I feel like she isn't old enough to be like this and it is upsetting.☹️ Any help on what to ask and/or expect is greatly appreciated.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/v00a7f/8_yo_dog_with_early_dementia/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"How to arrange care for elderly dog w/ dementia while I go on vacation
My 16 yo dachshund is suffering from dementia.  He wakes up and cries, especially at night.  Is occasionally getting ""stuck"" in places he shouldn't, seems to be having more trouble with his house training (he was never perfect), and is much less interested in night-time cuddles.  


All in all, I don't think it's time to let him go yet.  He still responds to food, generally seems to know where he is and where to go, and still responds positively to hugs and kisses (even if he now whines when I try to have him sleep in bed with me).  


My bigger issue is how do I balance his needs with my desire to live my life?  I would really enjoy doing some traveling right now, and Dexter used to go everywhere with me.  But at this point, I don't think subjecting him to the stresses and lack of consistency of travel is best for him.  I'm considering a couple of options -- one is boarding him with the vet, the other is having my niece and nephew tend to his care while I'm gone.  The advantage of the vet is that I know the environment would be completely controlled, but the disadvantage is that the kennel is not familiar to him (the only place he seems to remain calm is his bed in my bedroom).  On the other hand, I worry what it will be like for him without the near 24/7 supervision I can provide.  His schedule is fairly consistent, so I can probably arrange for care the 3-4 times per day day that he usually wakes up, but I'm a bit worried about things at night time.  


I'm really at a loss.  I don't want to hold back on my life for him, but I also feel very committed to giving him optimal care.  Any thoughts would be appreciated",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/sx5no1/how_to_arrange_care_for_elderly_dog_w_dementia/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We thought my dog had a stomach obstruction so we took him to the vet. Turns out he’s fine, he just had an upset stomach because my grandmother (who has dementia) forgot he ate and kept overfeeding him while I was at work. Why is he having trouble pooping?
My dog Reggie (2yo chihuahua mix, neutered male, 14 lb, baby angel, Philadelphia, snuggle expert) vomited 3 times in 1 hour on Monday night, so we brought him to the pet hospital. He was acting lethargic and shaking so we freaked out. We noticed that we saw pieces of his dog food and treats in his throwup, so we figured he probably didn’t get into the trash or anything.

The vet took Reggie to the back to examine him and said he very clearly has an upset stomach and that there are no signs of obstruction. He asked us how often we fed him and we said twice a day half a cup according to the directions on his kibble. He said that can’t be true if he vomited 3 times and asked if somebody else may have fed him. My mom said she left him with my grandmother for a few minutes while she went to get her car cleaned but instructed her not to feed him, just to play with him and most likely take a nap. The vet advised that we check to see if his kibble bag is emptier than it should be, and in the meantime feed him boiled chicken & rice for a week and hold off on treats to see if he feels better.

When we got home we noticed that my grandma had taken his kibble bag into her room and just spilled it on the floor and all of his treat bags were empty!! So it turns out she had WAY overfed him. So we called the vet to confirm his suspicion and went with his treatment plan.

Reggie normally poops twice daily, once after eating in the morning and once after eating in the evening. We all work different hours so he is never alone and goes for walks every 2 hours. Since we started him on chicken and rice (it’s been about 2 days) he has only pooped once. He takes a probiotic with pumpkin twice daily with his food but it doesn’t seem to be helping-I’m wondering if this is normal when dogs are put on this type of diet or if I should be giving him some sort of dog laxative?

"Dog Dementia
Species: Dog
Age: 19 years
Sex: F, Spayed
Weight: 25 pounds
Breed: Some type of mixed herding
History: stroke four years ago, dry eye and losing sight and hearing, incontinence but under control with Proin. Abcessed tooth, can't remove.. too old, meds when needed. Was very active in her youth and will still chase 15 month pup when she feel up to it.
Clinical signs: All night pacing, staring at walls, then walking into them. Walk up to the over 100 pound pup while he is sleeping, and then snap if he moves lean on, if he moves. Can't leave any doors open or she gets stuck everywhere (behind the toilet, dryer, anywhere she can squeeze). She paces all night long, which has progressed more the past two months,, which is the real issue.We are all exhausted.
Location: US, Arizona 

Took her for her annual a couple of months ago; we discussed end of life help. Vet did not think we were there and I agree. She eats, drinks, and potties. She's mobile, etc. The issue of non-stop walking has become the real issue which was not discussed because it has become incredibly increased since the visit. I'm concerned she is going to walk herself to death.

Is there something natural (melatonin?) I can give her to take off the edge and regulate her sleep?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/qqll8m/dog_dementia/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Does Purina Pro Plan Bright Mind lessen the chances of dementia in dogs?
I have read that foods such as Purina Pro Plan Bright Mind (their senior dog line) can treat & prevent dementia in dogs. Is this true? I asked my vet, and she said that some of the dogs that she's had treated with it, have responded, and others haven't, so she wasn't sure what to say. I have read that some studies have shown that dogs on special diets do better on cognitive tests, but when I read that, I wonder if that means that the dogs will be less likely to get dementia, or if they have it, will be more likely to heal from it? Giving Fido brain food so that he can navigate a maze more quickly doesn't necessarily  mean that he won't soil the carpet after years of being housebroken, will it?

Up until now, I have fed both of my dogs (our Jack Russell, as well as a lab mix) different foods, but I am thinking of getting an all life stages food to give both of them. This would keep the Jack Russell's food fresh (she does not plow through a bag of food very quickly, keeping the fat from turning rancid), as well as save me a bit of cash.

But if there would be a likelihood/good possibility of preventing dementia, then by all means it would be worth the cost of the food.

I have been feeding her Purina Pro Plan Bright Mind; if I decide to give the same kibble to both dogs, I would pick from among Purina Pro Plan, Hills Science Diet, or possibly Eukanuba.

"Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and Sleep
I have a 14 year old shih tzu who was diagnosed with canine cognitive decline about 6-8 weeks ago. 

He does not sleep at night. His current medications include:

Morning:
Selegiline 5mg. He gets this in the morning and we’re coming up on two weeks of use. 

Before bed:
Gabapentin 100 mg
Melatonin 5 mg

All of this was prescribed by my vet, who I’ve been working with closely. No matter what we do, my dog will not sleep through the night and it’s impacting everyone in my house, (including my other dog who sees himself as his brother’s protector) He barks, cries, and paces for hours. He will usually sleep from 11 at night to 1 AM and then all bets are off. Once everyone is up and around, he sleeps most of the day. 

I’ve tried white noise and diffusing lavender oil. He has nightlights throughout the house. I’ve tried keeping him awake during the day and getting more activity. It doesn’t make any difference. During the day, when he’s awake, he’s happy and playful and engaged. He doesn’t seem to experience anxiety during the day at all. I’m not even convinced he’s experiencing anxiety at night. He’s just noisy.

"Canine Cognitive Dysfunction?
Wondering if anyone has experience with the following:

7 year old ex-racing greyhound, otherwise healthy. Starting about 6 months ago, she has episodes of “confusion” where she wanders around the house head bobbing and looking around aimlessly. Mostly in the middle of the night but one time during the day. Happens every few weeks but this week it’s been twice. It lasts 10-20 minutes and she seemingly “snaps out of it” and finally responds to her name and settles back into her bed. She has peed and pooped in the house during these as well. 

During the episode she barely recognizes us or her surroundings and it’s a clear transition when she comes back to being herself. 

Discussing with vet next week but has anyone experienced a similar phenomenon?

"Making a pet with canine cognitive dysfunction more comfortable?
Hello, vets! We have a vet appointment this evening, but I wanted to source some additional info here.

My senior Frenchie presumably has a brain tumor (seizures began in April, blood test did not indicate something wrong with liver or kidneys, we elected not to do an MRI b/c anesthesia could be risky and our little guy really hates the vet - he's also 10.75 yrs old). We've been successfully managing his seizures with meds for the last 8 months. Recently, he's begun to exhibit signs of canine cognitive dysfunction (doggy dementia). He is pacing at night a for a few hours, forgetting his house training, becoming less responsive to his name, sometimes stares at nothing or will hand out in a corner facing the wall for a few moments). He does not seem scared and he has not become aggressive. He just a seems a little depressed and confused sometimes. 

He loves kisses, cuddles, his food and treats, his little treat dispensing puzzle game and of course napping on every surface, especially his bed. He's definitely not as happy or active as he was before, but we are trying to be really thoughtful about his quality of life and we believe we bring each other  a lot of joy still. 

I know CCD isn't curable, but what have you all found helpful in making dogs more comfortable? I was thinking of asking the vet about medications like Senilife, but he is already on many medications for the seizures (Keppra, phenobarbital, zonisamide, and sometimes clorazepate if he clusters). Sometimes if he is pacing extra at night, we give him a couple droppers of Medterra CBD oil for dogs. 

Right now, we are just being more patient with him, trying to stimulate his mind with his puzzle games, taking him outside in his stroller when it isn't frigid, and not changing up his environment a lot.

Hi vets, 

Species: dog
Breed: border collie golden retriever mix (best guess) 
Age: approx 13 (she is a rescue)
Spayed/neutered: yes
Weight: 15kg or 33.5 (she has recently lost weight and we have increased her food. She is normally 37-40lbs vets thought it was due to muscle loss. 


My dog in the past year has greatly declined. She is completely deaf and has recently developed cataracts in one eye. Her mobility and back end weakened has slowly gotten worse. These issues have been hard for her but she had still been happy, eating all of her meals, occasionally playing with our other dog, and still enjoying  going on walks to sniff. 

In the past month she has gone from getting up, pacing, and needing to go outside 2-3 times to waking us up every hour to hour and a half. We are currently taking turns sleeping on the couch and letting her outside every hour and generally trying to keep her calm. We are both exhausted. 

We have discussed what has been happening with our vet, but they haven’t suggested any medication or treatment. What I want to to know is whether there is more we can do to help her. She seems really anxious when pacing like she doesn’t know where she is. We also use night lights and try to keep her active during the day. 

She has also recently lost weight and we have increased her food. Would this be related to the pacing or is it something else entirely? 

Sorry for the long post I am just feeling lost and sad for my poor girl.

"Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and QOL
Species: Canine
Breed: Pug
Sex: MN
Age: 15y, 7m
Weight: 7.9 kg
History: MCT x3, brachycephalic airway surgery x2, oronasal fistula surgery 
Comorbidities: Chronic bronchitis, Stage II CKD, pulmonary hypertension, grade III heart murmur, history of TIA (x3)
Medications: Keppra, Benazepril, Plavix, tacrolimus, renal diet 

My pug has been showing more and more signs of cognitive decline over the past six months. He often seems confused and disoriented. He will stand and stare at nothing. He has started urinating in the house (UA was negative for infection). Just this afternoon he peed on the floor four times in less than five hours. He is deaf and largely blind, which could be contributing to this. Even my mother noticed the change when we were visiting for Christmas. 

I have started giving him fish oil and a supplement for cognitive health. I also got him a snuffle mat for enrichment and he really likes it. His neurologist did not think seligiline was appropriate for him. 

My questions are:
1) Are there other things I can do to help slow the progression of the CCD?
2) Do the symptoms of CCD cause him distress or does he even know what’s going on? 
3) Is there a point at which the disease process would affect his QOL so significantly that it would be unethical not to euthanize him?

My dogs in the past were euthanized due to terminal illnesses (post operative sepsis, brain tumor, MDR pneumonia) and it was obvious when it was their time. CCD is much more insidious. This dog is the love of my life and I am afraid that I won’t do what’s best for him because he’s not “sick”. I don’t think we are at that point yet by any means, but I would like to have some objective criteria to help me identify when it is time. Any guidance is greatly appreciated.

Clinical signs: wandering around house, seeming lost, not responding to our calls/her name, slight head tilt, compensating for tilt by leaning to opposite side while walking, sleeping/laying around more during day, soiling house more often w/o asking to be let out

Duration: past two years, gradually

I'm just looking for more info about it. Anything you can tell me. I'm worried this is what I'm dealing with right now. I brought her to an emergency hospital last year because it looked like she had a stroke, staggering around and soiled the house many times. They ruled that out, gave her motion sickness meds and a few weeks. She bounced back and I couldn't be more happy about that. We celebrated her 14th birthday in July, not thinking we would ever. But lately I feel like she's declining. She doesn't seem painful, just out of it. My family and I leave next week for a two week vacation and my grandma is staying over to watch her. I'm hoping to have some insight about CCD, like how to keep her comfortable while we are away. I'm a vet assistant and work at a vet hospital.

I am at a loss. My rescue beagle/doxie (around 11 years old MN) 19lbs, hx of ivdd- that I’ve had for five years has all of a sudden been getting major anxiety when I leave and has torn my blinds and house apart every time I leave. I recently just had blood work done on him and everything looks amazing. The doctor prescribed me Prozac for him and we have been on it for around a month and it’s just not helping. We have tried trazodone as well. He never wants to play with toys or really even go on walks. All he wants to do is be by my side. He hurts himself when he has these episodes and has ripped some of his nails off. He has also been shaking a lot, especially when he thinks I’m about to leave. I feel like such a failure as a dog mom and wish I could do so much more or just stay home all the time. Between me and my boyfriend, we are only gone for at most six hours a day. What else can I do for him? I’m so worried that I might have to put him down and that’s my last resort. I was a vet tech for three years and I am trying to scramble in my mind what else I can do for him, but I’m having trouble. I am so frustrated and scared and worried for him. The vet said that he might have a little bit of dementia and lenticular sclerosis as well. Any advice is appreciated.

"8 year old lab - choroid plexus tumor - SRT or palliative
My 8 year old black lab has had seizures since he was young, but otherwise been very fit/healthy. He loves fetching and swimming and has the best personality. The seizure frequency was rarely more than 1 per month with a short post-ictal phase. His temperament changed last spring, appearing despondent and pacing at times, but otherwise still the dog we always knew and adored. One vet suspected canine cognitive disorder. He was prescribed gabapentin last May. 

He didn’t have a seizure for months, then had two grand Mal seizures in August last year. We took him to a neurologist and were prescribed keppra. Fast forward a few months and he had an episode over Christmas (circling followed by a seizure) and another seizure in January where he let out a cry at the end. Post-ictal phase significantly longer. We took him to the emergency vet and he had an MRI in late January. 

He has approx 1”x1”x1” choroid plexus tumor pressing on his left ventricle and causing CSF accumulation resulting in increased pressure in his skull.

Treatment options -

- Surgery - no possible 

- SRT (3-5 sessions) and recommended VP shunt placed prior to reduce pressure in his skull since radiation will/may cause inflammation resulting in pressure spikes that could be fatal. The shunt will reduce intracranial pressure and reduce the risk of pressure spikes during SRT. 

-palliative: was informed 1-3 months estimated remaining life (1 month ago from neurologist) and 1-4 months survival (2 weeks ago from radiation oncologist). My boy still seems spunky and energetic. Great appetite. 


Need help making a decision. My dog still loves to fetch and go outside every chance he gets. If it wasn’t for the tumor, I would expect him to easily live 4+ more years. It’s hard to not pursue treatment when he’s only 8. It seems SRT has advanced significantly over the last decade, but there aren’t a lot of research journals specific to choroid plexus tumors since they’re less common tumors and I assume many pet parents don’t/can’t pursue treatment.  I want to do what’s best for my dog. Selfishly, I want him around forever, but don’t want to subject him to treatment/therapies if they’re not recommended by those with experience/training who know best. Please help!

"Possible brain tumor
Hi folks,

My 10 year old German Shepherd had a grand mal seizure with vertical nystagmus on Sunday. It was her first ever, so I took her into the emergency vet. 

She has previously shown some symptoms of cognitive decline, but they have been on-and-off and I thought it may have just been an increase in anxiety due to a scare with GVM in June and subsequent surgery. For example, for about a month after her GVM surgery she was urinating in her sleep- but that stopped gradually and she no longer needs diapers. 

Because of the vertical nystagmus and her age, the vet recommended we get an MRI for her and see a veterinary neurologist. This is not financially a problem for us as we have pet insurance for her. 

My question is- if this is indeed a brain tumor, what are the potential risks involved? When I thought she was experiencing cognitive decline/canine dementia I prepared myself to put her down if she continued to get worse. 

My chief concern is with potential behavior changes. Right before her seizure she got really aggressive with another dog (EXTREMELY out of character) and then plopped over and seized. Since she’s so big and still relatively athletic (and FAST) I am scared of her having a major behavior change and potentially becoming violent if this happens again. My SIL has a sweet mini Aussie who comes over often. Should I tell her not to bring him over anymore?  Should I prepare to put her down if it is a brain tumor? Am I overthinking too soon?

**tl;dr:** my dog had a seizure, due to symptoms the vet thinks it may be a brain tumor. I am scared of behavioral changes due to her size. Please advise. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1gprl26/possible_brain_tumor/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"senior dog with gallbladder sludge and decreasing appetite
**Species- dog**

**Age- 17**

Female, spayed

**breed- mini dachshund and chihuahua mix**

Weight- 11.6 lbs

History- hypothyroidism (diagnosed when puppy, on saloxine most of life- managed at correct dose and recent levels checked and normal)

suspected myoclonic and possible absence seizures (started about 4 years ago, reason unknown- no MRI done d/t age, managed with keppra every 8 hours)

arthritis- on carprofen every morning (has been on for a couple years) possible Cushing’s- treatment not recommended due d/t being asymptomatic

Grade 2 systolic murmur

Likely canine cognitive dysfunction- recent onset of urinary incontinence at night, occasionally walks in circles, gets stuck between things, etc.

Clinical signs- 

Back in August, she started vomiting bile in the morning. She had done this before every few weeks or so..but then it became more frequent and nearly every morning. She was started on Pepcid 5g a day for acid reflux. At that time, she had some labs and her BUN was elevated and the vet said she’s probably got early kidney disease and it wouldn’t be a bad idea to switch her to a renal diet. I picked up hills science diet kidney care and started to transition her very slowly but she didn’t do super well with it. She’d been on eukanuba senior dog petite race for the past 10 years or so. I ended up feeding her about 3/4 eukanuba and the kidney care just 1/4. The vomiting stopped but slowly she started losing interest in food and would spit out her kibble. She’s always been very food motivated so this was unusual. I’d add in a little boiled chicken and rice and eventually that wasn’t helping either.

About a week ago she started drinking more water and I dropped off a urine sample- besides being  a bit dilute (not new for her- past year or so) it didn’t show a UTI. This was also around the time she started having accidents in the bed. One morning she woke me up at 530, vomited, and was shaking and had been incontinent of urine. She wouldn’t eat or drink and was shaking. Took her to the emergency vet where they did labs which showed she was slightly anemic (new for her, RBC 4.67, Hct 30.4, Hgb 10.5), plateletcrit 0.51. ALT was barely high at 126, ALP now >2000 which is quite the jump for her, cholesterol 337.   I did notice last year her triglyceride was 1,125 (says range is 20-150??) Nobody ever said anything about it and it wasn’t drawn again. Creatinine was 1.5.

The emergency vet sent us home with Cerenia for nausea which seemed to help but now the vet said she can only have it every other day. She had an abdominal ultrasound later that week to rule out any major issues. I truly thought I was losing her. 

The ultrasound showed gallbladder sludge and some kidney stones on the left.

My concern is the gallbladder sludge. My vet has said nothing about it really and from what I read that can be very serious. As far as her diet, she won’t eat any kibble anymore and I’ve been trying to do low fat/lean ground meats and veggies but she’s pretty picky.  I don’t see how that’s sustainable or adequate long term and again, my vet doesn’t seem concerned with treating the sludge or with what I’m feeding her which concerns me.

I understand she is 17.. but if the nausea is being caused by the sludge in her gallbladder..why aren’t we treating it? Also, could the kidney diet have set this off because of the high fats? What should I be feeding her now? Thoughts on Urosidol and long term use of Cerenia (every other day)

"Second Opinion Request

Not an emergency. 

Vet only, please. 

~15.5 y.o. Spayed “Shepherd Terrier” mix
Location: Central Florida, USA

Activity: 0.84-mile slow walk 5-6 days a week before the sun comes up, then walks around the house for an hour before breakfast, then sleeps all day getting up a few times here and there, then gets up and walks around for an hour before dinner, walks around after dinner, plays, then bed. She was diagnosed as having “canine Alzheimers” since she is constantly getting stuck in corners and tight spaces. 

Food: BJs Premium and Supreme Raw blend complete meal for two years until 7/2024 (she got tired of eating it) when we switched to FreshPet cooked chicken complete meal with raw sardines. 

Supplements: soil-based probiotics, rejensa joint chews (modified glucosamine, from the vet), Dr. Bill’s Canine Cognitive Support, kelp (150mcg iodine per day), and turmeric golden paste

Medications: Heartgard plus heartworm preventive

I have been giving her CBD from good companies with 3rd party testing since ~2016. 2016-2022 was CBD isolate and the last two years have been giving broad spectrum CBD. The routine labs always came back with “slightly high liver” which never concerned the two vets I was seeing before we moved in 2021. We’ve been going to a different vet since 2021 when we relocated across the US. 

April 2024: routine annual exam, labs were all normal and I agreed to several vaccines reluctantly, aside from the mandatory rabies vaccine. 

I Increased CBD dosage to about 34mg/2x day because I thought she would benefit as she was getting slower I think. I can’t remember but I had a good reason for it. 

August 2024: noticed a hanging growth under her tongue (video above). Went to our vet on 8/5 who recommended surgery to remove it in case it’s a malignant tumor that’s missing pigment, I forgot the medical term. We stopped all supplements including the CBD in preparation for the surgery. 

8/7/2024 night: She threw up her breakfast a couple of hours after giving a piece of banana. We didn’t fast her since it was 12 hours since eating breakfast and gave her dinner not long after. After dinner, she got 1/2 of an Oravet dental chew but seemingly chewed in two halves before swallowing. 

She threw up several more times into the following morning which included her undigested meal and both halves of the Oravet chew. We fasted her for 16 hours occasionally giving only coconut water (no sugar added)  until we finally decided to feed her due to her lethargy. Fed a little pureed boiled chicken breast and white rice every few hours. We noticed she had a fever that crept up to 104.7 overnight Friday 8/9 into Saturday so we applied a cold compress to her feet and ears, while she wore her cooling vest. We brought the fever down to 103.5 during the night and 102.4 right before going to the vet. 

When we went to the vet the following morning (Saturday 8/10), we told the vet everything including the fact that she was now eating. He recommended postponing the surgery. We requested labs that showed ALT 16x higher than in April and slightly low WBC. Pictures of the last two sets of labs above - April labs were sent out, and August labs were done in-house. She also lost two lbs since April because of the vomiting?

The vet prescribed Enrofloxacin 204mg flex tabs  - 1/2 tablet twice daily for ten days and a supplement for her liver called Denamarin 225 mg S-Adenosylmethionine* and 82 mg Silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (SPC)' (SAMe) two tablets daily on an empty stomach one-hour minimum before food. 

Her temperature was 102.6 at the the vet and it's now 101.6 after two doses of antibiotics. She is showing signs of improvement when she’s awake however she is still tired and is sleeping a lot today, only a little more than she usually does. I can see her face is still tired. 

Also, it’s probably worth mentioning that she had an emergency stomach exploratory surgery two years ago because she ate a sanitary pad. She recovered well and she has not eaten anything foreign since then. 


My wife suggested we don’t do the surgery at all since it’s taking her quite some time to bounce back and we don’t know how the anesthesia will affect her considering her age.  We believe he cares about his patients even though he doesn’t seem to absorb all the details we tell him until we reiterate it. We just want additional opinion(s) on the overall situation including the kidney and surgery. 

Thank you for your time.

  I noticed my dogs waist looked a bit odd and I'm not sure if it's cause for concern or if it's just been so long since she's been a healthier weight (we had a problem getting her to lose weight for the last few years and our vet had her trial some thyroid medicine which greatly helped). She has previously had and treated heartworms (roughly 10 years ago-found shortly after we adopted her). I have noticed over the years her chest seems to have gotten more barrel shaped and our vet hasn't seemed very concerned about it. I know some of it is that she's ""poofier"" there and her rear end is shorter hair but the undercoat is very dense. She doesn't seem to be acting very abnormal aside from general elderly dog issues with hearing, vision, and cognition which all of those are intermittent (the hearing could also be her ignoring us, we are painfully familiar with the Husky ways...). I can't think of any reason why her waist would be abnormal. I'm not sure if it's just that its healthy but looks odd compared to her upper body?

"13 year old extra large breed dog having good days and bad. Struggling to determine when we’re “a week early” rather than “a day late” to euthanasia. 
I have a 13-year-old Newfoundland/German Shepherd mix. He is a sweet, gentle giant and we are honoured to be his family. 

He has had various health issues since we adopted him at age 7. Despite receiving treatment for arthritis, tie back surgery for laryngeal paralysis/GOLPP, canine cognitive dysfunction, removal of a malignant tumour on his lip, and other ailments, he’s been struggling more recently. He finds it hard to stand and use stairs at times, and gets tired quickly on short walks. He also has spells of confusion and distress at night, panting and pacing for hours, and pants frequently during the day.

We’ve tried medications like metacam, gabapentin, and glucosamine, which he still takes daily, but with debatable improvement. He loves winter due to his thick coat but REALLY struggles in the summer, even with every cooling tip we have tried. Our vet attributes this temperature management issue to laryngeal paralysis.

As warmer weather approaches, I’m really concerned about his comfort. Would it be kinder to consider letting him go before summer, sparing him potential discomfort, or should we wait and see if he can make it to enjoy another winter? I want to honor his life without causing unnecessary suffering, but I’m torn about making this decision too early since he is still eating, drinking, still finds some joy in a short walk and a cuddle on the couch, and still has control over his bowels/bladder. Seeking perspectives before my next vet visit and greatly appreciate any advice. ❤️🐾",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1cd5lak/13_year_old_extra_large_breed_dog_having_good/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I'm not a vet, but here are my 2 cents. Your concern is quality of life, and only you, your dog, and your vet can determine at what point it is better to say goodbye. But here are some questions to ask: 


Is your dog in pain or discomfort? If so, how bad is it and is it manageable? 


How much stress (physical and / or emotional) is your dog experiencing? How often is your dog under that stress? 


Is your dog happy? Does he show signs of interest, satisfaction, and joy? If so, how often does your dog show signs of happiness?


And most importantly ask your vet what the likely outcomes would be if nature took its course. Will your dogs conditions worsen over time? If so, what would be the worsening symptoms and what kind of timeline does that typically follow? 


Best wishes to you, your family, and your old pup.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1cd5lak/13_year_old_extra_large_breed_dog_having_good/#l27nw4l,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don’t know what to make of our 9 year old beagle’s actions the last couple weeks
We got our beagle about 7 years ago (actually 7 years ago next week I think). He’s always been a little neurotic and anal. But recently, he’s been barking much more, particularly when we’re eating a meal together. He isn’t very smart but this was relatively unlike him. He’s also had less enthusiasm to jump on things, which isn’t unexpected, he’s taken arthritis medication for pain before.

The thing that seems concerning the last few days though, is he seems to be getting stuck on things. He thought he was stuck on the bit of carpet before our tile floor and wouldn’t go, or he walked up one stair and then got stuck and whine and cried for 10 minutes until he finally got himself down. I don’t think this is causing him pain, but he gets distressed and pants a lot when this happens. 

His back half also looks a lot more haggard than normal, like his fur looks unkempt and falling off at the touch, no bare spots but it’s definitely noticeable from several feet away.

I’ve read about canine cognitive issues and canine dementia, just not sure what to think or do next. 

As I was typing this, he jumped on the couch and laid down, so he’s still mobile enough.

"Adult dog, surgical removal of two independent masses. Pathology report shows Grade 1 soft tissue sarcoma.
Species: Canine

Age: 7 years, 7 months

Sex/neuter status: female/spayed

Breed: Treeing Walker Coonhound/Lab? Mix

Body weight: 63 lbs 8oz

History: noticed two separate masses May 2022; one on upper left leg (hard and immovable) and one on left flank between rib cage and hindquarter (soft and similar to lipoma in feel). 

Clinical signs: two masses, no other behavioral, emotional, or cognitive changes noticeable

Duration: 
May 2022: noticed two very small masses
June 2022: FNA of both lumps came back clean-told to watch for any changes in lumps
July 2023: annual wellness visit and exam; FNA came back indicating possible sarcoma in one, but not the other. Masses had grown in size x2-4 since one year prior and opted to remove. 
Sept 2023: excision of both masses, dirty margins due to locations: pathology report indicates both masses are Grade 1 soft tissue sarcoma with incomplete margins. 

General location: Philadelphia area

Due to the locations, cleaner margins are not possible without removing vital muscle tissue. Removing it would make for a difficult recovery and possibly leave her with mobility issues. 

We have an appointment with a radiologist and oncologist on Tuesday for consultation. I want to keep her quality of life at the top of our priority list and give us more time with her if possible. 

I am wondering what the likelihood of these lumps being independent of one another is. I cannot find any data or cases in the existing literature on canine STS where two masses of the same type have been removed at the same time. Is it likely one is a met of the other? 

Does anyone know if there is data available to give me an idea on outcomes for dogs with two masses with dirty margins opting for radiation and/or chemo?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16jsvlx/adult_dog_surgical_removal_of_two_independent/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I'm going to assume you mean ""upper left HIND leg"" and in that case, there could be a metastatic relationship where the leg mass split and started the flank mass. This is not, to my knowledge, a tumor type that spontaneously starts in independent locations. It doesn't change the situation whether it's a met or not though. In terms of outcomes, STS is a more unpleasant cancer. Dirty margins means the cancer is still there, so we're now on a clock to maintain quality of life for as long as possible. Median survival times (MST) vary broadly for this cancer! I was surprised to see the range and duration: the overall MST I find is between 1 and 7 years - yes, _years_. There have got to be more factors than fit in this GP's brain, so the one who's going to get you the most relevant prognosis is your new oncologist.

"What next?
Species: Canine
Age: 12 1/2
Neutered Male
Breed: Bichon Frise
Weight: 11ish pounds
History: mild urinary issues/crystals- managed with diet, history of separation anxiety
Clinical signs: pacing, panting, whining, occasional barking, inappropriate urination/defecation, obsessive licking/digging 
Duration: about 2 years of anxiety, recently diagnosed with Canine Cognitive Disorder (less than 2 months ago)
General location: southeastern USA
No available test results but all bloodwork (senior labwork done every 6 months is all perfect)

I am posting here because I am truly at my wits end with my spouses dog. If it weren't for me, this poor dog wouldn't even be on anxiety medicine as my partner didn't realize the signs. 

The dog in question has always had pretty severe separation anxiety. My spouse has had the dog since he was a puppy. My spouse completed no training with the dog, and dog didn't even know how to ""sit"" until I taught him about 3 years ago now. 

Dog was put on fluoxetine roughly 2 years ago. We saw a massive improvement in obsessive licking/pacing/following everywhere. Meds worked well for the last 2 years. However recently he began pacing, waking in the middle of the night, getting stuck, staring at walls, having ""accidents"" inside...all the markers for CCD. So we are tapering him off the fluoxetine, have him on trazodone/gabapentin and galiprant for suspected arthritis pain. And are going to put him on anipryl when the fluoxetine is 100% out of his system.

HOWEVER: it is SO apparent that his symptoms are much worse than we ever realized. Tapering him off the fluoxetine has either exacerbated or created new symptoms. He is now panting like he went on a 10 mile run even when he has not exercised. He is now whining (super strained high pitched) whining even when he is in the same room as us. He is trying to ""dig"" out of his crate when we resort to the crate for a moment of silence. He will *not* settle down. The trazodone and gabapentin seem to be doing literally nothing for him. The whining goes on ALL night. 

We have 2 1/2 more weeks before we can start the anipryl. 

At what point is this disease too far gone to be treated? Everything I'm reading says basically the same thing- it's a tough diagnosis and to try to keep him on schedules/routines. But the reality is, nothing is helping. At what point is euthanasia the answer for a dog whose normal state is high heart rate, panting, and desperately uncomfortable? At what point is it OK to say, no one is happy anymore and keeping this poor dog alive may actually just be cruel...when he is otherwise healthy?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/184r5ig/what_next/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I'm sorry you're going through this. CCD is extremely hard for people because dogs often eat, drink, and do everything else ""normal"" enough, but they just aren't *there* anymore. 

At some point, you'll likely end up needing to heavily sedate him to get any peace and quiet. And it's hard to hear it, but it's OK to let him go before this point. 

It's ALWAYS better to let them go a day too early than a day too late.  In cases like this I say give them a fabulous day or a few days and plan on a quiet home euthanasia (if it's something you can financially afford) or a quiet planned euthanasia at a trusted vet clinic. Give them some fantastic snacks, chocolate, burgers, whatever makes them happy just before and let them go happily and quietly in the arms of their loved ones. It is ALWAYS ok for you to say you can't handle it physically or mentally anymore and say good bye when their brains are no longer functioning properly.

"Vet Told Me My Health 3 Year Old Cat Will Need All of Her Teeth Pulled
**TLDR**: My cat went in for a dental cleaning, and six teeth were pulled. She’s healthy, her bloodwork is perfect, and she has no preexisting conditions. The vet told me she would have all of her teeth pulled eventually because of an “overactive immune system” with no additional explanation. This is my first cat, and I need to know what the next steps are.

My cat is almost three years old, a domestic shorthair, and has never had any chronic health issues. She stays inside full time, is up to date on all vaccines, has annual exams and preventative blood work, is negative for FEL-V/DIV/heartworms, eats grain-free food (PURINA ONE Indoor Advantage), we use Revolution for heartworm/flea/tick, and she eats a few Greenies most days. The only health issue she’s had was an injection site reaction, which resolved without any surgical intervention.

I wanted to get her teeth cleaned last year, and the vet told me it would be overkill because she didn’t have any plaque or tartar, and her bloodwork was perfect. I took her in for her annual exam a few weeks ago and told the vet that her breath was starting to smell and that I’d like to have her teeth cleaned before it became an issue. When we went over the estimate, there was a section noting extractions, and the vet told me the odds of her needing anything extracted were extremely low because she was showing no signs of issues with her teeth or gums.

I scheduled the appointment and took her in on Thursday. I got a call from the surgeon a few hours later, and they told me she needed to extract 6 teeth, and I needed to decide immediately because she was under anesthesia. I asked if there were any other options (my mind was blown by the idea of her having that many teeth removed and not having time to think it through), and she said, “Steroids, but you can’t do it long term. It’s a bacterial infection.” When I asked what would cause this, she told me that while my cat had very little plaque or tartar, her gums were inflamed (the opposite of what I’d been told a few weeks ago), and she would eventually need to have all of her teeth pulled. 

I decided to let them pull the six teeth because I felt like I was under the gun, and I didn’t want her to be in pain or sick. When I went to pick her up, I asked to speak with someone about what was going on with her teeth that would have caused this, and the surgeon came out and was … caustic. They refused to tell me anything beyond that my cat will eventually be toothless, and I’ll need to get her teeth cleaned twice a year or more, and I should expect to pay for extractions every time. 

I asked what was going on with a bacterial infection and if she needed antibiotics. She said no. She also told me that wet food was optional (she usually eats kibble), which felt odd to me when she’d had 6 teeth pulled, but I don’t know anything about feline dental care, so I accepted it. FWIW, I did put her on wet food.

I took her home, and we’ve been on a strict schedule with Onsior (3 days), gabapentin (2x/day), and now Enulose (2x/day). She’s been able to use her litter box and is starting to behave like her normal self again (making biscuits, jumping on furniture, etc). She is eating (I don't know how to compare the wet food consumption to her usual kibble, but she seems ok) and just started drinking water again last night.

I understand that I’m probably coming off like an insane pet owner right now. I’m in STEM, so everything is quantifiable to me (lol). I played the recording of the surgeon to my friend, who’s worked in vet clinics for decades, and she told me the entire interaction felt off and I should get a second opinion ASAP. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but the clinic she went to is one of many under the same umbrella company (VetSavers). I spoke with a friend about it, and she told me her cat has this issue, and it’s called stomatitis. 

My real question is what my next steps should be. I scheduled an appointment with a different vet for a second opinion, signed up for pet insurance (Embrace), and looked into stomatitis. I have no idea what I’m doing here, and the amount of information out there about “this cured my cat” is too vast for me to sift through. I’m not a “let’s start this supplement!” without consulting with a vet, and I’m skeptical about anything that hasn’t been proven scientifically. Notably, I'm a grad student, and my budget is limited, but if I have enough time to plan for it, I can make it work.

Any advice or ideas would be appreciated. If you’ve made it through this long of a post, thank you :).",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1bzcohj/vet_told_me_my_health_3_year_old_cat_will_need/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"In addition to the comments on stomatitis, I'd also like to add that cats do this weird thing where they resorb their teeth from root to crown. It's called a FORL and you can't tell it's happening until the root is completely gone and the tooth is mobile or until you get dental radiographs.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1bzcohj/vet_told_me_my_health_3_year_old_cat_will_need/#kypai27,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Vet, but not your vet. The most likely condition requiring full mouth extractions is gingivostomatitis. It is typically caused by an over-reaction of the immune system to plaque, but may be related to viruses too. The teeth frequently have very little evidence of plaque, but even tiny amounts create a big reaction. Regardless of the cause, it can be incredibly painful. Even through the pain, cats will keep eating because it is part of their instinct to survive and hide pain. Most people have no idea how much pain their cat is in until the extractions are done and the mouth heals. A lot of them will act like kittens again. 

Another common cat mouth disease are resorptive lesions. They can occur with or without stomatitis, but we don’t typically jump to full mouth extractions with this condition like we do with stomatitis. 

The best way to manage gingivostomatitis is through full mouth extractions. Sometimes this is literally all the teeth. Sometimes this is just the teeth behind the canine teeth. It really depends on how affected the mouth is.  I have only had 1 cat in my career that didn’t respond really well to extractions, and it was the most severe case both myself and the veterinary dentist had ever seen. The disease can be sometimes managed with steroids, but it is not ideal and can significantly increase the risk of other diseases like diabetes. 

I promise you, no vet is recommending full extractions from a cat’s mouth without major disease being present. It is not easy work. It is exhausting and delicate, and requires significant time. This is not something we look forward to doing, and definitely not something we would recommend just to make money. 

Get your second opinion, ideally with a veterinary dentist, and if the diagnosis is the same, do the extractions. Your cat will be able to eat just fine even with no teeth, and they will be so much happier. ",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1bzcohj/vet_told_me_my_health_3_year_old_cat_will_need/#kypm0pn,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Did your vet talk about stomatitis specifically? I see they mentioned the gums being inflamed, which is gingivitis, but this doesn't mean all of the teeth need extracted. In the case of stomatitis, which would align with the immune system comments made too, full tooth extraction is often the only curative measure. You can try to medically manage stomatitis, but it is often unsuccessful. Full mouth extractions are often curative for stomatitis. If things weren't explained thoroughly by your vet and you left feeling like you had a bunch of questions, I would seek a second opinion and find a vet who will explain things in a way that works for you and makes sense!  This sounds like a case of miscommunication and the vet probably not explaining things well enough.

Cats do better on wet food regardless of how many teeth they have, but a cat usually can still eat dry food when they're missing teeth too :)",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1bzcohj/vet_told_me_my_health_3_year_old_cat_will_need/#kyox96e,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I don't think you're an insane pet owner. It sounds like there has been poor communication and mixed messages.


If stomatitis, full-mouth extraction is the gold star treatment.


As for whether or not it's actually stomatitis, getting an appointment for a second opinion is your first step, so great that you've already done it. I'd recomment a cat-specific clinic or dental specialist if available; the actual surgery would be much more expensive via the latter route, but at least they could assess and definitively confirm or deny the diagnosis.

Not trying to he a debbie downer, just trying to give you a realistic perspective on what to expect.

If you hadn't gotten the other teeth extracted already, there *may* have been an unethical pro life tip in there about how to commit a **teeny tiny itty bitty bit of insurance fraud**, but I would *never* condone such a thing.

,"Unfortunately not a lot is known about stomatitis in cats. The only current treatment is tooth extraction. Depending on the severity of the case, only a partial extraction is needed.

Extraction can sometimes 100% clear it up. If not, it still vastly improves the oral health of the cat. After teeth extraction, cats can still eat kibble after the being period. They also will be able to do everything like they did before.

,"They do make a basepaws DNA test for dental health in cats. It can show the risk of dental disease developing. 

Stomatitis gold star treatment is a cleaning and seal of teeth every 6 months to a year. If this is cost prohibitive, or you do not want your cat under anesthesia, full mouth extractions are done. Also the best option when it extends caudal in the oral cavity. 

Bad teeth genetics cause oral resorptive lesions. Best route is dental xrays and cleanings every year, or when one is seen. The lesions appear at the gumline and are painful for the cat. It is an exposed nerve. Not all get to this point and it is only seen on xray. 

A dental specialist is a great idea. This is all they do, and most do a head CT at the same time. They also work with anesthesiologist.

,"No. Cavaliers and Poodles are both known for several health problems. Breeding dogs is always a bit of a gamble since, as humans, we cannot control every variable. But full health testing can stack the odds in your favor. Ideally the testing should be done both on the parents and on the earlier relatives since genetic health issues can and do pop up generations down the pedigree. 

These tests need to be done before any litters are produced, not after. A backyard breeder and puppy mill producer might promise you it will be done but once you hand your money over, there isn’t much you can do. In the event your puppy does develop a cardiac, thyroid or hip issue, would you be willing to give it up once you have it? That’s assuming the breeder is willing to take it back.

Our clinic regularly sees lost and abandoned supermutts, including cavapoos. They are the popular new designer mix and unsold litters are dumped semi-regularly. Health testing your breeding stock before breeding is a basic requirement for any half decent breeder. I’d recommend either finding one who does test, or, if you don’t mind untested, searching the shelters for a pup who needs a home. 

Regardless, If you decide to go with this breeder or a shelter puppy, I’d recommend looking into pet insurance so you are in the best place possible should any issues develop.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1iquedy/should_i_buy_a_cavapoo_puppy_from_a_breeder_who/#md35n69,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Vet won’t release full health record to me
I messaged our vet and asked that our dog’s full medical records be sent to my email. They said they don’t release full records to clients, but we could get a vaccination history or billing statement. They said they will send the full records to another vet, but I want to look at them myself.

Okay so where do I start, our cat lily she is 5 months, we adopted her from the animal shelter she was my baby at first sight she isn't particularly fond of my wife for some reason but with me she'll come lay on me and love on me 24/7, she is for the most part pretty laid back until she gets the zoomies and she starts ripping at the curtains and all that lol. But yesterday my wife texts me while I'm at work saying that lily had peed in a pile of our clothes my wife washes the clothes and lily avoids her for the rest of the day. But last night comes and I'm playing my steam deck and lily comes up to me wanting to be pet and apparently I wasn't fast enough to giving her a pet and she squat in our bed and peed she then ran off and avoided us again until about 3 in the morning when she decided it's time For us to get up. But fast forward to this morning while I'm on the road I get another text from my wife saying she's about to run to town to get cat litter, and so while she's getting ready apparently lily came up and peed in her clothes she laid out to go to town. I have no clue what to do all I can think of is that we moved her litter box to another room and she's lashing out. But she is my first cat l've owned and I'm not sure how cats really operate.

After medical reasons are ruled out, look up what a litter trial is. In a nutshell, you get a bunch of boxes and a different type of litter for each one.

Also avoid scented litters.

I only found out earlier this friday that my cat Dibo is having a hard time peeing, I took him to the vet the same day after I collected some funds for him to be cathetered. But the vet here rejected us because we lack a couple hundreds more. So I took him to the city vet, and they've given him anti biotics and anti inflammatory.


Next day, we were able to complete the money needed but turns out they can't catherter him anymore bcs his urinary track is already blocked, and requires an xray and ultrasound. Sadly, we couldn't bring him to the vet anymore due to lack of funds :(((


Now he's been vomitting yellow substance with worms in them, and he never eats anymore, he just drinks water.

"Please help - we picked up our constipated cat from the vet, covered in her feces and drastic health decline after only 24 hours. Hours later she was critical. What could have happened? Why wasn’t she checked on during her stay? 
Apologies in advance as this situation has been very confusing and I’d like to know how something like this could have happened. How could our primary vet have let this happen?

Background: 10 year old cat, female, overweight (average 22lbs - by last night she was down to 18lbs), overall a very chill and happy cat, only previous health issue was a UTI years ago. 

September 15:
My cat started scooting more than usual, we’re talking tons of scoot marks everywhere. No other symptoms, perfectly normal otherwise. 

September 18: 
Appointment with online vet advising she was likely constipated and to put a small amount of MiraLax in food for her. She had no reaction to the MiraLax and we kept a closer eye on her box (we have a second cat and it’s hard to know who’s is who’s). We gave her a pinch extra one night since she was overweight, caused her to have a slight diarrhea moment. This is the only time she had diarrhea. 

September 25: 
(One day after the diarrhea incident). Took her to an in person vet, as the poop situation was not getting any better. Vet felt her for constipation and said it could not be that. They took her blood and found extremely high liver enzymes (~600). Prescribed Denamarin once a day for 30 days. Following this, we were able to get Denamarin in her three nights before she got too smart and spit it out.

September 28: 
Started to slowly jaundice. Has less and less of an appetite. Called vet for next available appointment. 

October 1:
Went back to vet, liver enzymes slightly lowered but she was becoming more lethargic. Vet could not decipher what was wrong and decided to Xray. Found that she was in fact extremely constipated, just as we had thought over a week prior. Vet recommended she stay overnight for two nights while they give her an enema or two and fluids. We left her there with the understanding that they would solve the cosntipation within the next day or so and would be no issue. 

October 2:
8AM: call from vet saying she had started to pass some of the poop, doing great but still has more to go.
10AM: they noticed her IV had come out. 
7PM: call from vet saying that just checked on her for the first time since 10 and she was cold, her temperature had dropped to 96°. They recommended that we take her to an emergency 24 hour clinic so she can be watched over night as they had no one to stay where she was currently. 
8PM: we arrive at vet to pick her up and transport to the next clinic. they take us back and she’s in a kennel, dazed, completely covered in feces, and limp. 
9PM: arrive at emergency clinic. she was extremely lathargic, hardly moving at all in the carrier while we waited. got into the room and let her out of the carrier and she just laid there with her head down, occasionally looking around. 
11:30PM: still waiting for the vet to see her, her breathing was alarmingly slow and short. grabbed a tech to check her out and they took her back. 
12AM: vet told us she was extremely concerned and wasn’t sure what was going on but would run tests to see what they showed compared to the results the night before. 
1AM: more testing showed no signs of anything getting worse or better. physically becoming worse though. considered in critical condition. 
1:30AM: feces and blood coming out of her at this point and 100% dazed, no lifting of the head whatsoever. vet recommended euthanasia as it was unlikely they could decipher what was happening to her before she passed on her own. 
2AM: they brought her in the room wrapped in a blanket on a table. she barely moved her eyes and just let us love her in her last moments. peacefully euthanized. 

The emergency clinic was wonderful - she came to them in terrible condition. What we are extremely concerned with is the fact that we took her to the regular clinic  and she was not well, but certainly okay. When picking her up 24 hours later she was knocking on deaths door, undisclosed to us before we saw her ourselves, COMPLETELY covered in her feces. I will never forget the sight of her in that kennel looking so sick and sad. I understand the enema will cause her to go, but I can’t understand what happened in those 24 hours that basically killed her. We are heartbroken over the loss of her. The only peace we have is that we were able to be with her when she passed and was not left to die in the feces and drool filled kennel she had been in.

,Not a vet. Someone had a similar issue occur at my local vet. They put in a board complaint with all the details. They investigated 9 complaints at least 2 of them featured a pet with a sudden decline over what was expected to be a routine stay. Wasnt so much that the pets died but that they werent being checked up on and handed back to the owner on deaths door with no explanation. A papertrail over the treatment of the pets was either missing or partially fabricated after the dogs died. They ultimately stopped the vet from practicing anymore. ,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1fvme9j/please_help_we_picked_up_our_constipated_cat_from/#lqcqpfh,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Are the health issues in Cavalier King Charles significant enough to recommend avoiding the breed?
My mom was severely traumatized by the death of her dog two years ago, and she’s finally considering getting another dog in the near future. Cavalier King Charles are at the top of her list, however she’s concerned about longevity and the health issues associated with the breed. My parents would purchase from a high-end breeder, and they have enough money/resources to take excellent care of their pets. Do you recommend avoiding this breed?

The Cavs I see typically live to about 11-12yo but will all be on expensive heart meds and regular vet visits for the last 2-3 years of their lives.

,"I used to recommend against them, but nowadays advocate more for informed decision making and pet insurance.

A few stats for you, as I remember them right now:

50% of CKC will have a heart murmur by the age of 5, 90% by the age of 10.

60% of heart murmurs will never amount to any actual heart disease, but 40% will.

Of those with heart disease, the sooner you catch it and start treating and monitoring appropriately, the better.

Of those with mitral valve disease, 13% will go into heart failure, usually within 2-5 years of diagnosis. 

Even in the 87% not in heart failure, heart disease will complicate and dictate their lives and health, as other procedures such as necessary dentals etc might be avoided due to the heart risks. This should not be a factor.
If you willingly get a CKC, you need to embrace the expenses and risks that come with the breed, and committ to best care.

If you get a CKC, heart disease will be on your mind and quite likely in your future, so you need to be ready and willing and able to do what's necessary.

An expensive breeder isn't necessarily good. I'm not sure how you'd vet them or be able to trust what they're saying, but they'd need to be VERY transparent and informed, and on the ball with screening their breeding dogs and following up with puppies, removing dogs with murmurs from their breeding stock, informing owners etc.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1fq6u7u/are_the_health_issues_in_cavalier_king_charles/#lp3rkuo,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cat causing a health problem.
Hi everyone, hope im in the right subreddit, I have two cats that are currently outside, they were inside as kittens, my dad couldn't handle them at the time and they were eager to go outside, so we made in a old chicken coop ( just a clean room in our shead, no chickens ofc) into a cat house, they have heating, few cat beds, litter box, toys etc, everything that a cat needs, I lock them at night so they are safe, there are foxes here, they come at night so feel they are safe being locked up at night, and once the sun is up all day they have a whole yard and neighborhood to explore. Now to get to the point, my dad no longer lives here I do with my husband and I take care of them, I want them to be more inside the house they get along nicely with our dog and we love them a lot, but my husband is getting an allergic reaction every time they come inside, he gets a rash on top of that I got a fungi infection on my head from them we cuddle a lot and I know one of them brushed their head on to mine few times ( I'm being treated for that now ) Cats seem to be healthy, no missing fur, they get vet approved medicine preventing them getting parasites and fleas etc. Is there anything that I can do so we can have the cats inside more often?

"Losing it over my cats health issues... Looking for second opinions and advice.
My 8 year old soul cat is having urinary issues. He is a male. A few months ago they found blood in his urine and diagnosed w A UTI. Took antibiotics. On urinary diet. He was acting mostly fine until yesterday, all urinary blockage symptoms. Went to ER.

He had a stone stuck in his urethra and 2 in his bladder. Also apparantly has kidney stones. They used a catheter and the one in his urethra I guess disappeared? They said it likely dissolved or got pushed back into the bladder and they can't see it. 

Vet says it wouldn't be wrong to do a cystotomy for the other one in the bladder but could also suggest monitoring him to see if it passes or dissolves like the other one. 

i'm so  so lost. he is my only family and I want to do right by him. obviously I'd prefer to avoid a surgery like that but I also don't want to try to be conservative and have something happen.

As vets, what would you guys recommend or do in a case like this? I really don't want to make the wrong choice. but i'm terrified of surgical complications, monitoring recovery, reblockages, etc. he's gone all his life without issues and i'm heartbroken that he's being monitored at an ER and suffering.

"My pets' previous owner wants to visit them. What will this do to their mental health?
About a year ago, I adopted a bonded cat dog pair. They actually didn't take very long to adjust to me and they have been an immense blessing in my life ever since. Each day, they show me that they are happy and love their lives.

Not long after I got them, I started an Instagram page and I post on it a few times a week. It was through this page that I connected with the owner who had given them up for adoption. She and her family had fallen on hard times and had no choice. She was so extremely grateful to see that they were in good hands and every single time I post a picture, she and her husband like it.

Today is 13 months since the adoption day. It's probably about a year and a 1/2 since she gave them up. I received a message from her on Instagram asking if she and her husband could come visit the pets. I think she also intends to bring her children, who are probably about 5 and 8 by my estimation.

 There are many different considerations here, but for purposes of this post, I am asking a simple question:  *What impact will this have on the mental health of my pets?* Will it be distressing and confusing for them to see their old owners?  Once the owners leave, will they just forget about the visit or will it linger in their minds such that an old wound is reopened? 

Please let me know if I can provide any further information. I have lots of other things to think about before I make a decision, but it will be helpful to understand how it will impact the mental health of my pets. Thank you so much for your time.

UPDATE

For anyone who is interested, I shared the many concerns that were going through my head with the previous owner. She ultimately agreed with me and decided it was best not to reopen old wounds. I hope I didn't make her sound like a manipulative monster here - she is a good person who came upon hard times, yet still truly loves her animals with all her heart. If anyone is interested in learning about the pets, here is a Dodo video about them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0QUBbYoNAk

"I think my cat has hyperthyroidism, how do I aid her health without paying a ton.
Hi! Just looking for some safe advice. I’m no vet but I’m pretty sure my 14 going on 15 year old sphynx has hyperthyroidism. She occasionally defecates outside the box, Vocalizes at night, and at random during the day. Often times she will meow and lead me around the room or she will meow and just stare at me. And it’s a very loud meow, like with all her voice. She also drinks a lot of water and pees a lot. I noticed urine is often caked in one corner of the box every week when I change it. She eats pretty regularly, and has always been a smaller kitty but I’ve noticed that she has lost a good amount of muscle mass within the past year and a half. With this being said, I think she has hyperthyroidism. But I can’t afford testing, and I don’t want to put her under anesthesia at her old age in fear that she might not wake up. 
(Extra context, I’m a jobless college student on my own, I took my cat with me because she was being neglected by my siblings during the first year of college.)

So I for the most part have been trying to give her the best life. Is this okay? I feel like I’m failing her. I probably am. 

My questions:
-Does anybody have any solutions about how I can help her further with out putting her through harsh testing and paying a fortune?
 -Is she in pain, is that why she cry’s at night?
-She’s been having these problems for a while about 5 or 6 years. I know she’s old but how much longer does she have?
-what are some safe ways that I can improve her health? Without a proper diagnosis. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hcrqz1/i_think_my_cat_has_hyperthyroidism_how_do_i_aid/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"TL;DR.   What you are asking for is not what you think you are asking for.

There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what a veterinarian's  health certificate is.  The casual reader would expect that a health certificate is a certificate certifying that an animal is healthy.

It is not. 

A veterinary health certificate is a government document certifying that the animal meets a certain set of requirements for import/export purposes.  We're talking age,  vaccinations, parasite treatments, etc.  If you read the fine print, most say something vague like the animal is ""apparently healthy"" or "" free from visible signs of communicable disease.""  The veterinarian fills it out acting as an accredited government agent of USDA/APHIS.  

So when you call up a vet clinic and ask about a ""health certificate, "" that's what they are thinking about.  What you are thinking about is a statement from the veterinarian that he has examined the animal and found it to be normal within the limits of the exam.  That's different. 

Back to your question: In my state if a vet vaccinates a companion animal, said vet needs to do a physical exam first, and that exam must be documented in a medical record.  Your state may be different,  but in my state if the vet doesn't have a record it means (s)he never saw the puppy.

If there is a medical record, the vet still won't fill out a health certificate based on that record because health certificates have dates on them, and an exam done in the past won't suffice for a certificate written today.  Remember, the vet is thinking of a different kind of certificate than you are.

If you want a statement that the puppy was examined on such a date and was found to be normal within the limits of the exam, that should be doable, but remember,  somebody has to write the statement and the vet has to sign it, and by doing so assumes a fair amount of liability, and it is perfectly reasonable to expect some compensation for that.  

Also, in my state the law requires that the owner of record of the puppy (the breeder, because that's who owned it at the time the record was produced,  must give written consent for the record to be released to you, a third party.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1i0uyc0/breeder_doesnt_have_puppy_health_certificate/#m71cn44,,,,,,,,,,,,

"EMERGENCY....animal hospital sent my dog home and I don't know what to do to comfort him! I have a 19 year old westie. He's been fairly good health wise up til now but over the last week we had a massive health issue with his kidneys. Need to comfort him!!!
We didn't know he had kidney disease. Last week  went from doing ok, as in we'd go for daily walks &  no one could believe his age! He took a 1x/month shot for arthritis & that's it. The only other issue we had was, we had to monitor how much/ how fast he ate/drank bc we worried about bloat. He'd get to the point he would be in pain/need to throw up when this happened. On the rare occasion he didn't throw up within 5 minutes, we'd give tsp peroxide. (Only had to do this maybe 5 times/5 yrs. . 

Then  last weekend he & my other dog had diarrhea for a few days. I attributed it to them recently being around another dog that possibly had worms & treated them both. Younger dog got better but my 19 year old continued to have diarrhea. He was already dehydrated because we constantly have to pull up his water dish so he doesn't make himself throw up & then put it back down. 

Then Sunday, woke up & he'd thrown up half digested food from night before. That never happens. It's always food he literally just ate that doesn't even start to digest. And he had blood in his poop. 

Then he started to act like he does when he drinks too much/too fast except he hadn't had that much & I didn't think he drank that fast either.  When hes going to throw up, he paces back & forth whining &if it's bad enough, he starts howling. This is when we'd do the peroxide if he didn't vomit shortly after. So he was like that, I gave him a tsp peroxide &still didn't vomit. I know  I can give him up to 2 addl tsp but I've never had to do that before. I ended up giving 1 more,  w the understanding if he didn't vomit,  we'd take him to ER vet. 

He didn't vomit. But then magically just laid down like he was fine. I was highly concerned at this point & called the nearest animal hospital. They did think he should be seen, but they couldn't take us bc they were  full. Told us what to watch for overnight & if need be, go to next one 3 hrs away. Contact them too..also full. 

So we waited overnight and thankfully didn't have any major episodes but still having splotches of red blood in poop. Called vet right away Monday morning and brought him in. They put him into their animal hospital. Ran blood tests and xrays. Xrays showed enlarged liver and prostate but we knew that already and were monitoring with vet. No blockage though. But the blood work showed kidney disease, possible kidney failure. 

They put him on an IV to hydrate and gave him antinausea meds. He was there until this afternoon when they had me come get him. He hadn't eaten except a tiny bit there so it was more or less like ok take him home and see if you can get him to eat. They gave him antinausea meds and antibiotics to take home.  1)Problem is he's not eating so how do I get him to take those for one. 

2) how can I get him to eat, even a little. Can I force some to back of tongue? Clearly I don't want him to inhale or choke on anything but desperately need him to eat. 

And 3) he doesn't have to drink much at all right now to get to that vomit point. I'm trying to wrap my head around what's causing that and what to do when he's like that because he sounds like he's in a lot of pain when it's going on😭😭. Usually I will pat his back like burping a baby and he will ""dig"" on a cushion until he vomits but now it's going on for a while before he does. I'm not sure if I should be giving peroxide or not. 

4) is there anything like pedialyte I can give him for electrolytes? I know not pedialyte itself, but something for dogs in this condition? 

This dog is my life. I don't want him to suffer of course. But i also want to help if he can make it through this somehow. He was ""ok"" just last week! ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1iitsoa/emergencyanimal_hospital_sent_my_dog_home_and_i/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,">Problem is he's not eating so how do I get him to take those for one. 

Your dog needs more hospitalized care. If he isn't able to take oral medications, he needs to be in a hospital where they can rely on injectable medications. I wouldn't necessarily wait until the morning. Emergency clinics are an option.

>how can I get him to eat, even a little. Can I force some to back of tongue? Clearly I don't want him to inhale or choke on anything but desperately need him to eat

You can't force him to eat. He will be at risk of aspirating then getting pneumonia. He will also get food aversion and even more so not want to eat anything.

>he doesn't have to drink much at all right now to get to that vomit point.

Even more so, he needs aggressive hospitalization care.

>is there anything like pedialyte I can give him for electrolytes? I know not pedialyte itself, but something for dogs in this condition?

No, because if they can't drink by themselves, you'll risk causing aspiration pneumonia if you force them.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1iitsoa/emergencyanimal_hospital_sent_my_dog_home_and_i/#mb9iqh1,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Grumpy old man or health issues?
I have an 8yo altered male cat, about 12lbs, indoor ONLY who has recently become very aggressive. I found him under a dumpster when he was VERY young, and had him ever since. This cat has been through A LOT with me — about ten moves, multiple different roommate situations, different animal friends, etc. and he’s tolerated it all pretty well. I also have one other cat — an altered indoor only female and two golden retrievers that don’t show much interest in the cats. Last June, my boyfriend and his doodle moved in with me and I feel like his aggression has really ramped up. The doodle is definitely more interested in the cats than the other two dogs, but he’s not aggressive. The cats have their own spaces where the dogs DO NOT go. The only other notable change is that he’s intentionally lost weight through reduced feeding amounts (it needed to happen), but he’s been getting the same amount of food for ~3mos now, and is eating the recommended serving on the bag (I know that’s just a guideline, but he’s maintaining weight well). 
His aggression is when people touch him — even me which is very abnormal. He will come sit on me as per usual, but when I move or pet him, he screams and sometimes swats or bites. Since he is a bigger cat, he can easily do some damage. 
I have scheduled a vet appt for him, but am curious as to what underlying health issues this could be. 

Before you say it — yes we have a lot of indoor pets 😅

"New rescue dog has long list of health issues how did the vet missed them all?
So we rescued a dog about two weeks ago, the shelter said she was healthy and tested negative for heart worm and gave us a list of vets that offer a free first exam for new pets. We took her during the first week and told them she was very congested and I was worried about kennel cough as well as her swollen vulva, and I just wanted an overall exam to make sure she was healthy (she looked like she was bred before being dumped). 

They took her to the back for her exam, brought her back and said she’s healthy, that she just has some allergies and her genitals would level out after she healed from her spay. They mentioned that she was missing some teeth but that it wasn’t anything to worry about. A few days later she was acting more sick and coughing, and my first dog also had a cough. Took them both to the vet and they both have kennel cough and giardia. The new rescue dog also has an advance UTI, kidney stones, a kidney infection, a broken tooth that has abscessed, what looks like fragments of worms/parasites in her eyes, and her chest x-ray showed she has an enlarged and abnormal heart. It’s just too many things I’m losing my mind. 

We are waiting on the results of the heat treated heart worm test and treating the infections she has with antibiotics, dewormers, and prescription food. But i just want to know how anyone could miss all of this? I understand false negatives and what not, but I don’t understand why the first examiner or even the shelter didn’t notice her excessive diarrhea, irregular peeing habits, constant coughing/sneezing, or the uti/kidney problems.

"Urgent Help Needed for My Possibly Pregnant Cat with Health Issues
Hi everyone! I'm really concerned about my cat who had a stray cat mother. For context, I am a teen who l**ives in a third world country where quality vet access is limited**, and we have recently been suffering financially so providing the best lifestyle they deserve is not possible for some time even if I want to. Please help me I'm freaking out.

**Specie and breed are not confirmed (I realized I can't attach pictures but she looks like Domestic Shorthair), 8 months old, not neutered, medium body weight 9\~10 lbs.**

**History**: She was given birth in our home, 8 months ago. Not vaccinated. She was sneezing some weeks ago, which we consulted to a vet who prescribed an injection. She was fine since then. She's active but is often hungry. **I feed her 3 pieces of microwaved chicken thrice daily. I tried to make her habitual of eating boiled chicken gradually but she didn't like the taste.** She lives on our clean terrace. She has a home which included multiple blankets. It's warm but potentially unsafe since some days ago I saw a male cat who threatened and tried to scratch her. I also have a male cat (not neutered, healthy, 8 months old) who's my cat's brother. He is calm but scratches her often at night. **I want to shift her inside our house since it would be more comfy and safe for her.** On terrace, she has her litter box, meal bowl, and fresh water. **She wanders outside (which is safe from vehicles and potential threats BUT at night 1-2 male cats stroll around). Yesterday, she had a scar on her back neck.** I asked my vet for an appointment but he was closed for appointments nor did he suggest an ointment.

**Clinical signs:**

**1**. Belly size is increased. She's skinny elsewhere. She's more clingy and hungry now. It appears as if she wants more rest. She has no difficulty moving but doesn't want to get lifted. She has slight runny rose sometimes. Her breasts are increasing (but no appearance of ""pink nipples"". No signs of milk production. We've noticed these signs a week ago. What can I do to ensure that she's pregnant and well? How to ensure a healthy diet, living place, and her safety?

**2**. Both of my cats have black specks inside their ear. They scratch their head and ears often, and over groom themselves. Is there a possibility of ear mites?

**3**. A month ago, my brother noticed small amounts of blood where my male cat sleeps.

I'm visiting a vet after some hours. Any advice would be appreciated. I will do anything to ensure they're well. If I made some mistakes please mention them and I'll treat them to my best. I've posted in relevant sub-Reddit too. Thanks in advance.

Edit: She is pregnant and has ear mites. She has been prescribed ear drops. I bought cat food too. She can't live indoors since we have a history of asthma and cat allergy. But I'll make sure that she's safe and sound where she usually lives. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j3ys2q/urgent_help_needed_for_my_possibly_pregnant_cat/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1 year old dog has a lot of weird health problems. Are we missing something?
My dog, Pretzel, is a ~50 lb Catahoula mix has had some unusual health problems from a very young age, and I’m wondering if she has some kind of rare syndrome that my vets aren’t considering.

1) Juvenile cataracts developed at ~8 weeks old (she recently had cataract surgery that has restored her vision, which she has healed quite well from!)

2) Hypertrophic osteodystrophy: developed around 6 months old, diagnosed from x-ray, which was done because of limping on one of her right front legs. Vet said that her case was relatively mild. The AI tool they used to over-read the x-ray also noted a vertebral anomaly. 

3) Hip dysplasia: she began having trouble standing up from seated around ~11 months old. We are scheduled to get x-rays to confirm on Tuesday, but she has all of the classic signs☹️

We did an Embark DNA test that was all clear except for being an unaffected carrier of degenerative myelopathy. We have family friends who own two of her littermates, and they haven’t had any health issues except for being whiny babies. She’s had multiple blood panels done, and they’ve come back normal. Her eye surgery was nearly $10,000, so I just want to check and see if there’s anything we could be missing before we spend a lot more money (that we don’t have) on treatment. I just love her so much and I wish I could just make all her pain go away. 

Her Embark profile (if it’s helpful at all): https://app.embarkvet.com/pet/8f7d49be-08e1-4389-ba85-f39bccb40914/about?source=share",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1iptmdp/1_year_old_dog_has_a_lot_of_weird_health_problems/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Health Kinesiology degree but desire vet medicine or animal care work!
Hello, 28 y/o F, I have always loved animals and have always desired to help them or care for them. I went to school and got the wrong degree… health kinesiology… regret so badly but now I want to start a career in my passion. Animals. 

I have heard nightmares about vet school and worst  about vet medicine. 
I also heard that vet tech/assistant being a good route to not do too much schooling but still work with animals. And okay pay? 50k?

Then there are other careers that involve animal care taking or animal biology which involve field work. 
But I heard the min pay is around like 30k which you can’t really live on. 

So I’m not sure which careers with animals actually pay well enough $50-60 k that are obtainable after going to school for the wrong things.. I don’t mind going back to school I just don’t know if I want to go back for vet med. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ieafkf/health_kinesiology_degree_but_desire_vet_medicine/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Sick older kitty with lots of health conditions
Just posted this to r/cathelp a little bit ago, didn’t think to post here at first so I’m sorry it’s kind of a cross post, please let me know if it needs to be taken down!!


Hi all so I have an almost 16 year old male cat who is diabetic as of last year (currently taking 3.5 units of Lantus Glargine after scheduled meals twice a day). The vet also told us after a month of them having the blood work that he has kidney disease (which we could have been doing something about this WHOLE MONTH but we had no idea until they pulled up his chart today). And now he has a heart murmur. And he gets chronic colds/congestion in his nose (sneezing the BIG bogeys) which he gets an antibiotic shot every 3-4 months for to help him clear it up.

Well he currently has this cold, received his shot 12 days ago and it is still going strong. This poor man is breathing through his nose still but you can hear how congested he is. I’ve been bringing him into the bathroom and running a hot bath/shower to steam up the room to help break some of it up, cleaning his nose with a soft tissue and warm water etc. but he is not feeling well. On top of this he (the usually constantly hungry boy) decided he’s not hungry and barely ate anything save part of a nulo stick and some Hills Science urgent care wet food I managed to get into his mouth (only 3-4 little bites). At his appointment yesterday the vet said it’s probably because of his nose that he doesn’t want to eat but his glucose was also VERY high when they measured it there (710!!!!!) to which they suggested we go ahead and give him his 3.5 units of insulin even if he doesn’t eat. I’m having a very hard time with this veterinary office as the Drs are all rotational between this office and another so it’s a roll of the dice who you get. He has another appointment at 2pm today but I plan on taking him at 8am when they open if I don’t run to the ER…..my only issue with the ER is that they pushed REALLY hard when he was there last when we discovered he had diabetes for me to have him euthanized then and there. He came home with me after a day of fluids and was fine up until now so I am just worried they won’t want to do anything for him again due to his age. It is also currently -10 degrees Fahrenheit outside here and I also fear taking him out in this even briefly from building to car might hurt him more. 

He received an anti-nausea shot as well as fluids for dehydration yesterday but only a little as they said more would affect his heart murmur. He is just laying around, getting up to drink water and is very weak (hind legs especially, he is wobbly). I feel my vet is not informing me well enough about these things and/or also just does not care enough because he is older. 

If anyone has advice please please let me know. I’ve been up reading about things I can do to help him and monitoring him all night (he was sleeping peacefully for a while there). ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1i7825s/sick_older_kitty_with_lots_of_health_conditions/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Goldendoodle Pup with ongoing health issues - Diarrhea, stunted growth
Species:dog

Age: 8 months 

Sex/Neuter status:male /non-neutered

Breed:goldendoodle

Body weight: 40 lbs

History: Our pup, from a trusted breeder, gained weight quickly at first but has since slowed (3 lbs in two months) and appears underweight. He had persistent paw chewing, so we switched from Purina Pro Chicken to PP Sensitive Stomach Lamb to good effect. 

In December, he developed foul-smelling, bloody diarrhea. Tests were negative except for C. Perfringens overgrowth. He improved after flagyl, Fortiflora, and a bland diet. Now, months later, he had another severe bout—explosive diarrhea, bloody stools, and decreased appetite (but not lethargic, playful, and appears otherwise ok). The vet found low cortisol (0.9, normal 2-6) and suggested screening for Addison’s, but I work in healthcare and question the diagnosis given how our pup looks, and two isolated episodes of diarrhea. No littermates have similar issues per the breeder.

He's now on flagyl, dewormer, probiotics, and a beef/rice diet, but he's biting his feet again. Maybe he's allergic to beef too. Wondering if I should just switch to raw meat diet or some other alternative? 

Links to test results, X-rays, vet reports etc:

Test results from hospital visit few days ago
Sodium 155
Potassium 4.8
Cortisol 0.9
Stool PCR neg. 
Glucose normal. 

Just looking for advice. Clinically he does not have typical Addisonian symptoms and don't know how much it's worth to chase an ACTH stim test and further testing. I truly think it's a diet issue. He has good energy, plays, drinks well and never looks dehydrated/urinates excessively.

"Need advice on my 16-year-old Havanese dog's sudden anemia and health decline
My 16-year-old Havanese dog was admitted to the hospital last night after experiencing major changes in his energy and mood over the past 48 hours. He went from running around excitedly and eager to eat to being completely limp and barely able to walk or keep his eyes open, all within 24 hours. Blood work revealed that he’s extremely anemic, although the vet didn’t think it was related to his liver or kidneys. I don’t remember the exact number, but the vet mentioned something like a 1.23 red blood cell count. He said it was extreme.

They’ve presented me with the option of starting a blood transfusion, which could provide him with temporary comfort, but it wouldn’t address the underlying cause. At 16, the vet is unsure what the next steps would be once a diagnosis is reached and if there even would be one.

I’m reaching out to see if anyone has gone through something similar or has advice on what to do next. My main priority is his comfort, and I don’t want him to suffer. The hardest part is how quickly his condition has changed, and I’m torn between pursuing numerous tests and transfusions or focusing on keeping him comfortable. At his age, I’m unsure what the best course of action is.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j56n6c/need_advice_on_my_16yearold_havanese_dogs_sudden/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Are Greenie-style treats worth it for my greyhound’s dental health?
Hi vets! Not an emergency, just a dog owner looking to watch my budget. 

Are “Greenie” style dental treats actually worthwhile — that is, do they mechanically remove daily crud from doggy teeth better than any other large, crunchy treat would? 

We give our 80-lb four-year-old neutered male greyhound [one of these Costco-brand off-brand Greenies](https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-dental-chews%2C-72-count.product.100234581.html) each night. He ADORES them, but they’re quite expensive — about $.36 USD/each — and I’ve noticed they don’t actually have the Veterinary Oral Health Council seal of approval on the box! 

I know keeping on top of our boy’s dental health is important, what with greyhounds being prone to bad teeth and not being the easiest breed to safely anesthetize for cleaning in their senior years, but do the faux-Greenies actually do anything?

We also use ProDen PlaqueOff powder over his food once a day, add a VOHC-okayed additive to his water bowl, and brush his teeth (though we could be more regular about the latter!). FWIW, he’s always been fed Purina Pro Plan’s higher-protein “sport” mix. His other treats include the occasional yak butter chew, bully stick or dried beef trachea jammed into a holder/toy to worry over. 

So should we keep the Greenies, or would he be just as well off with, say, a traditional (and cheaper!) MilkBone-style crunchy biscuit before bed?

"Cat Returning Health Issue
	⁠Species: Cat
•	⁠Age: 3
•	⁠Sex/Neuter status: Neutered Male
•	⁠Breed: Unknown
•	⁠Body weight: Unknown
•	⁠History: Diagnosed pneumonia and triaditis
•	⁠Clinical signs: Weight loss, coughing/wheezing 
•	⁠Duration: 1 month
•	⁠Your general location: Midwest USA

My cat was ill with the same symptoms as current (as well as vomiting clear fluid and not eating) in September 2024, and after a week of emergency vet visits, including with an 
internist, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and triaditis. He took medicine for the pneumonia and takes nightly medicine for the triaditis. At the time, he received a fecal test, 2 blood tests, two sets of x rays, radiographs. His x rays showed his lungs and heart looking suspicious (enlarged and uneven). I became worried about cardiomyopathy, although this was quickly shot down by multiple vets at the emergency clinic. His lab results came back twice with elevated globulin levels and elevated proteins. He was then tested for feline infectious peritonitis which came back negative. He was also tested for toxoplasmosis, which came back negative. 

After taking pneumonia medication, prednisone, simethicone and his daily triaditis medication he gained his weight back and stopped with respiratory symptoms, but now he displays the same symptoms minus the vomiting and not eating. 

I have no idea what is wrong with him, but obviously I am very worried and would appreciate any guidance. I plan to make an appointment with a vet this week, but it would be helpful to have an idea of what to bring up when going in.

"German shepherd and digestive health, of course.
Hello, I'm from Spokane Washington. I have a 4.5yr old, female, purebred German shepherd. Being a German shepherd she has a sensitive stomach. Since she was around 1 she's had 5 incidents of bloody stool. I mean all red liquid. Thankfully no other symptoms. No vomiting, no lethargy, no pain. 

During our journey to solve the problem we discovered via xray a possible mass near or on her spleen. She had an ultrasound a few weeks ago and thankfully that mass was actually just her spleen. Now we didn't think that was a factor for her gi issues but we did see parts of her gi were slightly inflamed. But she was having watery stools at this time.

We also did more blood work and the only thing that came back was slightly high folate levels but nothing else. We started giving her 500mg of metronidazole twice a day with hills z/d wet food and rice/oatmeal, with lean boiled ground turkey.

We're supposed to start probiotics Wednesday since she'll have been taking the metronidazole for 2 weeks.

During this time she's had bloody stool twice, it's been a mix of wet, sludgy, a little bloody and some more normal stools. Most coloring has been medium/light brown with occasional orange? No black or dark brown, nothing gritty. She did have some Purina pro plan sensitive skin and stomach kibbles here and there, maybe 1/2 cup total. I keep some in her dish so when she starts eating, I know she's hungry and make her a dish of the prescription food, with rice. She's always been a grazer and not a big eater.

This morning her stool was a thicker watery mess. A light brown mud.

I'm just curious is all this mix of stool consistency normal? She hasn't anything solid for a while. I'm thinking about starting her probiotics early. She still has no other symptoms, everything is normal as ever. 

I'm also curious if the blood is from something inside getting torn, then healing? Since she's been on the same food, hasn't even had a bone, I haven't let her chew on sticks. I'm with my girl all the time as I don't work. I'm just trying to figure out the problem. I'm starting to think it's not food related. And our next step would be seeing a specialist for digestive health, who would be taking samples all through out her intestines. Which I have no problem with. Just curious if this seems like it's actually food related?

I'll be asking my vet as well just trying to figure it out.

I was told that if it's not a kidney infection, the other 2 illnesses that she suspects him to have do not have positive outcomes and very costly and that I should euthanize him. At that moment, I decided to treat it as if he has the infection. 

She called me the next day to ask how he was doing on his antis and to tell me thats the results of his urine test was negative for infection and that his kidney functions are normal. Im not a doctor, but hearing that his kidneys were normal made me think he either doesnt have cancer or that its early enough to help him through it. So inquired about treating him for FIP until I save for an ultrasound to see if he had cancer (which my job would provide treatment for). She said no, and that treatment will only buy him a few months at best and brought up euthanasia again. So I went on FIP Warriors on FB and got a vial of GS. According to many of them, their cats are still alive many years after the 12 wks of treatment. The day after his first dose it was almost night and day. It could be his antis or it could be the GS treatment, idk, but he's doing better. Still sluggish, but eating a little more, and not sleeping all day nonetheless

I planned to continue buying the FIP treatments online, but at the same time I was hoping she'd prescribe it so his insurance would cover it.  She's been my vet for many years and even the vet for my childhood pets when my mom was alive. She's the kindest most sympathic human being on the planet. I want her to be apart of his path to a healthy life again, but I'm nervous that she'd be against my choice and not help 

Am I completely overthinking because I'm stressed af rn? Should I suck it up and tell her how should I word it? Should I just go to a different vet for the time being? Have you ever been in a situation?

It also may be that your vet doesn’t know a lot about GS treatment - it is newish and hasn’t been legal until a few months ago so some vets aren’t up to speed. Most cats with FIP do get better with GS as long as they get it in time.

,"This is a really new drug and the only treatment prior to this to avoid a long drawn out and painful death was euthanasia.

My best friend did this treatment with her cat when it was still illegal to prescribe the US, and he survived BUT she still had to take him to the vet for regular checkups and blood work. It was VERY expensive. She kept the vet up to date on the treatment she was doing and honestly he was fascinated by it but could not prescribe it to her for legal reasons. Before she mentioned it to him, he was completely unaware of its existence. 

I don't know that your vet isn't being empathetic, they might be trying to potentially save you watching your kitty suffer.

,"Just because a dog was “rescued” does not mean that you, the current owner of the dog, should be absolved of any future responsibility toward this dog. For example, when the veterinarian says “there is a large mass present in the second left mammary gland which is very hard and starting to ulcerate. I recommend surgical excision and biopsy,” the appropriate answer is not “well, she was rescued, so, you know, she came with that.” You can say “I don’t want to do that,” or “I can’t afford that,” or “are there any other options because that sounds extreme” but stop using “she was rescued” as an excuse for everything. See also: “your dog is obese,” “your dog is dangerously aggressive,” and “your dog has heart disease” — these are other things that owners have responded to by saying “well, he/she is a rescue.” I mean - it’s all I can do not to reply “objection, your honor - relevance!?”

Also - if your veterinarian says your pet is in pain, your pet is probably in pain. Your pet may very well still: eat and drink, move about, act friendly, go on walks, use the litterbox, and engage in other activities of daily living even though it is in pain. When you are in pain, don’t you also eat, drink, go to work, pretend everything is ok, use the bathroom, etc etc? Half the time I am telling someone their pet is in pain, I am standing there in pain myself due to intervertebral disc disease that has plagued me for years, and it’s just so annoying to have someone say, with respect to their dog who will not bear weight on one of his legs at all, “well, I don’t think he’s in pain, he’s still eating and drinking and acting normal, he just won’t use his leg.” WHY DO YOU THINK HE IS NOT USING HIS LEG?",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1bw7xvj/as_a_vet_what_is_some_unsolicited_advice_youre/#ky5hbzl,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Older animals declining in health should not be chalked up to “old age” and ignored. In general, if your older animal is losing weight, losing energy, not eating as much (or eating much more than normal), slow to rise, loses desire to play or losing interest in things they used to love… it’s not just “old age”. Age is not a disease. Aging alone does not cause these things, but health issues that accompany old age can. For most of these health issues, the sooner we diagnose and address them, very often the longer we can keep our pets around and the more comfortable we can keep them during that time. I can’t count how many times I’ve seen people with older dogs and cats saying that they’ve had declining health for months (or years!) and attributing it to old age, waiting until it’s quite severe, and then wondering if it’s time to put them down without ever having addressed these issues at a vet. I’ve seen many pets come in with disease festering for months, where we could have done so much if they had brought them in at the first sign of changes, but it’s so advanced that now our options are very limited. Some people don’t know that these aren’t “normal” changes, and some people just assume that because they’re old there is nothing that can be done and are scared to be told to put their pet down. Please don’t do this. If your pet has changes in their health, even if they’re old, it’s important to find out WHY. The sooner the better. Don’t ignore it until it becomes severe, and don’t just assume nothing can be done without even trying to figure out what’s wrong in the first place. 

My second unsolicited piece of advice is to keep your vet in the loop about how your pet is doing. If you bring them in and get a tentative/presumptive diagnosis and are sent home with meds, then the next day the pet is doing worse or has new issues show up, or if the meds don’t help in the expected time frame, tell your vet!! Don’t just assume that they can’t help further, don’t assume that their initial approach was inherently wrong, don’t even necessarily jump straight to a second opinion with another vet. Health is very complex and dynamic, and even more so because animals cannot outright tell us what is going on. We have to do the best we can with what we have, and if we don’t know how the pet is, we can’t adjust course. Call your vet and let them know what has changed (or NOT changed as expected) and give them a chance to adjust their recommendations with the new information. Constantly jumping to new vets when they don’t immediately solve the problem ruins continuity of care and makes it hard for any one person to have all the puzzle pieces of what has already been done. If your vet tells you they are out of ideas or you don’t feel your concerns are being heard, by all means seek a second opinion. But just because one visit didn’t magically solve complex health issues doesn’t mean you should jump ship. Keep the vet in the loop and they can help you so much better.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1bw7xvj/as_a_vet_what_is_some_unsolicited_advice_youre/#ky4r465,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I need advice before responding to an email I got from my vet.
Hello,

I need some advice before I respond to an email I got from my vet's office today... I'm just not sure how to feel about it or what the best way to respond is. They essentially told me that I owe them more money?? and can buy Rx food from them, after asking for a written prescription to order it online from a different pharmacy.

I took my cat in a week ago to have a ""sick exam"" because she was very restless and having diarrhea. She is a senior kitty and I was prepared for them to run a couple tests. They did bloodwork and a urine sample in-house. The results showed that she had a UTI but her bloodwork looked good. They wanted to treat with antibiotics for the UTI and Rx food for the diarrhea. We opted for an antibiotic injection over oral meds and said we would look over the food options before we ordered one. I prepaid $106 to schedule the exam and I paid $464 at the end of the appointment. The receipt is not itemized, which made me lightly uncomfortable, but I assumed it was correct.

We decided to order one of the Rx foods that was recommended and after being told by the pet pharmacy that they would contact the vet for authorization they turned around and told me that I have to get the authorization for them and send it to them. I replied to my vet's appt summary email (since they rarely answer the phone) that had the food options listed in it and asked if we could have the written prescription or authorization. They wrote back saying that they tried to call me (I have no call or voicemail from them) and that I owe for the antibiotic injection and that I can order the food through their website.

I feel blindsided that they think I still owe them money and that they aren't willing to let me order the food from a different pharmacy.?. I have taken my pets to this clinic for several years and this isn't the first issue I've had with them, but I think it will be the last time I ever go there.

How would you address this?? Do I owe them anything more if it's their mistake? Especially after the other mistakes they made (Including accidently hitting me in the face once with a gold watch when my rabbit jumped on the exam table - leaving me a with a bruise and headache which I never complained about.....) Why wasn't my receipt itemized?  Shouldn't I be allowed to order food from a different pharmacy?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1f96vsk/i_need_advice_before_responding_to_an_email_i_got/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"New Kitten - Advice please! Wife wants to return him to shelter but I want to give him a chance.
Hello fellow Redditors!

We recently welcomed a new kitten into our home and have been keeping him separated in our office, apart from the rest of the house, primarily because we already have another cat. Yesterday, we decided to let our new kitten venture out and explore his surroundings. To our delight, he seemed to get along quite well with our resident cat.

However, we encountered a problem - our little newcomer urinated on our sofa. Initially, we wrote this off as a mere accident, considering he had been consistent with using the litter box in the office up until then. But, to our dismay, the situation repeated itself today with him urinating on our bed.

We're feeling a bit at a loss here. Is this a normal part of a kitten's adjustment process to a new home or should we be concerned? If any of you have dealt with similar issues or have any tips on how we could manage this situation, we'd greatly appreciate your advice!

Kittens are babies and they are cats, not humans. Humans pee in diapers when they're babies, kittens pee... where they feel it's a good place to pee. We learn our human babies to use the toilet, so we do with the kitties. Have some patience. When you catch him at the act, quickly move him to the sand. You can always put the kitty gently in the sand and mimick with his paws digging the sand and press his butt down and mimick the sound of peeing. When your older cat goes on sand, take the kittie and make him watch. Baby needs to learn. And for the pee accidents on couch, enzyme cleaner is your friend.

for context, the cat is in my parents care, he's not actually mine or under my care. but my parents really only care for the dogs and ignore the cats. so basically, if this is concern enough to take the kitty to a vet, then i need to know that it could be very bad, otherwise, my parents just won't care and will do the ""wait and see"" approach.


around 3-4am my sibling woke up to find the cat chewing on a bag of Rimadyl 75mg pills. we don't know how much he ate, but he's been throwing up quite a lot, all morning. he hasn't exhibited any other signs of pain or discomfort, but i'm not sure if i'd be able to notice if he was in pain, i heard that cats are good at disguising their pain until it becomes unbearable. if there's any subtle signs i need to look for, please, let me know.

my sibling told our parents that the cat got into those pills and they should take him to a vet, but our parents are dismissive when it comes to the cats so idk if they will care or make it a priority. i tried googling what happens when an adult cat gets into this dose of rimadyl and it's not good... GI ulcers? kidney failure? liver failure?? all things that could happen with that dose .. it seems like he's done puking now but it was a lot so im worried. any advice or any cause to have serious worry? 


also if there's anything i can tell my parents that will make them take him to a vet?????? also no it was not hairballs. too much vomit and not the same consistency or smell or look.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j88box/my_cat_got_into_rimadyl_75mg_lots_of_vomiting/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"A single one of those tablets is likely to be a lethal dose for a cat. Vomiting, especially at this point, is not getting the medication out of the system as it has already been absorbed. Meds are not in the stomach very long before they move further down the GI tract and are absorbed. The vomiting at this point is very likely due to the medications effects, namely damage to the GI tract and kidney damage/failure leading to a build up of toxins in the blood and nausea. If this cat had been taken to an emergency vet and hospitalized IMMEDIATELY after eating the rimadyl (up to a max of about 4 hours after) I would say he had a fair shot at pulling through. Now, with clinical signs developing, vomiting and increased thirst being extremely concerning for kidney damage, his chances are poor even with intense hospitalization. Very likely that irreversible damage has already been done. His chances without any vet care is grave. Death by kidney failure is an agonizing and drawn out way to go. If you cannot afford hospitalization, then humane euthanasia is warranted. Not seeking vet care in this case is not acceptable and falling into the territory of animal cruelty and neglect. He’s very likely to continue to decline. The more he declines the lower his chances of pulling through. Humane euthanasia at that point is no longer optional, it is the absolute bare minimum. Doing anything else may be a prosecutable criminal offense depending on your location. Your parents don’t get to be blasé about it when an animal under their care is suffering to death. Please do not allow that to happen. Your cat deserves better.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j88box/my_cat_got_into_rimadyl_75mg_lots_of_vomiting/#mh4xijq,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A friend of mine who is a vet, said something crazy, need advice from other vets.
This post is not a joke. I’m entirely sincere. 

Basically the question/statement is this. My friend who is a vet said she was surprised by how many dogs had the same disease or illness as their owners. Said that she noticed this a lot.

Seems crazy to me. But then…

Here I am. With a service dog, for my Lupus. That I have, and have had before he was born. The dog is 9 and is experiencing many lupus like symptoms. He has rashes, bacterial skin infections recently like staph, lameness issues, joint swelling and most recently IMPA is suspected. We are doing a flush and starting him on a shit ton of prednisone in 72 hours.

And I’m just like… WTF UNIVERSE! And yea he is not diagnosed with Lupus. But I’m like… if it is lupus. How the fuck do I get to live a life where I and my lupus service dog get lupus? That’s insane. The odds are insane. 

So my question is this, have you all found that often dogs and their humans share illnesses?

"Newly adopted cat requires costly dental work — need advice 
Hi, all. I adopted a one-year-old cat two weeks ago -- he's great! But I took him to the vet this weekend, mainly to establish care, where I was informed he has a tooth lesion and will require an extraction. I just got the estimate and it's a whopping $2,500. I was not expecting to pay so much on care so soon. It's more than I pay for rent. I don't have pet insurance yet. I'm hoping for any recommendations that might help make this more affordable. Are there any insurances that would help cover this if I signed up now, for instance? Any tips are appreciated.

1) Call the shelter and let them know. See if they would be willing to cover it or if they have an in house vet that would do it. It was clearly a condition he had before adoption that was not disclosed to you. Either they missed or they knew and didn’t tell you. Either way they should cover it. 

2) Get pet insurance immediately. This is now a preexisting condition so it won’t be covered like it would have if you’d gotten insurance before taking the cat to the vet and done the waiting period but your cat still needs it. While theoretically you could get the insurance now then wait the waiting period you’d have to go to a new vet and not disclose and that would be insurance fraud and could get your whole policy cancelled if discovered so do not go that route. You should still get the insurance in case anything else comes up.

"My dog ​​needs some advice on her right hind leg.
My dog is a West Highland White Terrier, under 1 year old. She had an X-ray taken at a local vet clinic, and they said she has a hip fracture.

x-ray：https://imgur.com/a/bs5yzgc

However, she can still run, jump, and move normally, with only a slight limp. After the vet examined her leg, her limping got worse, but she is improving again.

The vet suggested Femoral Head Ostectomy (FHO) surgery, but I am not sure if it is necessary.

In China, most vets have no professional ethics. They looked at the same x-ray, gave different reasons, and ultimately had no other treatment options but to perform surgery to remove the hip joint of my dog's right leg.

It is 22cm tall at the shoulder and can now easily jump onto a platform over 45cm high and can get down and up again at any time. It usually has a slight limp and does not show any pain, but when the veterinarian examines it, he will be forced to bend its thighs and it will hurt.

I don't want her to lose her hip easily, nor do I want the Chinese vet to cause her secondary injury. Please help me  


Could you please check the X-ray and tell me:

1. Is it a complete fracture or just a hairline fracture?

2. Can this heal on its own with rest, or does it require surgery?

3. If surgery is necessary, is there an option to fix the femoral head instead of removing it (FHO)?

"Dog died this morning. Need advice if they suffered long. 
She got diagnosed with a huge spleen mass on Xmas day. They said few weeks or a month. I haven’t left her side for entire time - cook meals, went on beach walks, just wanted to give comfort. I vet check recently and said no internal bleeding yet and was just uncomfortable. Was planing out euthanasia for this week. I know I waited too long. She went to bed fine and went to the park earlier. 

This morning woke up to gasping. I got over to her bed (next to mine) and maybe got 10 seconds of her last breath. She died staring upward, maybe not even at me, twisting. I’ll never know how long she was there suffering. I’ve stayed up all night listening to her breath many night and this night I was too tired. Without knowing dog or seeing scans, any advice on how to cope or evidence I can hold into that it might have been quick. 

I can’t forgive myself for waiting and the image of her fighting for air.

"I’m terrified for my dog to have a dental. I’m hoping for some advice 🙏🏻

Hi everyone! Hoping someone can help.

My dog is 12yo next month. Collie mix. Extremely healthy, really the same as she was at 7yo. She has high ALTs (290) which is assumed to be becuase she has a very small liver. She gets yearly ultrasounds to check it.

She just had her preop labs and ultrasound last week, so all is good there.

I have always brushed her teeth so she hasn't ever really needed a dental. Just in the past year I've seen some plaque build up on her teeth, breath smells maybe a tiny bit more but not really.

She's my soulmate. And she's never had anesthesia before. She was spayed before I got her, and I figured at some point she'd need a lump or bump off, and I'd have her have a dental then. But she's been perfect.

I have a dental scheduled for her next week but I am TERRIFIED. All my intuition says not to do it. I have good intuition, but I also have high anxiety lol, so who knows at this point.

I also practice human anesthesiology, maybe that's why I'm more scared.

My other dog is scheduled to have back surgery this month, and I'm not as afraid for that. Maybe because it's totally necessary?

I've read so many stories of people who's dogs passed during a dental and I would just die if that happened.

If anyone has any advice for me about how to get through it, or the chance of something going wrong, or the level of anesthesia for a dental, or if I should just not do it and keep brushing her teeth, maybe 2x per day, I'm all ears.

Thank you in advance.
I would add photos of her teeth if I could but it won't let me. They really are not bad.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ik31sb/im_terrified_for_my_dog_to_have_a_dental_im/,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you know your dog has a history of their temperature dropping or raising under anesthesia, this is something to tell your vet as it’s very helpful to know. They’ll make sure to have ice or more blankets available. Also be sure to mention if your dog has had to take any medication and the dose beforehand. This is all very important.

"My dog is allergic to absolutely everything!
Help , advice needed 
I did an allergy test, and my dog is literally allergic to everything. I have no idea what to feed him. He’s a 7-year-old Japanese Akita Inu, and this summer, he’s been scratching, feeling itchy, and has scabs and hot spots all over his body. He’s been taken to the vet multiple times for scratching his ears and legs, licking his paws, etc. This usually happens during the hot summer days, while in winter, he’s been more calm in previous years.

The allergy test showed that he’s allergic to everything, even the environment, and I don’t know what to feed him.

Lately, I’ve been feeding him dry food with salmon, and he’s been eating a lot of sardines. The vet told us to wash him with a specific shampoo at least once a week to help with the itching, but that hasn’t worked at all.

Any ideas on what to do and what to feed him?

They give him some prescription also for a week \[ prednizon \] 6 pills a day

Below are the results of the allergy test.

In addition to aggressive topical therapy and resolution of any current Infections, you should speak to your vet about chronic therapy with medications like apoquel, cytopoint, and cyclosporine.

"My dog has been acting very out of character for over 16 hours (long post but I really need advice 
My dog (a Brittany) spent the weekend at my parents house, where she loves. They have a big backyard and pool and two older dogs and she will spend the whole day outside if she could. 
I went to get her last night and my parents told me she’s been acting weird. Her tail (nub) has been shoved in between her legs and she keeps going into the corner of the bathroom. She didn’t even come to greet me. I went to the bathroom and she got excited and came to me but then immediately went back in the corner. 
I took her out and closed the door. She’s been just acting still so weird, only sitting on the stairs. 

She also keeps breathing out her nose like she’s trying to push something out. 

I brought her home, and she sniffed around all weird like it was foreign then… got in the bathtub. She also just keeps standing by the bed now that the bathroom is closed. 

It’s really freaking me out. She’s acting like a completely different dog. I’d love some advice here 

UPDATE: called an emergency vet yesterday morning they said it didn’t sound like an emergency. He recommended waiting it out to see if it got better or bringing her to a general vet. I brought her to a general vet who said that as far as they can tell she is healthy. I got her bloodwork so we’ll see how she is on the inside. She isn’t as nervous anymore but still blowing out her nose more frequently than usual. 

HUGE MIDDLE FINGER to you MEAN SPIRITED PEOPLE who judged me as a shitty parent for not rushing to the emergency vet. You people aren’t real and you provided absolutely no help, and you should be booted from this page.

"Cost concerns, two dogs needing procedures, not sure what to do, need advice please. 
I’m in a bit of a predicament between my two dogs. Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. 

I have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. 

I also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. 

So here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? 

Please I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. 

For reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. 

Skin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8
*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… 

Dental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE
*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. 

If we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it.

,"A torn cruciate is going to cause lameness until the stifle is stabilized…but often after a few weeks of pain meds they typically aren’t in that much pain per se. The tibia shifts cranial with every step, which is what causes the limp. I would keep him on pain meds and focus on the others for now, personally, and save up for a TPLO. (It’s not ideal to put implants into a dog with that much bacteremia from severe periodontal disease anyway!) For your allergy pup, it’s quite possible that there is an infection that is now resistant to cephalexin. I think piercing a vesicle for a culture sample would be well worth the cost of a culture, as would potentially an Atopica trial. I’ve seen a few dogs who didn’t get enough relief from Apoquel do well on Atopica, but it does take four weeks or so to kick in. The pred should be tapered accordingly. Just some thoughts…

I think there are two big silver linings to this: one, your pups are SO LUCKY to have you!!! You are doing a fantastic job for them. The second is that if you go into clinical practice, this experience gives you tons of empathy and perspective to help your future clients and patients. ❤️❤️❤️",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hxuh07/cost_concerns_two_dogs_needing_procedures_not/#m6cjbor,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Found a baby bat, been taking care of it for 3 days – need urgent advice!
Hey everyone,

Three days ago, I found a baby bat alone on the ground. It’s still alive, but I know it needs proper care, and I want to make sure I’m doing the right things until a rescue center can take it.

So far, I’ve kept it in a ventilated box with a soft cloth to hang onto. I’ve also tried to keep it warm with a wrapped warm water bottle nearby. I haven’t given it milk (since I read cow’s milk is dangerous), but I think he/she might be weak due to the lack of proper food or wáter, I don't know.

I’ve contacted a wildlife rescue, but they haven’t picked it up yet. I don’t know how much longer I can keep it alive without the right formula or care. What else can I do to improve its chances until help arrives?

Any expert advice would be greatly appreciated! Pics attached for reference.

,"I understand the desire to help. Thank you for trying and having a compassionate heart. I know your heart is in the right place and I don’t mean this as a lecture for you specifically but rather for everyone else who reads this so maybe I can spare one more animal from misguided attempts to care for them. I used to work at a facility that would accept orphaned wildlife. I saw many baby animals taken in by good samaritans who tried to help care for them before getting them to the proper authorities. Some of those babies were too far gone due to improper care by the time they reached us to be saved. Some of them were directly killed by the finder’s attempts to help/feed/water/warm them. Some of them were almost certainly not orphaned at all and yet were kidnapped by people who didn’t know better. The ones that were more likely to thrive by far were the ones who were found and brought to us that same day, with no attempts to give them food or water and the absolute bare minimum in handling. With baby animals, they are very sensitive to inappropriate care (for example being fed the wrong things- good job not feeding cow’s milk) and at least for mammals and birds, they cannot survive long periods without eating or getting some form of hydration. After 3 days of no food or hydration, this baby’s organs are very likely shutting down. Sometimes they rally for a short time when they get into experienced hands, but then crash because the damage already done is too great. His chances of pulling through are dropping by the hour. The best and really only thing you can do to help this baby is to take him to a certified rehabber ASAP, or find a vet willing to help free him from his suffering.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j7j31s/found_a_baby_bat_been_taking_care_of_it_for_3/#mgysqef,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My cat passed this in her urine—looking for advice, please.
Hi everyone,

At the beginning of the year, I took my 3-year-old female DSH cat to the vet because she was struggling to urinate and passing blood and mucus.

The vet ruled out a UTI after testing a large sample and suspected cystitis caused by stress (likely NYE fireworks). She was prescribed Loxicom and recovered quickly.
This morning, while cleaning her litter box (immediately after she used it), I found this large mass in her urine—I can’t seem to link it but here is the URL https://imgur.com/a/sTlY6kO. It looks like a piece of tissue and feels firm—it didn't break apart when prodded.

I've called her vet and will be dropping off the sample and taking her in for an appointment later today. In the meantime, I was directed to give her Loxicom. She's been urinating small amounts frequently for the past hour but hasn't passed any blood. Otherwise, she's behaving normally (eating, playing, cuddling). There haven't been any recent changes in our household.

Does anyone have experience with something like this? Could it be related to FLUTD, cancer, or a parasite? I want to be as prepared as possible for the vet visit.

Thank you so much for any advice or insight!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1i99a86/my_cat_passed_this_in_her_urinelooking_for_advice/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My cat attacked me terribly. I need advice ! 
My cat is generally to the aggressive side. He is 4 years old, neutered and vaccinated. He is a stray which I adopted from a foster. There are totally two incidents where he severely tried to tear my arm.
1. ﻿﻿﻿Just about a month ago he was at the window and I was waiting for him to get in and then he spotted another cat which he always tries to fight with. I know how terrible his fights can be with other cats and so I tried to pull him in from the window to avoid it from even starting. But he was in so much anger that he bit my finger and left a few scratches on my hand. I rushed to the doctor and the injury wasn't very deep so I just took a tetanus shot a completed a rabies vaccine course.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Today he came out of a room and sat down on the sofa and was watching outside. There was another orange cat outside that was eating its food. I tried to pet my cat on his head from behind and not even a second of petting him, he grabbed my hand and scratched it and started biting. I tried to get out of it but it didn't help as he was hugging my hand with both his front limbs and his teeth. I was in so much pain that I grabbed him by his neck thinking he would let go but he intensified the bite. This continued for about 30-40s I believe. Finally he let go idk how but he was still trying to get back at me and meowing. My mom came at this point and shooed him away. Blood was dripping all over the floor. I have about 30 scratches on the back of my forearm , some are deep and about 5-6 piercing marks out of which few are deep. I also have some swelling in the back of my palm and where all the scratches are clustered. I went to a clinic right away to dress the wounds. I was and still am in terrible pain.

I can't stop thinking about why he did that. I feel terrible about this whole incident. I love cats, dogs and any other animals but this makes me feel so defeated. I'm scared of them now but at the same time I don't want to be.
What do I do now ? How do I handle such situations with my cat ? What if another time he goes for my face or my eyes? Or if he tries the same with someone else in the house ?
I love him a lot. I've spent so much time with him.
I've hugged and kissed him multiple times but I dread the thought of it now. I dont understand how to handle this situation. Some advice would be really helpful.
Note: I have tried declawing him in the past a few times on my own and by a vet but he get very aggressive and doesn't let us. Also I stopped trying to declaw him as l later realised that he goes out a lot and he might need them to protect himself.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hh0x84/my_cat_attacked_me_terribly_i_need_advice/,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would also talk to your GP vet about the aggression and have him checked out to make sure he isn’t in pain or experiencing any other health issues that could make him irritable. Your vet can also discuss if there are medication options that may help you here. 

Finally, I have never heard of a DIY declaw - but what I know about declawing is that it is very painful for the cat.

,"When you say declawing, are you just talking about trimming his nails? Obviously stop petting him when he is engaging with other cats. That’s a clear trend and he seems very territorial. I’m glad you went to a doctor. Cat bits in general are dangerous in terms of infection and can escalate quickly.

,"This post is so confusing.

First, declawing is a surgical procedure. It’s not nail trimming. If you are actually attempting to declaw your cat at home, you probably should face criminal charges for animal abuse. I’m guessing you have tried clipping your cat’s nails. Maybe continue to stop doing that, as you appear to be regularly annoying the bejeezus out of this poor animal.

Second, have you heard the saying “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results”? If every time your cat goes into attack mode you put your meat sticks within bitey range and end up getting wounded, well maybe just maybe—stay with me here—STOP DOING THAT. Stay away. Start don’ting. Give the cat space. You isn’t helping.

I pet angry cat. I get bit. I pet angry cat again. I get bit again. What should I do.

Don’t pet angry cat. Wait until happy cat. Then pet.

I say this with all love and respect. We have all made the mistake of petting an angry cat. I really want you and your cat to have a good relationship, and for you to not get hurt. It’s okay. Just don’t any more.

One final thought: you never mention it, but it sounds like you are worried about cat fighting. You need to ensure the cats aren’t able to physically interact. Close doors. Keep windows shut. Move the food further away. Take the stray cats to your local shelter so they can get fixed and adopted too.

"Joining my boss in the euthanasia of a dog. Advice?
Hello! I work in a boarding kennel, however we sometimes get surrendered animals. Last week, we had two small dogs come in, a pom and a spitz. They’re both elderly.

The spitz has numerous large lumps (large as in the size of a basketball, I’m not even joking.) on its chest. My boss took it to the vet yesterday and the poor thing is absolutely riddled with cancer. She’s booked in to be pts on Thursday morning.

I’m a kennel worker, not a veterinarian. I work in the animal industry and have for years but I am by no means as experienced as a vet.

My boss was a vet for over a decade, did countless euthanasias. I offered to go with her when the spitz goes to sleep. I’ve enjoyed bonding with the little gal even if our time together has been short. She had a lot of character and personality despite her terminal cancer.

My boss spoke to me and gave me the run down of what will happen. She assured me it’ll be quick. My job is to hold her whilst they administer the IV and the drugs. 

I’ve never experienced a euthanasia in person before. My job is to make sure dogs go home happy and healthy, so this is completely uncharted waters for me. I’m not sure what to expect. 

Fyi- My boss will not be the one euthanising the dog, she just scheduled it and will be with me.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1imugyi/joining_my_boss_in_the_euthanasia_of_a_dog_advice/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Dog ate tampons, conflicting advice from vets
Hello, thanks for reading. At around 7:30 last night, we saw that our dog got into our bathroom trash and ate 3 or 4 used tampons. I immediately took him to the nearest emergency vet and they induced vomiting within the hour. He threw up a tiny amount of kibble-y vomit, nothing else. We were referred to another vet that was better equipped for next steps.

My dog is a 9 year old Cavalier with MVD and a grade 5 heart murmur. Because of this, the vet said he was not an ideal candidate for an endoscopy due to the sedation, and they weren't confident the contents would still be in his stomach at that point, so we could be risking complications for nothing. However, they said they worry about his ability to even survive full exploratory surgery, which absolutely crushed me. They said x-rays wouldn't be useful at that time because tampons wouldn't show.

The vet said there is a possibility that he could pass the obstruction, and recommended ""bulk feeding"" to get things going. We were given 3 cans of Hill's Multi-Benefit and told to feed him 1/3 of a can every 4 hours until gone. They said it's supposed to congeal around the object to help move it through and out.

I have been following this regimen since, but this afternoon I called his usual vet's office for a second opinion. The emergency vet there told me they hadn't heard of this method to pass a bowel obstruction, and they sounded quite trepidatious. They also said the other vet should have been able to see something on x-rays, and they should have been done. They recommended I come in for x-rays and to discuss next steps.

They didn't explicitly tell me to stop his current bulk feeding schedule, so I plan on continuing until I see his vet tomorrow. He's still doing happy spins for every meal and eats it all. He's drinking water. He's had 2 normal poops since The Tampon Eatening. He was very excited to go on his walk earlier (he alternated between sluggish and peppy), and he's been sleeping a lot, but these are normal for him.

TL;DR: Opinions on ""bulk feeding"" an 18 lb Cavalier that ingested multiple tampons? Is it uncommon practice? Could we just be making it worse? I'm worried sick about my little old man.

**Edit: Thanks so much, everybody! Fortunately, he started passing them about an hour after I made this post. I wonder if any neighbors saw me pick his poops apart, celebrate like a prospector, and take pictures to send to my boyfriend at work. He's still acting like his silly and happy self, so we're sticking with the bulk feeding as per doctor's orders and continuing to monitor him. We're very grateful for all the insight we've gotten from y'all!**",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1gcvxj0/dog_ate_tampons_conflicting_advice_from_vets/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"I don't see any purpose for radiographs at this point. Radiographs cannot differentiate between food material vs. tampons in the stomach. There is no purpose in running diagnostics (like radiographs) if it is not going to change the treatment plan. There would is no indication for surgery or for endoscopy (this many hours after ingestion and feeding) if the dog is asymptomatic. IMO as an ER vet at this point continue feeding, unless symptoms arise. If the dog starts vomiting or stops eating, THEN radiographs (or ideally abdominal ultrasound) become indicated. 

Bulk feeding is more commonly performed for ingestion of sharp objects, but the goal of bulk feeding here is to provide a lot of fiber to try to keep the GI tract moving faster than normal.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1gcvxj0/dog_ate_tampons_conflicting_advice_from_vets/#ltx59m8,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"

This is a case where neither of them are wrong, they're just different approaches to the same problem. Bulk feeding is sometimes done to help pass foreign objects. Usually for objects that are somewhat sharp, to try and cover the edges. It sometimes works. We won't know whether it will work for your dog or not so keeping on monitoring for clinical signs (vomiting, lethargy) is important. It's good that your dog is still bright.

You are very unlikely to see a tampon on an x-ray radiograph, especially if your dog has been bulk fed. Tampons generally look just like any other food item in the stomach and intestine. However, if it's causing a blockage, vets will sometimes see weird gas patterns near the tampon that might give them a clue that it's there. Very occasionally, the x-ray catches the tampon at just the right angle for it to look like a tampon, but that's more common on an empty stomach.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1gcvxj0/dog_ate_tampons_conflicting_advice_from_vets/#ltx5pfg,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Not a vet professional, but this comment is about the functionality of xrays so it may be useful.

Xrays work by creating a picture that shows *density*. Bone is very dense. Gasses are not dense at all. Fluids are less dense.

Tampons usually show up on *human* xrays because when you’re changing them frequently the core will be dry and will have gasses trapped, and *that* shows as a kind of void/lower density area inside the body. But once a tampon is saturated - by water or blood or most other liquids - they tend to go invisible or near-invisible on xrays because their density now matches the density of the fluid-filled tissues around them.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1gcvxj0/dog_ate_tampons_conflicting_advice_from_vets/#ltx81fa,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Foreign body cases are always kind of like this. You’ll see a diversity of opinions, and different approaches will appear to yield results at different times.  Will he puke it? Should we try to make him puke it? Can he poop it? Will he need hospitalization? Surgery?

Generally speaking the sicker the dog appears the more concerned I am and the more strongly will I recommend whatever diagnostics will help narrow it down. That being said, we get outliers that look happy but have necrotic intestines in them, or look terrible and have exploratory surgery that yields nothing (a “negative” exploratory). 

I am encouraged that your dog appears fine still. Hopefully you will just see him poop them out (keep checking). If he becomes lethargic, starts vomiting, or appears painful you should take him back to a clinic.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1gcvxj0/dog_ate_tampons_conflicting_advice_from_vets/#ltxma80,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Not a vet, but did used to work in animal shelters without vets, meaning we did a lot of over the phone consults with vets and did treatment ourselves (not surgeries but fluids, injectable’s etc).

Foreign object ingestion usually has multiple treatment options depending on what was ingested, how long prior to treatment it was ingested, and the animals demeanor and symptoms. No symptoms and the object wasn’t sharp or a string? Vets may recommend anything from just monitoring to X-rays or ultrasounds or anything in between (supportive fluids, Cerenia injection etc). 

Both vets just have different approaches to the same problem as your dog doesn’t appear to be critical, which would narrow your options.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1gcvxj0/dog_ate_tampons_conflicting_advice_from_vets/#ltydjuk,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Need advice from people who can help me navigate an emotionally confusing situation.. I never thought I’d be looking forward to losing my dog.
TLDR: my dog is becoming increasingly restless and vocal in her old age and I can’t find peace in my own home. She’s physically doing well for her age but I’m having a hard time determining her mental quality of life. 

I want to start by saying I love my dog deeply. She was my first dog. I asked my parents for a dog ever since I could talk - whenever they’d ask what I want for my birthday or Christmas they would quickly follow up with “other than a dog…” because it was all I wanted in the whole world. I knew I was a dog person even though I’d never had one of my own. Finally, when I was in middle school, we took a family trip to the local shelter and I picked out a terrified little 5 month old pit/hound mix puppy. And now 14 years later, she’s still here. I was in a dark mental state throughout high school and college, and she was my rock. I knew no matter what, I could go home at the end of the day and she’d be there, my constant companion and best friend.  We’ve been on a lot of fun adventures together over the years, too. I just want you guys to have some context and know that this dog has a very special place in my heart and I really do love her. 

She still gets around pretty well for her age, every once in a while slipping on the hardwood (we do put out rugs and yoga mats for her but sometimes she chooses not to use them), missing a step on the stairs, or needing help to get on the couch, but overall she gets around so well that people don’t believe me when I tell them she’s 14. She’s had a few medical issues in her old age: aspiration pneumonia twice because she has pharyngeal paresis (difficulty swallowing), a vestibular episode which left her with a little head tilt even after recovery, environmental allergies, a few random sketchy skin masses that were surgically removed, arthritis, spinal bone spurs, moderate doggy dementia, and this newly developed neurological issue where her whole body gets rigid for like 1-2 seconds and she seems to zone out, but then she snaps right out of it and never loses consciousness or falls or anything (her vets don’t know what’s up with that, it’s only been going on for the last couple months). She’s on Carprofen, Gabapentin, Zyrtec, Apoquel, and Melatonin, and gets regular bloodwork. She still brings me toys to play tug with her, she has a spot in the yard that she loves to dig in, and she happily chews on her Nyla bones, but those activities only make up about 15-20 minutes of her day, total. 

So here’s where I question some of her quality of life: when she’s not doing any of the things enjoys, she doesn’t seem to know what to do with herself. Her adult life she was always very independent, no separation anxiety, kept herself busy, etc. but now she just can’t seem to settle down. She whines all the time. We offer her food, water, outside, plush toy, chew toy, play tug, to cuddle on the couch with us, butt scritches, and essentially exhaust everything she could be whining about to no avail. I wish so deeply that she could communicate with us. She also wants to go outside and back inside over and over again, even if we are present. For example, the weather will be perfect so I’ll go outside to sit on the deck. She’ll want to go outside with me and will lay down on the deck for a few minutes then get up and go to the back door and bark (and I mean when she barks, she BARKS). I’ve tried for years to be like “no ma’am, let’s stay outside, come over here and lay down” but she is incredibly stubborn and demanding so these days I just open the door so she can go inside. I go and sit back down outside. A minute later, she’s barking at the back door. I let her come back outside with me. Within a minute, she’s barking to go back inside. And sometimes I think, maybe she just wants me to go inside *with her*… so I ditch the pretty day and go back inside. But she’s still not happy. She’s pacing and whining and barking to do the inside/outside thing all over again. It’s exhausting and it is a constant issue. 

Every day, all day long, she won’t settle and she barks so loudly that it’s impossible to ignore. And she will not stop until you do something for her (literally I’ve been trying to sleep off migraines, taking a shower, mowing the yard, and no matter how long my activity is, she will continue barking until I pay attention to her) and if I can’t figure out what she wants (which is usually the case) I have to hard-core encourage her to go lie down, patting her bed or the couch and repeating “come here and lie down! Come on, come lie down!”. And this has been for at least the last 3-ish years of her life, and only getting worse. I just know that when she’s gone, I’ll actually have peace in my home. I’ll be able to sit outside, watch a movie, make a meal, literally whatever I want or need to do without having to stop every few minutes to try to appease her or beg her settle down. 

So, I’m sure I’m being selfish, but I never in a million years thought I’d feel this way about her and I hate it. Whenever I do think about the fact that she won’t be around forever, and that I’ve had her for literally half my life, I try to really love on her and see the good dog in her and I do get emotional - but I’ve found that all I’m doing is reminiscing on the dog she used to be. I already am mourning for her, because I feel like I’ve already lost the real her. 

Part of my guilt is that I’m a licensed vet tech. I’ve seen SO many people lose their old dogs. For some of them, its quick/unexpected and little or no decision to put them down was involved. For others, their dog is still mentally there, but their body is failing them. Some people keep their dog alive for longer than they probably should because they just don’t want to let go. I thought my knowledge and experience would make it a more black and white decision for me. My dog is physically okay (far from perfect, but has manageable issues) but mentally I just truly don’t know. I’ve tried anxiety meds to help her settle but they haven’t worked and one just made her restlessness worse. Is she happy? I wish I knew. Am I just waiting for something bad to happen medically so that I can finally say it was her time and not have to feel guilty for having these feelings anymore? Maybe I am. Or maybe I’ll just feel even more guilty when she’s gone. 

Anyway, this was a really difficult and emotional post to write and if you actually read it all then thank you. I just really would appreciate advice from veterinary professionals who don’t know me or my dog personally.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13t7472/need_advice_from_people_who_can_help_me_navigate/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"One time I had this job and my boss always brought her dogs into the office. She had adopted a Great Pyrenees as a puppy, but he had something wrong with one of his legs. The vet said they had to wait til he was done growing to fix it. When the time came, they did the surgery. And the dog had to be locked inside a crate for four weeks, for 24 hours a day. A crate that was sized so he could not stand on the leg, in order to get the leg to heal. He could only come out for walks which happened thru the use of a special sling. 

For an entire month I sat in the office with this poor dog in this crate. The dog just sat there. Never made a peep. It slept a lot, but mostly just stared around. 

I thought to myself, is this the right thing to do? Because the dog doesn't know the details of what's going on. It just knows that these people are forcing it to lie in a crate for weeks. 

The surgery didn't take and they had to amputate his leg anyway. 

My point is, just because there are life extension or quality of life improvement options with a risk, it doesn't make us selfish for opting to forego them. In fact, sometimes one might believe the opposite to be true, that it's actually more selfish to try to keep extending the dogs life just because you can. 

It's not selfish of you to want to end the dogs life. It wouldn't have been selfish of you to have done it three-ish years ago, either.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13t7472/need_advice_from_people_who_can_help_me_navigate/#jlv5eat,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Hi, I am really sorry to hear about your situation and the first thing I would like to say is that, at the currently moment your dog is not happy. It is not normal for her to be barking and restless, and although there was no clear underlying cause, I think it is important to ask some questions before proceeding with advice. How does your dog do when changing environments? If you take her for a walk or to visit a friend, does the behaviour continues? One thing I am thinking about is stereotypical behaviour, but need more info. You mention you tried several kinds of distractions/interactions, but I would like to know about her going to different environments. One thing to say, as I am sure you know, is that there is no shame or guilty on opting for euthanasia if no solutions can be found in a timely manner. It is one of the big advantages of the veterinary field to be able to shortening suffering for patients and their families. Just think about an elderly person in a vegetative state without any chance to recover: this brings so much suffering for the family, even though the patient is not necessarily suffering. In your case, at the moment, it is very likely that your dog is not happy. I am really sorry for your situation and I hope a change of environment sparks some  indication that another solution is possible. If not, as much as it hurts, you know euthanasia is a humane solution, and there is nothing selfish about it.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13t7472/need_advice_from_people_who_can_help_me_navigate/#jltzo7x,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Last fall my 14 year old dog was maybe a little worse off than yours and we made the decision to let her go. Her dementia had progressed to the point where she would wander the house all night and started snapping at the cat who had always been her best friend 

She also had pharyngeal paresis, arthritis skin masses (cancerous but slow growing) and took a handful of meds twice a day 

She had gotten to the point where she would no longer take her meds peacefully by any method that had worked and it was causing her to lose trust in me. 

Our vet, who had just been through the same progression with her own dog told us to consider her relationship with us and our quality of life (someone had to stay up with her overnight) as well as her pain and mental state.

It was an agonizing decision, we got her a burger and fries on the way and the vet had a Reese's peanut butter cup and a snack sized Snickers for her. We all sat and cried while she gave the injections but that moment right before she passed she finally relaxed for the first time in over a year and we knew it was the right choice at the right time.

We only JUST moved her bed out as the cats all still liked to roll around in her scent and we kept a few of her favorite toys for them",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13t7472/need_advice_from_people_who_can_help_me_navigate/#jlupuk2,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Should I Get My 2-Year-Old Golden Retriever Neutered? Seeking Advice
Hey everyone,

I’m considering neutering my 2-year-old male Golden Retriever and would love to hear some opinions, especially from those with experience or professional knowledge.

He’s a well-behaved dog, has gone through basic obedience training, and is currently working with a prong collar for minor reactivity issues. While he’s generally great, he does get overly excited around females in heat, which can sometimes be challenging. Also, when using the prong collar, he tends to pull into it rather than responding to the correction.

After doing extensive research, I’ve learned that certain hormones play a crucial role in a dog’s development, and I want to make sure I make the best decision for his health and behavior. Given my situation, I’d appreciate any professional insights or guidance from those who have been in a similar position.

"Cat Insurance Advice
So I have two cats and I want to get pet insurance for them. I need a little advice on which insurance would be best given that they both have different levels of preexisting conditions.

Corduroy: 1 Year-Old Cornish Rex. He has a teary eye due to a congenital defect with his tearduct. Veterinary ophthalmologist confirmed that this is cosmetic only.

What are my pet insurance options here? I want to get decent coverage without breaking the bank because accidents happen, illness is inevitable, and animals eat things they're not supposed to. I put it off for a time because they kept having minor illnesses pop up. Namely getting Minky's allergies under control and identifying the reason for Corduoy's teary eye.

Hi there, i'll make this as short and with as much info as i can!

  
My male cat (*British shorthair, 11+ years old*) Fell somehow yesterday, i wasn't in the room i just heard the fall.   
I found him at the bottom of the stairs crying with a bleeding nose, He bled less than 1ml of blood within a 2 minute timeframe, and was really frightened so i put him in my room and left him (*my rooms his safe space!*). Today he doesn't seem to want to walk, he is purring, being affectionate and can walk (*when i made food for him he walked through the kitchen!*) But other than that he's stayed in the same position on my bed for 6+ hours, Even when i lift him up, he'll not even put weight on his backlegs, just flops back onto his side

"My cat ate and threw up a grape and I need advice
My year old cat ate and threw up a grape about 2 days ago. According to google, grapes are very poisonous to cats and even one can cause kidney failure and lead to death. The thrown up grape didn’t look too digested, it looked chewed up and covered with a clear liquid. I don’t know how long he had the grape in his body as I didn’t see him eat it, I had only found it. I have noticed him drinking a lot more water, and randomly meowing. Drinking more water is a sign of kidney failure according to google, and I think he might be meowing in discomfort. Last night he was gagging like he wanted to throw up but he hasn’t thrown up. He hasn’t thrown up since he threw up the grape. He seems a bit more tired than usual, although not by much, he still swats at toys I wave around and wants to go outside. And other than what I just described he seems fine, he still eats, drinks, poops normal poop, wants to go outside, and I haven’t noticed a random discomfort meow in the past day or so.

Money is extremely tight and I need to know if I should take my cat to the vet to run those expensive tests or will he be fine based on what I’ve described

Update: I am currently at an emergency vet clinic waiting for my cat to be called and treated

Update#2: The bloodworks test would’ve been around 300 dollars. That’s not mentioning the treatment.

I have no doubt that they will recommend (rightly so) a blood panel to check his kidney function, and maybe iv fluids with an overnight stay. If you absolutely are unwilling to utilize a vet, get him to drink as many fluids as possible, but know that to save money now, you are potentially looking at more expenses later if it causes lasting damage.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1f44any/my_cat_ate_and_threw_up_a_grape_and_i_need_advice/#lkiv7k3,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"We see you have mentioned grapes and/or raisins. If your dog has ingested or potentially ingested either, you should contact Animal Poison Control and start heading to the nearest open Vets office.

Grapes/Raisins are poisonous to dogs and can cause kidney failure or death. The reaction is idiosyncratic meaning different dogs react differently. There is no known safe or poisonous amount and as few as 4-5 grapes have been implicated in the death of a dog.

The underlying mechanism for grape toxicity is believed to be tartaric acid. As tartaric acid can very significantly from grape to grape and between types of grapes, this may explain why reactions are idiosyncratic. Research is ongoing.

We advise that you do not rely on online toxicity calculators as those assume a non-idiosyncratic reaction and extrapolate assuming dog size x vs grape count y, and the data does not support that sort of relationship at this time.

"Need advice ASAP!!!
My cat (9month old) recently got spayed Tuesday Feb 25th. Everything looked fine at first but for the last 2 days a clear/ pinkish liquid has started to leak out of her incision. I think it might be a possible infection but hell if I know. Last night, March 1st, we had to take her to an emergency vet clinic where they said she looks perfectly fine and that her incision looks like it could get infected but hasn’t yet and then they gave her some antibiotic shot, they also said there's nothing to worry abt. This morning tho her incision looks like it's opened up. (And again I still think her incision might be infected or is getting there.) Weird thing is that she has no changes in her behavior, eating habits, or bowel movements. She's acting like she's perfectly fine. Maybe a lil depressed cuz we put a cone in her head and we’re keeping her in the bathroom so she doesn’t jump up on high places around the apartment. I'm just really freaking out cuz idk what to do! I've done my best patting the area dry and trying to keep it clean without making the incision wet/damp. Any and all advice would be appreciated!!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j23hje/need_advice_asap/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Advice on preventing fleas?
I've got a dog and five cats. The dog goes out in a yard that I've seen rabbits, stray cats, and deer running through. I've dealt with fleas and worms twice now, so this time, on a day the snow was starting to melt (cold where I live), I treated all of them with Frontline (the one that goes on the back of their necks). I've also got a spray for furniture that I use. 

However, I've done these things last year around the same time, and they still ended up with fleas that went on for months. It wasn't as bad as the first time they had it, but one cat still ended up with butt worms. I really don't want that to happen again, so I was wondering if any professionals had advice for prevention? ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j2i9z3/advice_on_preventing_fleas/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Make sure you're using prevention consistently and appropriately (I.e. topicals need to actually reach the skin on the back of the neck to work). There are some studies that suggest that the major for product failure is inappropriate application. You can ask your vet to demo application for you.

There have been reports of fipronil (the active ingredient in frontline) resistance in fleas as well. It's unclear how much this actually contributes to product failure, anecdotally it's often blamed although some experts in the field suggest it's not as widespread as product failures would suggest and therefore don't think it's as big of an issue as inconsistent use and inappropriate application.

You could try an oral flea preventative (Nexgard, simparica/trio, etc for dogs and Credelio for cats) since that takes application issues out of the equation. Isoxazolines also have a better spectrum of activity against ticks and no reports of resistance. Sentinel (lufenuron/praziquantel/milbemycin) for dogs also prevents fleas (and heartworm and GI parasites) as an oral but doesn't cover ticks.

Or you could try a different drug class for topicals if you've got a dog that hates orals or a cat that.. well.. acts like a cat.

"My Vet Prescribed My Cat Metacam and I am Concerned Looking For Advice
Hello, my new vet (found out my old vet was wayyy over charging me) has prescribed my spayed Tuxedo cat (estimated 3 years old, but exact age unknown) four days of 0.1 mL daily of Metacam (my cat Junie is roughly 8.5 pounds for weight reference) because she sprained a muscle in her leg. I was given a pouch with the oral syringes, but no box. When I looked up the medicine I am seeing that this can cause renal failure and death and is not FDA approved (in this formula) for use in cats. I was not told about this at all at the vet, nor was I informed that there is a black box message on the normal packaging. Junie was a street cat, so we don't know too much about her history. Everything I have read says that the vets should run a blood panel prior to prescription which did not happen. I adore this kitty very much and have no clue what I would do if she wasn't in this world. I am asking if it would be safe for me not to give Junie the final two doses (everything I had read says that this should only be used in short time periods maximum 48-72 hours) or should I carry out her prescription? Of course I don't want her to be in pain, but I am concerned that this could really hurt her. Please be kind, I am a new pet parent and just want the best and safest care for Junie B.

  
Edit: I have never posted on this subreddit before and based on the moderator comment I understand that you aren't allowed to give me instructions on medicines and dosages. I am asking instead just for an overall understanding of the safety of this medicine given the information above.

,"Not a vet (human doctor if it matters) but your cat was likely prescribed the canine version vs feline version of metacam (meloxicam) which is virtually the same from my understanding but the concentration in the canine version is higher.   


Feline is 0.5mg/mL 

Canine is 1.5mg/mL 


Your Veterinarian would have calculated the dose your cat needs by weight and 0.1mL would be 0.15mg which would be the correct dose for the animal and with the feline version you would need to administer 3x the amount for the same potency.  


Renal failure caused by NSAID medications like metacam is rare when the medication is only administered for a short period of time and I wouldn't worry too much just be sure to administer the cat the correct prescribed dose per the dosing instructions on the label (example: 0.1ml every 24 hours)

"Need end of life advice for my 15 year old best friend 
Before I ask my question, let me tell you about Roxie. 

This dog has been through the trenches with me. She once was a 50lb meat head who would wiggle into million little pieces if she even got an inkling that we might be going for a walk. She ran a half marathon when she was 8 years old. I ran a half marathon because of her. She loved to pull me and my friends around Boston on a long board, just for a lark. She was twice victorious in her battles against the Allston rats. She thoroughly enjoyed a dip in the Charles River on a sunny day after a long walk. She is quite literally the softest dog you've ever pet, a trait that comes in handy since her absolute #1 all time favorite activity is getting any human affection at all. All you have to do is touch her and she melts into a cuddle puddle.

With all that being said, here is my question --

She is old. She's 15. She's been declining for a couple years now (we stopped running together when she turned 12) but a few days ago she had an accident and hurt her back while I was in Seattle visiting family. My husband took her to our vet who said it was a slipped disc that could be healed with lots of rest (sedatives and pain killers and muscle relaxers). Combined with some other quality of life factors that were already having an impact, we're not really sure this is a journey she'll be coming back from.

Our vet gave us trazodone to sedate her so she can heal. We think it's time for euthanasia but hate the idea of her laying on stainless steel. Could we give her extra trazodone and just let her fall into The Big Sleep at home?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1bo2r6a/need_end_of_life_advice_for_my_15_year_old_best/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Behavioral euthanasia for aggressive cat 
This situation is emotionally and physically exhausting, please read with kindness and without judgement. 

I feel as if I’m in an impossible situation, and have been recommended behavioral euthanasia for my aggressive cat. 

Background:
My cat is 4 years old and started displaying aggressive behavior 1.5 years ago. He has attacked his cat sister at least 5 times (sister cat does not instigate and is afraid of aggressive cat) and has attacked me at least 8 times, hissing spitting clawing biting, drawing blood and requiring urgent care trips and antibiotics. When he is not aggressive, he is easily spooked and very suspicious at home, he looks at me like he doesn’t recognize me creeps around the house. Before the aggression started, he was the most loving, cuddly, friendly cat I have ever owned. 

I have done everything recommended to me by professionals. Daily fluoxetine (the highest dose), Feliway plug ins, behavioral management, medical assessments, consulting a cat specialist behavioralist, etc. 

The behavior specialist is dumbfounded by what is causing my cats aggression. There seems to be no apparent pattern or trigger and is very unpredictable. She spent 2.5 hours with me at my house and my two cats. My cat has lost about 1.25 pounds and the behaviorist shared that my cat looks 14, not 4. She is concerned about a medical issue and referred me to an internal specialist for a CT scan, costing about 2-3k. 

I am at a complete loss of what to do next and it seems like everything points to behavioral euthanasia. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1f1xsed/behavioral_euthanasia_for_aggressive_cat/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Behavioral Euthanasia for cat
I made a post last night about my violent cat. We have a vet appointment tomorrow but after nearly 24 hours of straight aggression I’m considering doing what I believe the humane thing would be. 

Now before anyone says anything please let me explain and I’m happy to receive constructive feedback.

I’ve had my (4 year old) female cat since 6 weeks old. Ever since getting her she has been violent. I initially let some of her behavior slide as she was a kitten but clearly she never grew out of this behavior. By a year old she had attacked me 3-4 times if not more over peeing on my bed/random events. These weren’t just small scratches. She would explode, bushy tail big eyes, screaming and spitting. I took her to the vet multiple times only to be told this was behavioral. 

Now in the past 4 years I’ve been attacked more times than I can count. She’s tried attacking every roommate I’ve had, most people that come over and my other cat. I personally have been the only one mauled enough to the point of blood and scars. Never had to go to the ER but horrible enough that I’m physically scared on multiple parts of my body. 

Again I’ve been to the vet after each incident. Never once receiving medication for the behavior. I was told she has crystals in her urine and that a wet food diet will fix this. I made the switch and didn’t see a change. 

Last night was probably one of the worst attacks in awhile. I take a lot of blame as our apartment has been extremely stressful for the past month. See my last post. 

24 hours later I let her out of my room and she’s still hissing and spitting at me. I’m scared to even get her into her crate to be seen by the vet. I have a TNR trap I’m going to use but probably will stress her out further. 

Our vet appointment for tomorrow is with a new vet. I’m hoping for answers but I’m emotionally scarred from this. I would consider rehoming or even giving her up to a rescue but I live in NYC and we are packed to the brim with shelter cats. I also don’t feel comfortable giving her up in this condition. 

Maybe I’m crazy but this seems like a genetic issue paired with possible kidney issues and I hate saying it but I can’t go on like this. Between my own health issues this environment isn’t conducive for either of us. I love her so dearly but again she’s in pain and so am I.

,"I would definitely consider a vet specialised in cat behaviour before considering euthanasia. They can often provide a much more helpful pov, diagnosis and treatment plan than a regular vet (in these cases obviously). Often it's possible to see noticeable improvement in the short to mid term. They will probably prescribe anxiety meds (such as gabapentin) and a lot of structured exercises to help with behavioural issues.

Edit: The fact that you have never been prescribed meds for your cat's behavioural issues is yet another important reason why you may want to consider a second opinion from a vet specialised in cat behaviour.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1efjdtl/behavioral_euthanasia_for_cat/#lfmifwy,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m asking these questions so you can really ponder if euthanasia is really the only way out. It’s quite unfair to take away your 4-year-old cat’s life for something like this, even if right now you both are not living well.

"Dog's behavior has drastically changed since being on Prednisone 
My dog has been taking Prednisone for about 6 months now to treat severe skin issues that were causing her to get reoccurring skin infections and yeast infections, lose hair, and itch nonstop. Nothing but the Prednisone has helped, and we've tried everything else available to treat issues like these, and it has made a big difference, her skin is completely better. 
The problem is her behavior has completely changed to the point I don't even recognize her as my dog anymore, and I don't know if this is normal or if there's anything I can do to help her. 
She was formerly a very calm, laid back and sweet dog that was pretty well trained and listened to us. Now she's neurotic, constantly pacing and constantly right underneath my feet staring at me to the point I struggle to be able to do literally anything in the house without tripping over an 80 lb pitbull mix, she doesn't listen anymore, she doesn't come to me when I call her anymore and acts like a total idiot at feeding time, it's like she's forgotten the years of training I've done with her. And it's not her hearing, as far as we know she can hear absolutely fine she just ignores us for some reason now. 
If I didn't know better I would say she was possessed by the spirit of a different dog because she doesn't act like herself at all anymore. And I feel really bad saying it, but the new version of her is really annoying and poorly behaved and idk what to do about it.
Could it be the medication causing all of this? Because she was fine and herself before starting it. 
I miss my sweet girl and I want her back. 

Edit: welp half the responses have been deleted so that's completely not helpful. I tried posting this on another sub and it was immediately deleted from there. Can anybody suggest a sub I might actually be allowed to get answers about this in without mods on a power trip deleting everything lol?

My BF's 8 year old spayed female bull mastiff has been escaping lately. It is a new behavior, she has gotten out three times in the last week. First, she was sniffing around the garage but today she was down the road on the neighbor's property. 

We believe that she has arthritis because she limps. She also has accidents where she sleeps. She's been depressed since BF's grand-ma, who he lived with, passed.

BF has been having people over to socialize her. He also makes it a point to cuddle her daily. He massages her aswell. There's another dog in the house who she gets along with.

"Weird behavior after neutering
My cat just got his neutering surgery today and I’ve been a bit worried since I picked him up from the vet. Apparently he peed himself after the surgery and even after the anesthesia went away completely some hours ago he falls every time he tries to walk (maybe because of his d-collar). 
At first he was super clingy and acting like a baby, but now that the anesthesia went away and I wanted to go to sleep with him (he sleeps in my bed) he tried to bite my face. That scared me a lot and had to call my bf so he sleeps in the living room with my cat because I am exhausted and really need to sleep… 

Is this behavior normal? I’ve heard that some cats become aggressive after neutering but I just wanted to hear from others… my vet gave me 2 medicines, one every 24 hours and other every 12, the doses will start tomorrow too. Also, how can I make him feel more comfortable? I’ve tried giving him his comfort bedsheets but he gets frustrated and more aggressive because he can’t suck it like he usually does because of the e-collar… is there anything I can do to make him feel better? I don’t want my kitty to feel discomfort :( 
(He has also been trying to jump a lot, and has already done a bit… he jumps in the tables and kitchen counters and I know he isn’t supposed to do so… so how can I minimize this behavior in him? I don’t want him to get hurt bc of his surgery) ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1is4p4p/weird_behavior_after_neutering/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Sudden Behavioral Change
Hi, I am located in New England, USA with my 2 female cats ages 6 and 3, unknown breed, the older one is spayed and the younger one is not as she did not weigh enough at the time. The older one is the mother to the younger one although I adopted the mother a couple months after the younger one. When reintroducing them they did not like each other and had a few fights but with time they started to get along. I noticed some tension between them around their food(when one was eating the other would watch from across the room and eat out of the same bowl right after they walked away) so I separated it hoping to resolve the issue but the issue still persisted. The younger one has weight about 3.5 lbs for as long as they’ve known eachother and the older one has plumped right up. Now within the last month the younger one has become aggressive around the older one, so much so that they can’t even be around eachother. I feel like separating them makes the problem worse because they like being separate, but they need to learn to live together again, so today one of them is in the main living space in a dog kennel and I’ve been switching them out every hour so they can use the bathroom and eat/drink without issues, I’m hoping that since they have to be around eachother still yet can’t fight it might help but seeing them in there just makes me so sad. I’m not sure if getting the younger one fixed would solve the problem or not, but I’m nervous given her weight. Does anyone have any recommendations on what I can do at home to try and get them used to eachother without them trying to rip the others throat apart? And would getting her fixed help? TYIA

ETA: I did bring the younger one to the vet to make sure nothing was physically wrong with her to cause her behavior and they told me she looked fine. They wouldn’t tell me whether or not they thought fixing her would work, just if I wanted to do it they could schedule me.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j8bewu/sudden_behavioral_change/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Manic licking of former bandaged paw and aggressive behavior
I am coming to you out of desperation with our beloved dog amy. I am trying to compress a long story as much as possible:

We have a female mixed breed rescue dog, weighing just about 10kg (22lbs). She is neutered and has been living with us for 4.5 years now. Up until now we had no behavioral issues and she integrated very well in our daily lives. The household consists of two adults, no kids, no other pets. No Medication or known issues.

Unfortunately on 2nd January 2025 she had an accident were a heavy object fell on her paw and injured it. She suffered a small fracture on a toe and has an open wound between two toes. We immediately went to a veterinary clinic. There she was x-rayed and examined. The fracture was seen as a minor issue that should heal on its own (this was later confirmed by an orthopedic surgeon), the cut was the more severe problem. The wound was cleaned and the foot was bandaged, no stitches were applied. The bandages were changed daily. She used the foot normally after that, no change in behavior was seen by us, we did only very short walks (about 3x 10 minutes/day).

A week later the wound was examined again under sedation since she showed new signs of pain and was then stitched up. Pain medication was increased.

The (multiple) vets we saw say that the foot slowly needs to come out of the bandage for the wound to heal properly. Unfortunately amy starts to manically lick the paw as soon as she has any access to it. Muzzles or cones did not help (she is trained on both) and she reacts with unseen aggression to any attempt to stop her from licking. She growls loudly and snaps at my hands if i come close to the paw when she is licking it. Only getting her bandaged again at the vet stopped that behaviour.

We are now desperately looking for any insights or experience on how to keep a dog from licking the paw after it, this is our guess, now seems like a foreign object since it changed in smell and feel under the bandage. Especially when cones or muzzles are no option because she fights them violently.

All of this happened under close supervision of multiple vets, we are very certain that there are no other issues with the paw other then the aforementioned.

Thanks for any insights or ideas. We will of course talk with the vet before we apply anything on our own.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1i2krvv/manic_licking_of_former_bandaged_paw_and/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Cat food behavior?
Hey there, I’m completely new here and hoping to just get a general idea of what I could be dealing with. I did read the rules, and I know you guys can’t 100% confidently give a diagnosis, but I’m hoping someone could give some idea of what could be going on for my cat. 

He is a 6 year old male cat, neutered and declawed. He is up to date on his shots, I have had him since he was ready to leave his mom. He currently is not on a heart worm medication or any medication in general. He is a mix of a Maine Coon & American Shorthair (so physically big like a Maine coon (like his father), but has the hair/fur structure of a shorthair (like his mother)). Unfortunately I don’t know how much he currently weights as this is part of why I am asking here. He is a 100% indoor cat, and the only cat in the household. 

A couple of days before Thursday 2/20 I noticed that my cat had stopped eating his food, and he was really skinny. At this point I could feel his bones, and when I look down at him you could see outline of hip. He has always been an active cat playing with his toys and has always been on the lean side but this was way thinner than normal. At this time, he had a food brand called “Nature’s Promise” for indoor cats. I gave him one of those wet treats (I believe it was “temptation” brand?) to which he wolfed it down like he was starved. This lead me to believe that he didn’t like his food so I switched his food out for Purina Complete (blue bag) and he immediately started chowing down. 

Then within a day or 2 he stopped eating that, he would go over to his food bowl & smell the food and then walk away after. I thought that he didn’t like the food so I got him a different brand, this time Blue Buffalo Salmon flavored for adult cats as I knew he had eaten this in the past and liked this. 

This worked for like 2 days and then on Thursday 2/20 he didn’t eat that morning, and he was straining to have a bowel movement, and was throwing up bile. This happened all within an hour. He went to his litter box, strained, hopped out, a minute or so later was throwing up bile, went back to his litter box & had a small bowel movement. Hopped out, just to throw up again in the livingroom and then strained to have a bowel movement in the livingroom. In between all of this he was howling like he was in pain & uncomfortable. I rushed him to the ER. 

The vets there said he was stable, they couldn’t feel any obstructions when they did a basic examination. They suggested to do blood work & xray, but I don’t have the funds to drop $1,000+. Regardless they were able to give him some fluids, and they prescribed him to take 60ml of Lactulose every 8 hrs to help him pass a bowel movement. 

This did help him, and he is able to pass a bowel movement (and urinate properly). My concern is he still is not eating properly, he still goes to his food bowl, smells the food and then walks away. I currently have 2 different food brands out for him; Blue Buffalo that I mentioned before & Fancy feast salmon & fish. I refresh his water bowl every day to much sure it’s fresh for him. He is also still throwing up bile every once in a while, like once every 4 to 5 days. 

I got him temptation treats (solid) and he will eat those, but I know this isn’t the healthiest option for him as that’s the equivalent of feeding a kid candy for every meal. He refuses to eat wet food, has never liked it through his life. He doesn’t even like tuna that we get in a can, doesn’t like chicken either. 

Any advice would be huge, if this post violates any of the rules, I am sorry. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j6q4si/cat_food_behavior/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Territorial behavior in new cat
I'm not sure if this is a vet question but I figured I'd try. We adopted a 6 year old stray cat a few months ago. He immediately warmed up to our other cats but he’s quite fearful of our dog. We’ve made a lot of progress and he lets the dog get a lot closer to him than before. The problem is that in order to do a slow introduction we put the cat in a separate room and didn’t allow the dog in there. Now if we let the cat out of the room he doesn’t hiss at the dog. But if the cat is in the room and the dog wants to come in he still hisses, spits, and lunges. To me this seems like pretty extreme territorial behavior because it's so different from the way he behaves outside of ""his"" room. Any advice on how to teach our cat that the room isn’t solely his?

"Sudden Mystery Behavior Change
Hi! So our vets are stumps and I figured it might be worth a shot to ask here. My family dog is an almost 7 yo female Great Dane. Around 6 months ago, she started acting like she is constantly hungry. She has started breaking into the trash can for food, jumping onto the counter and stealing food, constantly standing at the cabinet to ask for treats etc. This is never something she has done before, in fact, she really would even beg! 

This morning, she ate 4 large blueberry muffins and an entire loaf of sourdough bread that were sitting in the counter wrapped up. She completely tore open the packaging. Another example is when I had 2 boxes of uncooked rice sitting on the floor in a grocery bag and she tore open the cardboard box and tried to start eating it. 

She has been to the vet and gotten a bleed test for thyroid, Cushings, and another condition that can cause excessive hunger I don’t remember the name. Every test came back completely normal and healthy except for her liver enzyme which she is now on medication for. However, the vet said this should not cause these symptoms. Does anyone have any ideas on what this might be or what we can test for? 

Other symptoms such as weight loss can be explained by the liver enzyme, we haven’t noticed anything else out of the ordinary beside an increase in eating grass (typically after she gets into human food though). 

She has been on the same brand of food since she graduated from puppy food. I’m waiting for my family to tell me the kibble brand, but she gets it twice a day with fish oil and some chicken in it. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1iuzd8t/sudden_mystery_behavior_change/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Rescue dog - new behavior
I rescued a dog about six weeks ago. She’s been settling in pretty well so far. However, she started doggy daycare last week, and since then, she’s been more fearful in my home. She will often go hide in my room (that’s her “safe place”) and tremble. Also, about two weeks ago, she had a vet check up. The vet prescribed gabapentin and trazadone for her nightmares (as they were occurring 2-3 times per night, every single night and she was freaking out). I recognize that she has not fully settled in yet, but she used to follow me around and play in my home. Is she over stimulated from doggy daycare? Is the medication effecting her negatively? Or is my house just not as fun as doggy daycare? I just don’t want to be missing something more serious. If it’s as simple as giving her space, I’m happy to do that.

"Behavioral adjustment
Looking for some advice. We recently rescued two 9 moth old female cats- bonded pair but not siblings.  They're doing great!  However, we have recently noticed that one be a bit of a bully when it comes to food and water, particularly when the other is trying to eat or drink. She also loves to play in the water and makes a total mess around the water dish.  The other cat has been a bit lethargic and we're worried that perhaps she's not getting enough to eat/drink. 

Do you have any tips or tricks to try and curb this behavior? I've set up a second food/water station but if the bully sees th either there, she still bothers her. Maybe they're just settling in and this is normal? I've never had two cats before!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j5az12/behavioral_adjustment/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Can a dog mistake one person for another? Seeking advice on a complex situation involving grief and behavioral changes.
Hi everyone,  
I’m looking for advice or insights from dog behaviorists, trainers, or anyone who might have experienced something similar. Here’s the situation:

My wife and I inherited a dog from her late father, who passed away from cancer. The dog was in temporary care for about 3-4 months before we brought him home. When my wife went to pick him up, she was accompanied by my stepfather, let’s call him Dave. Dave and the dog had never met before, but when the dog saw Dave from a distance, he seemed to run toward him excitedly, as if he recognized him.

Since then, Dave and my mom have visited us occasionally, and the dog always gets very excited when Dave arrives. However, after a recent visit to their house for a family gathering, the dog’s behavior changed dramatically:

* He became much more anxious.
* He started showing severe separation anxiety (e.g., chewing things, refusing to eat).
* He seemed distressed when left alone, which wasn’t an issue before.

Additionally, there are a few peculiar details:

1. Recently, the dog froze during a walk when he saw a white Ford van (similar to the one his late owner had). He refused to move for a while, even though we were close to home.
2. Dave also has cancer (in remission), and I wonder if the dog could be picking up on something related to medications or the illness itself.

**My question is:** Could the dog be mistaking Dave for his late owner? And if so, could this be causing his anxiety and behavioral changes? Could the dog be confused or grieving, thinking, “Why isn’t my old owner taking me back?”

I’d really appreciate any insights, especially from professionals or people who’ve dealt with similar situations. Thank you so much in advance!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j4gwkt/can_a_dog_mistake_one_person_for_another_seeking/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Odd Cat Behavior & Stomatitis
For reference, my cat is 11 1/2. I got her just two months ago, and I had never owned cats before. I took her to the vet for the first time a few weeks ago, and I let the vet know she wasn’t eating well and often looked like her teeth were in pain. After looking in her mouth, the vet diagnosed her with stomatitis. She is getting her molars removed to help ease the pain on March 17th. 

Since then, though, her symptoms have been getting worse and I’m nervous it might be worse than stomatitis. When I first brought her home, she ate dry food and wet food. When her teeth started bothering her she stopped eating dry food. Recently, she’s also stopped eating wet food. I’ve tried switching up flavors and it hasn’t worked. She drinks water from my dirty dishes in the sink (although she has her own water bowl) and will occasionally eat some calming treats I give her. I’m really worried about her eating habits. She’s already smaller than she should be (6 lbs) and I don’t think it’s good for her to lose weight. 

When it comes to the litter box, she’s good at going to the litter box. Since I’ve had her, she’s had trouble squatting. Sometimes the pee would go straight to the wall instead of in the litter. I got a covered litter box and she’s been using it. Today was the first time I saw her pee not in her litter box. She was no where near it, but she was not urgently looking for somewhere to pee. 

She’s just as clingy as ever, which is a good sign I think, but she’s a wee bit moodier than normal. I think I just need some validation that everything will be alright if I’m proactive. Like I said, she’s my first cat. She’s also my first pet of my own, not a family pet. I care a lot about her. Are these normal stomatitis symptoms? Should they get better when her teeth get removed?

"Aggressive behavior
My dog (female, 1 1/2 years old) has always been the playful, sassy, loving puppy, we play tug of war and fetch. But we would also do little play fights and she bites(just my arms) gentle so I don’t get hurt(reasoning is because when ever she did bite too hard she noticed before I did)…. But idk anymore because our nabors got a new dog recently and the only thing separating our 3 dogs and there 2 is a chain link fence. She has never tried to hurt there other dog but I’m assuming that’s because they are siblings from the same pack raised together. And she hasn’t tried to hurt any of our out her dogs eyther. But recently we noticed that our cat Momo was trying to snuggle her and she attacked him, this happens one more time after(hasn’t don’t it again) but it was weird because she never acted that way before. 

Now today I let her and one of our other dogs out to play and our nabor let there out shortly after, I heard them barking through the fence at eatchother through the fence. I looked out my window to see my dog snarling here teeth towards out nabors new dog. I went outside to try and see if I could fix the issue. I was standing at the fence with our other dog(we will call him tank). Our nabors new dog(we will call him taco) was standing on the other side of the fence and would NOT stop barking. Tank walked away and Taco tried to pee on the fence. Right as he lifted his leg both Tank and my dog start running toward the fence. Tank was just barking, but my dog once she got up to the fence bared her teeth and attacked Tank(just snaps no actual physical contact) then stuffed her face into the fence trying to attack Taco. (This is all happening as out nabors other dog was sitting in the middling of it trying to get my attention. But everyone(including me) ignored him)

"Strange behavior after spaying
Hello, so my female cat (about 10 months old) was spayed nearly 2 months ago. She was good, and still very active, no strange behavior. But today, I've noticed some strange behaviour, she wasn't active or playfull as usual, sleeps a lot, doesn't have appetite, and has some clear discharge. Also she pooped in the house, which she has never done before. At first I was thinking it was because of the disconfort in her ear (she has some mini parasites which bother her, but shes already  getting treatment for that) 

Now, should I be worried about some infections, or post spay complications?

Edit: so we have her brother too, who's the same age, but not neutered, and he started to behave kinda in a ""I want to mate way"". Could she be affected by him?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1iqw4fd/strange_behavior_after_spaying/,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Rabbits are delicate creatures that can quickly die if they stop eating for any reason, such as fear, pain, or a serious systemic disease. They can literally just decide to stop eating and die rapidly. If a rabbit hasn’t eaten or defecated in more than 6 hours, it’s crucial to take it to a veterinarian as soon as possible. If you have access to herbivore critical care, you can try syringe-feeding him about 10-20 mL of the paste if he tolerates it to stimulate his gut and slow gastrointestinal stasis from developing. However, this is just to buy time until you can go to the ER and see a veterinarian immediately.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1iox3ht/rabbit_behavior/#mcn8w85,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Kittens have had diarrhea for over a month but display normal behavior. What’s wrong? 
Rescued two kittens Oct 23rd this year. Male & female around 5-6 months old.

I noticed diarrhea in the female from the start and the male is on and off solid and not so solid. I thought it was stress from moving to a new area (they were kept in a garage, the rescue is overloaded) but it's been what I thought would be long enough for them to adjust. 

I thought maybe it was diet but they don't display weird behaviors and they don't have any skin issues (no itching), no vomiting, no lethargy, and they drink just fine. 

Then my sister who is in vet school said it could potentially be tapeworms. Checked their documents and found they weren't treated for them so I gave them medication from Walmart. That was 2 weeks ago and while it says it can take 2-3 weeks for it to work their stool is still a mix of runny, half solid/runny, and soft solid. 

I'm at a loss now. The only other thing I've noticed is they scratch their ears more often than normal and sometimes the male makes a noise when he does it. My guess is ear mites (got some liquid drops for that) but maybe they have ear infections or something. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated! The vet is the next stop if this doesn't clear up soon. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1h4gvqc/kittens_have_had_diarrhea_for_over_a_month_but/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Weird behavior
https://imgur.com/a/H9JA5Du

Hello! Above is a video of this weird thing my cat Yuji has been doing. He’s a 4 year old gray tabby cat. 

The behavior is that he’ll suddenly start licking whatever surface he’s on (though it happens more on the floor). He’s been doing this for months now but I still haven’t been able to fix it. I’ve already tried treating him for fleas and cleaning my whole place and my other cat has never shows any symptoms of having fleas. They are both indoor cats. 

We’ve also tried medication if this is a behavioral/mental health issue and he has been on amantadine and gabapentin with no improvement.

I just wanted to ask if anyone else has had a cat that has done something similar? If so, what was it and what did you do that helped.

I appreciate any advice!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1iz1l14/weird_behavior/,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Junior cat (9 months), sudden leg cramp like behavior
Pre-Info: During this writing, I mention the symptom of my cat as cramp like behavior because it looks like so. I'm not diagnosing my cat with anything or I'm not trying to divert the conversation to this direction. It's just a description of the behavior that I observe. 

Species: Cat

Age: 9 months

Sex/Neuter status: Male, not neutered

Breed: Tabby Cat (cross-breed I assume)

Body weight: Around 4 kg

  
General history: He is a young cat. Super active, well eating and there is no sign of sickness until today. We are constantly stimulating him with games and introducing new things in the house. He likes to wake us up in the morning and he never shows aggression even if we capture him (or cutting his nails etc.). We give him food with very precise grams and spontaneous wet food to support his development. He is pooping at least once a day and he pees around twice a day. There is no extraordinary deformation or differences on his poops or pees in terms of color, size, or shape. 

Clinical signs: temporary cramp-like behavior on his left leg only, following aggression if we go nearby him. During the cramp-like behavior, he suddenly screams in pain. If he is in resting completely lying down, it seems okay.

Duration: Cramp-like behavior just takes 1-2 min to disappear. 

Location: France

Test results: None (at the moment)

Incident history: A couple of hours ago (around 19h in Europe time), our cat suddenly had a pain in his left back leg and he showed super aggressive behavior (not towards us). Initially, we thought that it could be due to something that is disturbing his paw but after our initial examination, we couldn't find anything at all. Then we tried to touch and sense where could be the pain. If we touch the upper part of the back left leg, he becomes so uncomfortable and he tries to escape from us. After the first incident, he got some rest (around 1h30min), then he even wanted to play with us. So, we tossed his favorite toys around the house and he chased them after them. After a 5-minute play session, his left back leg became like a stone which looked like a severe cramp. When we try to approach him, he just walked away to another room to just lie down. After a minute or so, he shows no sign of aggression. 

As we can remember until this time, we are not aware of any possible trauma that might be induced to him such as jumping from a high ground, something to impact on the leg, and so on. At the place where we live, there is no veterinarian that we can go and we don't have a car. However, we are getting prepared to visit an urgent veterinary this evening (if possible).   


Before we visit the veterinary, I would like to ask if someone has already seen this behavior and what were the diagnosis.

"Worsening cat bowel behavior after vet visit
Hi all,

I have a (soon to be) 14-yo male cat who was diagnosed with IBD 10 years ago and has been on a prescription diet for it ever since with no issues. (Royal Canine Vet Diet Hydrolized protein dry food)

In the past year, he has developed allergies and asthma, and in the past couple months, pretty consistent diarrhea. The first visit to this vet last year identified his allergies and he was treated with some steroids and was fine until around October when his diarrhea began. 

His symptoms worsened so I finally took him back. Cough/congestion had gotten worse and his diarrhea wasn’t letting up. At his first visit, he had a heart murmur identified but with a normal ProBNP test. This second visit had an abnormal reading as well as suspected bronchitis on an x-ray. He has a scan scheduled in two weeks to determine the severity of his heart failure. 

In the meantime, the vet gave him an injection of Baytril and ordered a prescription of Azithromycin solution, as well as giving me a box of Forti-flora to “firm up his stool” so they can run a diarrhea panel this coming week. 

It’s been over a day since he’s been home and he has started having bowel incontinence on top of his diarrhea. I just finished cleaning an accidental bowel movement off my bedsheets. Whenever he does use the litterbox for a bowel movement, it looks as if he’s forcefully pushing/cramping while he poops. 

The reason I’m posting is to ask if there’s anything I can do currently to help him out? Should I wait and hope the Fortiflora does help firm his stool? Try to get different food? I’m at a loss.

"Anxiety, Behavior, and Underlying Pain
To start off, my dog is a 2 yr old, spayed, Australian Cattle Dog/Husky Mix. The first year of her life is unknown. I’ve been working with a CDBC and my Vet team so far on her behavior concerns, mainly anxiety, reactivity, nervous system disregulation, anxiety over novel environments, etc. Right now she’s on sertraline and clonidine. We’ve been making progress, however, it just seems like we’re missing a piece of the puzzle. Progress is trending upwards, but there are setbacks in her behavior without any change to our routine, environment, or presence of triggers.

I know pain in dogs can lead to reactivity. I’ve been thinking this could be a missing component to our behavior therapy work. However, there’s not any drastic signs of pain. What I’m going off of is an aversion to any kind of touch, aversion to limb manipulation, aversion to gear and handling, discomfort when being pet, and leg shaking/twitching, especially when stretched out. 

For those that have dealt with behavior concerns plus pain, how big of a piece was diagnosing and pain management? Have you had cases of dogs with subtle signs of pain that you were able to diagnose? How do I go about articulating these thoughts without sounding like I’m making something out of nothing, considering there’s no extreme signs of discomfort? Any discussion around pain and behavior is welcome!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ivri5a/anxiety_behavior_and_underlying_pain/,,,,,,,,,,,,
