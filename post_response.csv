失智的狗狗，如果晚上四處走，不懂自己睡，是否買輪椅給牠晚上用，讓牠累就直接睡比較好？但我看到長期用手腳的位置會紅呢，應該怎樣比較好？（現在都是抱牠入睡，但凌晨牠自己起身我也不知道呢）請指教。,"輪椅不能坐太久
最多半小時
也不要讓狗狗在上面睡覺會不舒服血液不循環
容易不小心就走了",,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/qFf55T4BgHJs6TzY/
,如果不坐車嘅時候，就用頸圈保護，行路跌低也不會損害頭部,image01.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/qFf55T4BgHJs6TzY/

,輪椅子最重要托住頭部，及𠄘托到身體，我寶貝坐及睡眠也很舒服，反而他躺着睡就不停要起床及打圈卡行，在車上已讓他行到累了，通常半夜在輪椅垂透了，就可放他再躺着睡,image03.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/qFf55T4BgHJs6TzY/
,可以試試蘇活沙美+樂寵安神沛，我家貓咪之前很嚴重，整天走不停，一天只睡半小時。吃了改善很多,,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/qFf55T4BgHJs6TzY/
,睡前按摩，我後來沒讓牠一直走，因走的時間越來越長，會打斷牠，抱過來按摩頭。大約三週，恢復了，狗子沒那麼傻，耳朵又聽到我在叫牠了。半夜也不太會起來走來走去,,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/qFf55T4BgHJs6TzY/

"關於犬失智有問題想請益
上禮拜開始發現家中小狗（11歲）開始對於指令失去反應，聯想到前陣子他開始偶爾會躲在角落，有時候好像也會不認得我姊姊，懷疑他開始有失智的情形。
1.已有預約台大神經科醫師診察，但要等一個多月，想詢問大台北地區有其他專科醫師有專長看失智可以推薦嗎？
2. 另外，他目前除上述之外，精神活力食慾等都很正常，在犬認知障礙評估表上的分數也不算高（33分），這樣看專科醫生的意義大嗎？（因為爬文發現失智是屬於排除是診斷，需要靠症狀的察覺去確診）
3.爬文發現失智可以使用蘇活莎美、腦活素、中鏈油，請問這些都算是保健食品嗎？還是藥品？
在還沒看過醫生前，我可以先給狗狗使用嗎？
4.想請問如果做高壓氧大家使用的頻率為何？
大家的經驗裡，改善的情況又是如何？
爬文發現失智可能會惡化的很快，而且最後會癱瘓、危及性命，我現在有點驚慌，先謝謝各位的幫助🙏🙏",中獸醫去年開始推廣失智的檢驗系統跟調養中藥,,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/6DkLRFqSQQBN7G3M/
,"如果嗅覺還很好很愛吃零食，可以天天跟牠玩藏寶遊戲，先將零食藏在他窩周遭，再慢慢擴大範圍到。
去年一度也是發現家中老狗卡在角落哀嚎，我是用零食引誘他進出那角落+開始藏寶遊戲訓練，同時吃腦活素，有改善。",,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/6DkLRFqSQQBN7G3M/
,3. 可以提前給，那些都算是保健品,,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/6DkLRFqSQQBN7G3M/
,腦神經病變會引發很多後遺症。多補充魚油腦部營養品，抗氧化食物，抗發炎食物都要添加。運動或按摩不要間斷。失智無法完全復原。但是要預防惡化。,,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/6DkLRFqSQQBN7G3M/
,我家是18歲老狗狗，最近有一直轉圈圈，會跑去撞牆壁加上一直流口水跟歪頭，醫生有開沙美跟肝腦症的藥物，另外搭配高壓氧，效果還不錯，給妳參考看看,,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/6DkLRFqSQQBN7G3M/
"家中狗狗16歲了，
去年底開始出現失智的症狀後來也被診斷，
最近這2個月和家人都沒有睡好覺，
狗狗半夜都會起來走路、繞圈圈、跌倒站不起或是卡住出不來就會尖叫，
原本因為擔心狗狗年紀大了，
身體無法負荷鎮定安眠的藥物，
所以都是以保健食品為主，
後來醫師有開康格憶、安神沛，
但是沒有顯著改善…
也已經影響到家人健康
甚至開車上下班途中打瞌睡，差點撞上前車…
約一週前請醫師開了鎮定安眠的藥
醫師也說因為考量狗狗心臟和肝臟不好
所以劑量非常輕微，
慢慢視狗狗的情況調整藥物
可是狗狗吃完藥後是呈現身體無法動彈 
然後感覺好像很害怕無法控制自己的身體
會一直掙扎跟尖叫
但是藥物的作用會讓他無法動
狗狗緊張到一直喘氣、防護墊上都是他的口水
看了真的很心疼…
詢問醫師表示仍須再調整藥物
想請教有其他好的照護建議嗎？

,應該會很多人建議你用東西把牠圍在一個範圍內走動~~我家狗也是會自己卡在廁所 就會叫～我後來就把牠會走進去的地方擋起來~~只能見招拆招!因為你接下去可能還要面對它會亂大小便 踏來踏去的崩潰狀況.....,,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/vAAY4JiM3AfdQ496/

,"建議您白天可以短時間+多次數（每天至少3~4次，每次約15~20分鐘）地帶牠外出曬曬太陽，能走動走動更好。

1.蘇活沙美─去年10月開始吃，沒效才會嚴重到今年3月去看台大
2.腦活素─吃了立刻瘋狂轉圈，趕快停吃
3.中鏈脂肪酸 MCT oil─持續吃當中
4.腦力活─從3月底開始吃到現在，轉圈變的嚴重了
掙扎了一個星期，決定要給他換藥了，吳醫師的清單中，只剩下一個沒嘗試了『AgmaVet 樂寵安神沛』。
請問有沒有寶貝試過安神沛?覺得如何呢?還是有沒有哪位不錯的獸醫、有推薦過別的商品呢?

"Decided to let my dog with dementia go
He is scheduled to be euthanized (in-home) this coming Sunday.

I just joined this sub so I apologize if this is not the place to post this.  My 16.5 year old male Jack Russell Terrier (Dexter) has progressive dementia or  Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD) and was diagnosed about a year and half ago.  Symptoms have progressed somewhat slowly  over the course of the year and a half but if I compare to how he is today versus just say, 2 months ago, things are noticeably different compared to when he was first diagnosed and 3 months after.Overall, over the course of the last 8 to 12 months, I managed an average of around 4 to 6 hours of sleep a night as my dog would wake and pace in circles.  Currently, he has all of the classic symptoms including urinating frequently (every 10 to 15 minutes if not taken out) indoors and when defecating indoors or outdoors, he would fall over on himself due to his weak legs.  There's two options during his daily life and that is either to sleep or when he's awake, he would pace in circles.  He also has signs of staring into space or getting ""stuck"" by simple things like a chair leg.  It takes me anywhere from 1 hour to 3 hours every night to get him to lay in his bed and stay there. But that doesn't guarantee he will remain there enough for me to get a somewhat good night sleep.

The most difficult part is at times, he will seem like himself.  He will seem like he's aware and he will do his little happy jog for a few paces when he smells his treat. Like today, I gave him a kiss and he kissed me right back. He has not done this in close to a year.  And this was right after I finalized the time with the vet.  It's so heartbreaking.  Is it a sign?  Ugh.  But I know the CCD has either fully consumed him or is very close and I have been struggling - and currently feeling an intense and enormous amount of guilt that I may be putting him to sleep too soon or that I may be doing this because I have to take him out to pee every 10 minutes or have to hold him up so he can perform #2 in at 3am, or know that I have to clean his entire cage and bath him after coming back from work or dinner because he's soiled himself by being left alone for just 3 to 4 hours.

I know that this is my decision but that doesn't make it any better.  Has anyone else gone through this?  I'm finding myself ( a grown 44-year old man) breaking down in tears in the middle of the day, in the shower, and even while working out thinking about all of this.  With the euthanization coming Sunday, I am absolutely dreading the weekend.  I've taken so many online ""quality of life"" assessments but I come out more confused and guilty as ever - even though the majority indicate it is time.

I'm at the point where I'm starting to think about ""well, if this problem with Dexter didn't exist, would I still euthanize him"" and I do this with every ""issue"" to see if I'm being some kind of selfish a-hole.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is.  To vent?  To ask for help?  To be reassured?  No idea.  This is my first pet and the first death of anything that's so close to me about to pass away.",,,https://reddit.com/r/DogCare/comments/zgbvjz/decided_to_let_my_dog_with_dementia_go/
,He has no quality of life and you have made the right decision as hard as it is. You've been good to him. Try to rest easy on your decision.,,https://reddit.com/r/DogCare/comments/zgbvjz/decided_to_let_my_dog_with_dementia_go/#izg9has
,"I had a Rottweiler who was the kindest, most loving being I’ve ever met. We rescued her at an older age and gave her the best life. She was spoiled and I told her every day I was thankful she chose us. Being older, she developed tumors a few months after adopting her. Had one round of removals but we knew it could come back. It did. 

The mass was very large and the surgery was going to be costly and she might not wake back up from it, so we decided to manage her pain and continue to give her love. Had to adjust our schedules, but it was worth it. One morning her mass split open. It was awful. We rushed to the vet and had to make the impossible decision that it was her time. I was devastated. 

The vet said one thing that I hope will help you: they will NEVER euthanize an animal if they can see the animal is not ready to go. They will never choose to end their life early, and that brought some small comfort. 

Enjoy the time you have, celebrate your dog while you can, and be there with them if you are able. You’ll be a mess and that’s very expected. Take your time to grieve.

,"I am going through the same exact thing with my 15 year old. We have him on medicine that has helped with his dementia for a few months, but the last few weeks he seems to be sliding further into it. Our vet taught us how to make him defecate, get a finger glove with some Vaseline and just stick it in slowly until he pushes it out. We do this every day especially if we have to leave the house. The diapers have helped a lot too. Otherwise, everything else has been about the same as your situation. My fiancé just broke down crying today too. I don’t want to let him go, but if he keeps freaking out like this nonstop all through the night I don’t think I’m doing him any favors by holding on, as much as I love him.

After I got bit a couple times I knew I couldn't be sure it wouldn't be a kid next. Would have been cruel to cage him 24 hrs a day, but I felt so horrible when I took him to the vet.

We had to put down our nearly 14 year old pitbull last year as his health was steadily deteriorating and he could barely stand anymore. We had him since he was eight weeks old. It was so hard. We also chose in-home euthanasia as well, and it was the best decision we could have made. The vet that came over made it such a peaceful and loving experience. We petted him and told him that we loved him right until the end. If I could use that same ending for myself when the time comes, I would. 

The morning of the euthanasia, we did as many things that he loved that he was still able to participate in. We put him in a wagon and took him to the park so he could smell some park smells. We put them on a blanket outside lay in the sun & get pets. We played a movie with lots of dogs for him to bark at with impunity if he felt like it (he didn’t). We offered him lots of naughty treats, like hamburger, grapes, and chocolate. His last day is lawless and it was beautiful. Each day afterward gets a little easier. Rest assured that you’re doing the right thing by your little buddy and it won’t be easy, but you will be OK. He knows he’s deeply loved.

"Question about diaper use
Hi,

I have a 16 year old female spayed dog who is starting to become incontinent and senile. She started peeing in the house about 4 months ago, but the accidents are becoming more frequent. She is already on Proin, but I'm finding that she sometimes just pees in the house. Not like a subconscious dribble in her sleep, but rather, a full on puddle of pee in the house, without warning. It seems intentional to me, and likely more cognitive/behavioral vs weak bladder muscles

I'm going to take her to the vet soon to rule out any health concerns, and maybe get her Anipryl for her CCD.  But in the mean time, I am just starting, as of today, to put her in a diaper. This is mainly for when I'm at work and can't let her go outside. When I'm home from work, she will not be in a diaper, and I try to walk her multiple times.

The diaper thing is brand new to me. If I come home from work and find that she has soiled her diaper, should I immediately bathe her? I'm just concerned about urine scalding/UTIs/rashes if she has to be in a wet diaper for a couple hours before I get home etc. Any advice is appreciated.

,"I have had two neutered male dogs in diapers due to incontinence once they were older.  One of the dogs had a very severe reaction to Proin after two doses so that was not an option and I refused to try it on my other dog after that experience.  So diapers was the only option for us.

I found it to be easiest to have multiple diapers so they could be changed frequently and if I wasn’t able to do a load of laundry that day, I still had enough clean.  I found reasonably priced ones on Amazon in 3 packs and ended up with 9 total diapers for each dog. (They were different sizes).  I used Lysol Laundry Sanitizer (in the detergent aisle) in addition to my normal detergent when washing them.

You do want to clean the dog if it’s urinated and sat in the diaper to prevent urine burn.  I didn’t need to give my dogs baths daily or even weekly  necessarily, but I did clean the area with gentle or pet soap and water daily (sometimes multiple times a day depending) and in between baths.  I was fortunate to be able to take mine out on my lunch break so he was not sitting for too long of a period of time but if you have to wait your whole shift I still think she would be ok without having an issue being that you’d clean her off when you got home and took her out.

My dogs never previously had issues with UTI’s but they did get them on and off as they got older once they were in the diapers and it was really obvious as the diapers would suddenly smell really bad.  If you notice a foul smell suddenly, definitely have them assessed by the vet as they probably have a uti.  I’ll never know if they were caused from the diapers, them getting older or their other health issues but they weren’t constant and were easily treated.

Honestly once I got the hang of using the diapers they weren’t any problem at all to deal with.  They’re much better than the alternative of having a leaky bladder in the house or on the furniture and only took a little adjusting to get used to for me.  The dogs never seemed to care to wear them either.  

Good luck to you.  It’s can be so hard once they get older but she is lucky to have you.",,https://reddit.com/r/DogCare/comments/163upxf/question_about_diaper_use/#k1tgcvu

"Will adding vegies to senior dogs diet help or hinder constipation?
2mths ago my aunt's 14yr old dog had his anal glands expressed due to constipation. 
He now does very firm stools but is starting to have some bowel incontinence, not quite getting outside when he needs to (he is on his way to dementia).

I've read up about vegies being good to add fibre to their diet and help pass stools, but have also seen advice saying too much fibre will soften his stools too much (eg diarrhoea, which with bowel incontinence would not be ideal!). Also is one large meal s day okay or would morning and evening  smaller meals be best?

His diet is currently:
-one portion of raw mince (unsure of brand, I'm just housesitting)
-some tablespoons of Lyka
-some kibble, whatever brand (optimum ATM)

It is one big meal at night. Should I make it two feeds, and would a handful of steamed veggies each feed help or hinder his digestion?

"Need advice!! behavior changes in my senior dog
Hello all. My dog is currently about 10-11 years old. He's a rhodesian ridgeback, and we've had him for 10 years. Over the last few months, we've noticed some major behavior changes, and I'm super worried about him.

For context, l'm 17 currently living with my dad.
My parents separated earlier this year, and my mom moved out about 6 months ago. She was my dog's favorite, and she was the one who primarily fed him, gave him water, etc. Since then, I have filled in that role. My dog hasn't seemed to exhibit any signs of major depression, but all of these behavioral changes started after she moved out.

1. Increased appetite (but decreased interest in his own food)—My dog has always begged for food (it was never really trained out of him), but over the last few months, it has gotten so much worse. He will whine and whine at us until our plates are fully put away in the dishwasher. We rarely give in, so I don't think this is a learned behavior. It only started getting bad in the last few months. At the same time, though, he refuses to eat his own kibble that we give him. He will avoid it like the plague, sometimes eating the kibble that we give to our other dog instead. This has caused major issues for us and I'm not sure if it's any cause for concern, or if he's just being a dog that doesn't know any better.

2. Heavy panting-along with the begging has come heavy, and I mean *heavy* panting. He breathes like he's never taken a sip of water before, it's really concerning. This only happens when we're eating meals in front of him, though.

3. Restlessness at night-self explanatory. He will spend hours pacing around at night downstairs, whining at the door, waking us up in the middle of the night to go outside. He usually sleeps in my parents room. He never used to do this before my mom moved out, he would always sleep through the night.

4. Increased thirst-also self explanatory. My boy is THIRSTY lol

5. General increased anxiety-this is also especially at night. I just notice more self soothing behaviors. Liplicking, averting his gaze, etc. He's also more often posted up in our laundry room, which I know is one of his comfort spots. His main comfort spot was my mom's closet before she left, but he doesn't really go in there anymore.

Could this all be related to my mom moving out? I thought he was adjusting well but maybe he's not. I'm leaving for summer job soon and then moving for school, and I'm worried about how that'll affect him if this is the case. I'm also worried about Cushings and possible dementia. At what point do I bring him to the vet? This is my childhood dog and I love him very deeply.

"Best Tools/Systems/Routines for Accidents?
My elderly dog has gotten to the point where he's pretty much fully un-housebroken now-- it started with #2 about a year ago, and as of the last month or two, now #1 as well. It's presumably dementia/neuro related per the vet and trainers. It's not perfect but manageable when the weather's moderate, which is most of the time, as I keep him (and his food/water/a mat) on the covered porch and just accept that there will be accidents out there. When it's too hot or cold, however, what can I do when I have to leave him inside?   
\-He's not trained to stay in his crate for long stretches (several hours)

\-He's extremely furry, so diapers aren't a good option

\-He has never peed on a rug/ seems to always go in the hard floor hallway/kitchen...so just cover that entire area in puppy pads all the time? 

Is there any other option I'm not thinking of?  (Also, FWIW, I'm not at the place of thinking of end of life yet, since according to the vet he doesn't seem to be in pain and he still has some good days where he enjoys walks/ always wants snacks and pets)",,,https://reddit.com/r/DogCare/comments/17vgbqu/best_toolssystemsroutines_for_accidents/

"what items do dogs need?
Got a great aunt moving in with me with her two dogs in 2 weeks and I'm not sure what the dogs need because I've never had one before. I've already picked some treats up for them and she already has bowls for them and some other stuff like beds but she's in her 80's with dementia so it will be up to me and my sis to care for them mostly like walking them, taking them to the groomers or vets.

I plan to buy toys soon but I'm not sure what toys are best? I was looking at like soft toys today from pets at home but thought they might get destroyed easily?

One dog is a west highland white terrier male 3 years old and the other is a German shepherd lurcher mix around 5-7 years old.

I'd appreciate any information on what I need to get for them.

So far on the list is

New Collars, 
Leashes,
Toys,
New Bowls If needed (they have some already),
Bed for one dog If needed right now she prefers sleeping with my aunt on the bed and
Poop Bags, grooming supplies, natural dried chews, nail clippers. Harness, big lead

We're making the back garden safe for them and there is a dog park down the road.

Update: just been out and my god there was so many toys to choose from. I got them some chews, toys and travel bowls for the 5 hour journey home. I got them a mixture of toys so some soft and some hard I wasn't sure what they preferred. Also got poop bags almost forgot those. Tried finding a brush but the options they had out weren't very good. Got them this bone with marrow inside which my aunt said her dogs love.

I will be getting the other stuff listed soon. Had a look at harnesses, long leads and collars but I wasn't sure what size to get so I'll get them when they're here when I can measure them and I'm not sure what lead my aunt has so I'll check that out too.

,"Basic grooming supplies like dog shampoo/conditioner/brushes, depending on how often you’ll be having them professionally groomed.

Might be nice for each of them to have a bed? I like having a spot just for my dog, in the living room and the bedroom. My dog prefers having her own space to work on her own stuff (eating snacks, chewing bones, ripping stuff she’s allowed to rip, etc.)

,"You and your sis sound like good people taking in your great aunt and her dogs like this :) 

I'm not sure what your aunt already has, but a brush might be helpful if there isn't one already. And as far as toys go, most dogs seem to have a preference for what style of toy (if any) they prefer. Some love soft plushies, some love kongs or other hard toys, others just want a ball. Stuffed toys in general won't last super long, although it also depends on the dogs play style and the durability/build of the toy.

Also, make sure you brush up on what is poisonous to a dog (you can find posters and infographics online). Some can be unexpected. For example, grapes and raisins can be toxic. Xylitol can be deadly and is found in many things like mints, toothpaste, and gum. Good to be aware of what to keep an eye out for, either in your back garden or what may drop on your kitchen floor.

-Nail clippers, the [Safari](https://www.chewy.com/safari-professional-nail-trimmer-dogs/dp/46024) are my favorite (either size works for all size dogs, do whichever fits your hand better).  
-[Shampoo, conditioner](https://www.ryanspet.com/).  
-Chews. Toys are for interactive play NOT for shredding. Toys are ropes, balls, stuffed animals, etc. that you play fetch or tug with together. Chews are edible and for gnawing/licking/chewing on. Stuffed Kongs, [bully sticks](www.bestbullysticks.com), nohide/cheeky rolls (I avoid rawhide and anything that is just skin like ears; no hard teeth-breaking bones or antlers either).

,"In addition to your list I'd maybe add a long lead (10-15m). It will be helpful to give them some almost-liberty on forest/field/trail walks while training them to come back to you when you call them.

For the toys, all depends on what they already have and like. Hard chew toys, plushies, rope toys, balls.... Some destroy plushies/rope in seconds, some are much softer with their plushies/rope and do not tear them to pieces event months later.

Talking of chews in addition to the treat you already got, for sure get them single ingredient natural dried chews like yak cheese, cod skin, dried tripe, pig snout, beef tendons, duck wings, half split antlers, hooves ..... Avoid those ""fake white bones"" (I don't remember the word in English rn) or stuff with a ingredient list long as an arm.  Chews will help keep them occupied when home and clean teeth.

Items that aren't in the necessary bracket but imo should be, are lickimats, toppl, wobble balls, slowfeeders ect. Basically occupations games for the dog to get to their food. Makes them much more tired than ""just eating out of a boring bowl"".

,"This happened to us a couple months before our dog passed. It will take some communication and patience with your pet, and what you're asking is not easy but possible.


Similar to your situation, it started with her hind limbs weakening, and instead of squatting down, she would just pee all over her legs. She was a stubborn one, so all I could do was just hold her (as you would if you were about to lift her up, and let her know I was ready to catch her weight if she stumbled) while she stood over her usual peeing spot and let her do her thing. At this time, she wasn't the cleanest dog but hey, that's life. 


Gradually as her mobility faded, we built a new routine and she became comfortable with being held while peeing. At that point, she knew to wait until she was lowered above her spot, and things got easier. She would bark to let us know when she needed to pee (she did require round the clock care at this point). That eventually extended to pooing, except that often took longer, and sometimes required a bit of sitting with her on our laps at the front steps. I think both you and him will know when he's ready to do that.


On top of cleanliness, you also need to watch out for matted hair and bed sores, signs of mental/neurological stress, physical pain from his underlying conditions (e.g. arthritis), change in appetite, among other things. Give him lots of brushes and massages. Change his position for him regularly if he can, and read his signals to see if he's happy and comfortable.


I have to agree with everyone here though, this is the beginning of the end. This is palliative care. Make plans for the final goodbye now because it may come sooner than you think. I know you're a good dog parent, and you're trying, but honestly, you may both be better off to let him go now because it's not always easy for the dog (and you) to establish a new routine.

We play ""find it"" with kibble or treats, where I either toss one into grass for him to find or hide a few in tricky spots for him inside (or a mix of tricky and not so tricky). 

For the puppy, the towel thing is a little tougher because she's such a big oaf. Also she eats a TON, too much for one interactive toy, so when I'm gamifying her meals it's some combo of training, a rolling ball that dispenses the kibble, a slow-feeder bowl, and ""find it"" - with her I drop or hide food all over the living room for her to find rather than just a few pieces. I have to make sure the little guy can't interrupt the game because he will sneakily join in, and he'll find anything she's missed if I don't check. 

Both dogs enjoy chewing antlers, yak chews, bones, etc. They also love berries, ice cubes, and bits of dog-friendly vegetables like carrots and green beans as treats - I'm not sure if any of those fit your dog's diet. 

I realize all of these ideas rely on the dogs being able to eat kibble/ chew hard things. If your dog needs soft foods or has other tricky requirements, maybe putting something like pumpkin onto a lick mat could be stimulating, or freezing homemade broth in something for him to lick. You could use a little bowl of wet food for ""find it."" If you're doing any training for enrichment, I've heard of people using licks of a block of frozen broth as a reward. I can't remember what they described, essentially something like freezing a broth popsicle that's easy to hold. (Obviously, dog-safe broth with no onion or garlic.)

The puppy loves peanut butter kongs but I imagine pb is not specialized diet friendly. I was surprised to learn about the variety of things people put in them. Greek yogurt, pumpkin, cheese, treats... Maybe you can come up with something that fits your dog's special diet. If his teeth are ok you can freeze it to make it last longer.

This might sound dumb but another thing I've been doing with my dogs sometimes is taking them on what I call a scent adventure. I take them somewhere and just let them sniff. The name is partially about the mindset for me. It doesn't have to be big. A trip to pick up takeout can mean a scent adventure in the parking lot. Other times it's a little more intentional, ex the other day I took them to a random empty playground and put the younger pup on a long leash to explore with her nose.",,https://reddit.com/r/DogCare/comments/nylxhn/good_enrichment_for_an_elderly_dog_who_struggles/#h1mptll

There are times when there seems to be no pleasing her, such as she is constantly barking and won’t eat and just seems restless for days at a time. My aunt who works at a vet clinic thinks it could be a form of dementia.

"Proactively Preventing CCD
Hello,

My 15ish year old pup passed away in July from presumably cancer (we chose not to do further diagnostics because he was on everything he could be) but struggled with canine cognitive decline for about 2 years prior. Thankfully, Selegiline made a huge impact and kept him relatively stable for much of those 2 years. A lot of vets didn’t recommend it for some reason but it was night and day improvement. When he couldn’t take it anymore, he spiraled quickly. I don’t think he knew who me and my husband were the last week or two. It was really hard. I had him for almost 13 years.

Anyway, we adopted a new pup about a week later to help prevent me spiraling honestly. She’s been great. Tiny 4.5 lb chihuahua. She’s only about 11 months old. I’m just wondering if there are foods or supplements that might be helpful now to help keep her brain as healthy as possible as long as possible. I’d like to avoid going through CCD with a dog again if possible. It was heartbreaking.

Any tips? She is currently on Zignature Small Bites Lamb Formula dry food and I use a bit of canned food (also Zignature) of different flavors to help her eat the dry food. No supplements. Just monthly flea/heartworm/tick prevention otherwise.

Thanks for your time!",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1fz3sat/proactively_preventing_ccd/

"CCD and aggression... any connection to Simparica?
My family and I had to put down our 7 1/2 year old mixed breed rescue dog because of increasingly common aggression incidents a few years ago, and the vet was never able to figure out what was causing it. It started with resource guarding food but only with a few members of the family and didn't get much worse than just small growls. Then he had a few isolated incidents of getting aggressive with visitors that he knew well and he had greeted happily at the door, which we thought for a while had something to do with eyesight, because he seemed to just not recognize them all of a sudden. It got worse over time despite our best attempts at training, and he eventually bit me, even though I had been the one person he had never shown even slight aggression towards, and my mom in two separate incidents.

For a time we questioned if it had anything to do with the medicine Simparica, because it got worse when he started taking it and got better for a while after we stopped giving it to him. But the vet, throughout blood tests and an MRI, found no evidence of any other issues. I just came across an article on Canine cognitive dysfunction, which I had never heard of, and got this sinking feeling in my stomach because the aggression issues, heightened anxiety, sudden inability to recognize familiar people, vision impairment, lethargy, etc all sounds eerily like the changes we saw in him.

I'm not quite sure what I'm asking exactly, I just want desperately to finally have some sort of answer on what happened to my best friend. Does it seem possible/likely that this is what he was experiencing? Are there any cases anyone has seen of relation between CCD and Simparica?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1fc6909/ccd_and_aggression_any_connection_to_simparica/

"Dog with CCD suddenly much worse
My dog has been battling CCD for awhile - the sundowners, pacing, getting stuck under stuff, lower appetite. She’s seen improvement on Senilife and was recently started on Librela injections for her pain, which has improved her arthritis and was helping some of her sleep symptoms. Usually if she doesn’t get enough sleep at night, she catches up during the day. 

However, we had a vet visit to discuss some plans and got her second Librela injection on Wednesday. For two nights, she slept better than she has in months. Then on Saturday, she started pacing. And did not stop. She won’t sleep, day or night, until she is fully exhausted. She ended up having a cluster of 6+ focal seizures over the course of 2 days (she has had them before but not since beginning Gabapentin), but did not stop pacing. We took her to the ER vet and they treated her for epilepsy and started her on Keppra.

Now we’re home, she’s back to pacing after sleeping off her ER meds! We thought maybe the pacing could have been a pre/post-ictal symptom, but she has been seizure free since our ER visit and still unable to stop. She also seems a lot more disoriented and uncomfortable with me, as well as sort of unsure about who we are (the way she was before we began Senilife), when just three days ago she was happy to cuddle up and nap. 

Of course we are trying to get in to see our regular vet, but I am curious if anyone has witnessed this rapid of a backslide before? Given that Librela has been the only change, I am curious, but she didn’t have any reactions to her first injection so I am open to the idea it might be a coincidence.

 Species:

• Age: ~12

• Sex/Neuter status: Female spayed

• Breed: Pug

• Body weight: 15 pounds

• History: CCD, Arthritis, focal seizures. On Gabapentin, Senilife supplements, Librela, and just started Keppra. 

• Clinical signs: Pacing, increased confusion. 

• Duration: 3 days

• Your general location: Midwest USA",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1avhyn9/dog_with_ccd_suddenly_much_worse/

,"It sounds like you’re doing a great job trying to help your pup as much as you can. CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) can be a frustratingly difficult constellation of symptoms to manage and there’s no one treatment answer. Unfortunately, brain disease (tumor, inflammation, fluid accumulation, etc.) can look similar to CCD and without an MRI, it’s impossible to differentiate. In an ideal world, we’d know for sure what we’re treating, but it’s often not the case in veterinary medicine. CCD can suddenly get worse, but when more neurological symptoms develop as I’m treating something that shouldn’t change quickly, I worry about the possibility I’m not treating the right thing. Unfortunately, I’d be worried about a progressing brain tumor or multiple strokes causing what you’re seeing and she may have had it all along and CCD was a reasonable, but incorrect, assumption or another problem is developing in addition to the CCD.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1avhyn9/dog_with_ccd_suddenly_much_worse/#kre3vch

I can't even find a veterinarian who has any knowledge of it whatsoever in my small town of Apache Junction. Does someone know what type of doctor I would see and recommend a doctor who will treat it or at least consider it.

Current doctor doesn't have a clue just says it's a tumor his blood work comes up fine. His behavior is similar to other dogs where people have taken videos online. Every night is extremely difficult during the days a little bit better but I believe this occurred over many years.

"CCD selegiline
Hello,

My dog's been prescribed selegiline 2.5mg for his dementia. He's been taking it for a few days and it seems that it's making his symptoms worse: more restless, walking in circles and new one's like moaning. This was given to us by a neurologist, the side effects weren't discussed, so I assumed the medicine either helps him or nothing changes.

I took my dog to the vet clinic yesterday and the internist said to discontinue the selegiline and prescribed 50mg of Gabapentin twice a day (my dog is 16 and weighs 3kg) to calm him down.

I know that the neurologist is at the clinic on Tuesday so I will call him. In the meantime should Selegiline be stopped abruptly instead of maybe lowering the dose? I'd like to help my dog's dementia if it's possible. Are his side effects normal and would go away or are they serious? I've read about the serotonin syndrome, maybe that's what he was experiencing.

"CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction)
CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction)

Good afternoon everyone,
I’m going to try and make this short and sweet.
My 16 yo mini-Doxy (dachshund) has CCD (essentially doggy dementia).This has caused him to have Day-Night reversal where he is up all night wandering the house whining and crying. He is physically very healthy and has a healthy appetite/thirst. During the early afternoons he is his normal goofy happy go lucky self but at night he changes and becomes frantic and inconsolable.  His vet has tried three different med combos (currently on Gabepentin and Phenobarbital 2x a day) and nothing seems to help. It’s been about four months and I haven’t slept more than 3 hours a night in about two months. My fiancé and I love him more than anything but I am not so sure how much more I can take. I’ve tried a thunder shirt, cuddling, cbd. He normally sleeps with us and has for years but now doesn’t seem to want too. I used to be able to pick him up and he would calm down but now that won’t even help. I’ve tried to talk to the vet about helping him cross the rainbow bridge but he seems insistent on trying different drugs. I’m ok with more options but I also don’t want him to live in a drug fueled haze. The past week or so I’ve payed with him on the living room floor just petting him while he whines. I don’t know what else to do and I’m so tired. Has anyone dealt with this? Does anyone have advice?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/obpkh3/ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction/

,"Vet here. I'm so sorry that you are dealing with this in the home. It puts a strain on that bond we have with our pet. You love them but the constant whining and anxiety that he is suffering from at night keeps everybody up in the house. So, a lot of pet owners consider euthanizing for that exact reason. You are not alone in feeling that way nor are you a horrible pet owner. 

Second, as far as therapy there are a lot of other things that can be tried. Ask your veterinarian for guidance here. 

Just like in humans we are not looking for a cure we are just looking for something that can help with the symptoms. Sometimes that involves SSRIs sometimes that involves selegeline, sometimes that involves Solliquin supplement or Purina Pro Plans Bright Minds diet  or Hill's B/D diet. All of these things can reduce the symptoms and their severity, but obviously we can't cure this disease. We still don't even quite understand what causes it, as there isn't any evidence of plaques developing in the brain like there is in humans with Alzheimer's.

Things that help with humans that may help pets: getting a ""companion"" like those stuffies with mama dog's heartbeat in them can make him feel like he isn't alone, keeping the night time routine EXACTLY the same with little deviation. Keeping him in his ""own little den"" of the house for his safety and your sanity just before his anxiety starts up.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/obpkh3/ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction/#h3ptnph

"Canine Cognitive Dysfunction?
Wondering if anyone has experience with the following:

7 year old ex-racing greyhound, otherwise healthy. Starting about 6 months ago, she has episodes of “confusion” where she wanders around the house head bobbing and looking around aimlessly. Mostly in the middle of the night but one time during the day. Happens every few weeks but this week it’s been twice. It lasts 10-20 minutes and she seemingly “snaps out of it” and finally responds to her name and settles back into her bed. She has peed and pooped in the house during these as well. 

During the episode she barely recognizes us or her surroundings and it’s a clear transition when she comes back to being herself. 

Discussing with vet next week but has anyone experienced a similar phenomenon?

"Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and Sleep
I have a 14 year old shih tzu who was diagnosed with canine cognitive decline about 6-8 weeks ago. 

He does not sleep at night. His current medications include:

Morning:
Selegiline 5mg. He gets this in the morning and we’re coming up on two weeks of use. 

Before bed:
Gabapentin 100 mg
Melatonin 5 mg

All of this was prescribed by my vet, who I’ve been working with closely. No matter what we do, my dog will not sleep through the night and it’s impacting everyone in my house, (including my other dog who sees himself as his brother’s protector) He barks, cries, and paces for hours. He will usually sleep from 11 at night to 1 AM and then all bets are off. Once everyone is up and around, he sleeps most of the day. 

I’ve tried white noise and diffusing lavender oil. He has nightlights throughout the house. I’ve tried keeping him awake during the day and getting more activity. It doesn’t make any difference. During the day, when he’s awake, he’s happy and playful and engaged. He doesn’t seem to experience anxiety during the day at all. I’m not even convinced he’s experiencing anxiety at night. He’s just noisy. 

Any suggestions on what to do next?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/15pv2km/canine_cognitive_dysfunction_and_sleep/

"Making a pet with canine cognitive dysfunction more comfortable?
Hello, vets! We have a vet appointment this evening, but I wanted to source some additional info here.

My senior Frenchie presumably has a brain tumor (seizures began in April, blood test did not indicate something wrong with liver or kidneys, we elected not to do an MRI b/c anesthesia could be risky and our little guy really hates the vet - he's also 10.75 yrs old). We've been successfully managing his seizures with meds for the last 8 months. Recently, he's begun to exhibit signs of canine cognitive dysfunction (doggy dementia). He is pacing at night a for a few hours, forgetting his house training, becoming less responsive to his name, sometimes stares at nothing or will hand out in a corner facing the wall for a few moments). He does not seem scared and he has not become aggressive. He just a seems a little depressed and confused sometimes. 

He loves kisses, cuddles, his food and treats, his little treat dispensing puzzle game and of course napping on every surface, especially his bed. He's definitely not as happy or active as he was before, but we are trying to be really thoughtful about his quality of life and we believe we bring each other  a lot of joy still. 

I know CCD isn't curable, but what have you all found helpful in making dogs more comfortable? I was thinking of asking the vet about medications like Senilife, but he is already on many medications for the seizures (Keppra, phenobarbital, zonisamide, and sometimes clorazepate if he clusters). Sometimes if he is pacing extra at night, we give him a couple droppers of Medterra CBD oil for dogs. 

Right now, we are just being more patient with him, trying to stimulate his mind with his puzzle games, taking him outside in his stroller when it isn't frigid, and not changing up his environment a lot.

"Senior dog with cognitive dysfunction/dementia causing extreme anxiety. Ways to soothe/sedate?
Our 13 year old rescue mutt has been in gradual cognitive decline and is experiencing major anxiety/panic as a result (vet has ruled out other causes of the behavior.)

It has reached the point that he is spending more time freaked out than not, so we made the tough decision that it’s time to say goodbye and we have an appointment for that on Friday. 

In the meantime, I’m desperately looking for any suggestions for ways to calm and soothe him. Over the past several months we (with our vet) have tried Benadryl, trazodone, gabapentin, assorted dietary changes and supplements, CBD, thunder shirt, increased exercise and stimulation, and nothing has made the slightest impact. Even at crazy high doses, none of the sedative meds we have tried have made him at all sleepy or calmed him down at all.

When he’s in panic mode, he paces non-stop, pants super heavily, bats with his paw at anyone and anything in reach, tries to climb on top of us but even when being actively held or petted or cuddled he can’t stay still. Ears as far back as they will go, tail tucked under. He’s just terrified, and nothing I do seems to calm him at all. 

[EDIT to add: we have also tried the plug-in calming hormone diffuser thing and the similar collar, used for several months and never had any apparent effect. Have also tried playing an assortment of “calming music for dogs” stations, etc. I’m telling y’all, there is nothing I won’t try at this point!]

I know it’s time to say goodbye, I’m just trying to find ways to help soothe him in the meantime until our appointment. If anyone has ANY suggestions for sedating meds we haven’t tried or anything that might work?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/xuzz31/senior_dog_with_cognitive_dysfunctiondementia/

"Senior dog with, back end weakness, fecal incontinence and Canine Cognitive Dysfunction
Hi vets, 

Species: dog
Breed: border collie golden retriever mix (best guess) 
Age: approx 13 (she is a rescue)
Spayed/neutered: yes
Weight: 15kg or 33.5 (she has recently lost weight and we have increased her food. She is normally 37-40lbs vets thought it was due to muscle loss. 


My dog in the past year has greatly declined. She is completely deaf and has recently developed cataracts in one eye. Her mobility and back end weakened has slowly gotten worse. These issues have been hard for her but she had still been happy, eating all of her meals, occasionally playing with our other dog, and still enjoying  going on walks to sniff. 

In the past month she has gone from getting up, pacing, and needing to go outside 2-3 times to waking us up every hour to hour and a half. We are currently taking turns sleeping on the couch and letting her outside every hour and generally trying to keep her calm. We are both exhausted. 

We have discussed what has been happening with our vet, but they haven’t suggested any medication or treatment. What I want to to know is whether there is more we can do to help her. She seems really anxious when pacing like she doesn’t know where she is. We also use night lights and try to keep her active during the day. 

She has also recently lost weight and we have increased her food. Would this be related to the pacing or is it something else entirely? 

Sorry for the long post I am just feeling lost and sad for my poor girl.

The fact that she is still alerting you to her needs is a good sign, but even with exhaustive diagnostics, sometimes there is no definitive answer other than ""old dog"". Things are deteriorating in your pup. Her intestines are likely not as good at absorbing nutrients and this is a common issue in older dogs, so weight loss can be an issue. You can request bloodwork if you havent had it done recently to assess organ function, and there may be some medications that can be used to help prolong her life, but quality (of hers AND yours) need to be addressed.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/q1yx3b/senior_dog_with_back_end_weakness_fecal/#hfho5ux

"My dog is 20 years old blind, deaf, with dementia and arthritis. Is it time?
My dog is a maltese who is 20 years old. She has arthritis, is blind, deaf and with dementia. 

I took my dog last year to the vet because I thought she was ready to cross the rainbow bridge. However, my vet who is a holistic vet told me she was still healthy and didn't recommend euthenizing her yet. However, she barks excessively out of nowhere at all hours. She rest a lot which I understand. I feel bad for her since she is blind she is always bumping into things and we have to guide her. She can't control her bladder any nore and will pee anywhere. When I pick her up I can feel the arthritis. The vet also mentioned she might have dementia. I feel it in my heart she has to go but after the vet said no I feel like I must let her die naturally. Everyday I hear her bark for no reason it hurts me emotionally. 

I am lost in making a decision, but I am pretty sure of what needs to happen. Can you all provide some guidance? Is she in pain or is she still okay to live?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ebnok9/my_dog_is_20_years_old_blind_deaf_with_dementia/

,"Sorry you are struggling with the 'is it time' decision. I have been there twice in the past year, so I know it's a hard place to be in with a pet. Our vet told us they are of the opinion, ""It's better to error on the side of too soon rather than a second too late."" If you have the option to do in home euthanasia I highly recommend it as it made the whole ordeal far easier for both us and our dogs.

When we were trying to determine how long to wait with the first dog we lost this year (terminal and on borrowed time) I reached out to my cousin who is a veterinary oncologist for help evaluating quality of life. She shared the guidance she gives her patients with me, and it really helped us gauge the timing.

""To monitor your pet's quality of life, pick 5 things they like to do the most. These can be small things like perking up for a ride in the car, playing with a certain toy, napping in a certain spot. Daily, your pet should be doing 3 of its 5 favorite things for it to be considered a good day. If there is a change to only doing 2 of the 5 favorite things, and we are having more bad days then good days in a 7-day period, we need to decide if we are doing everything we can for your pet's comfort, or if euthanasia would be the most appropriate option.""

I know it's especially hard with older dogs who've had a slow decline. The thing your vet seems to be ignoring is that natural death of an elderly dog can be slow - most of us don't have the good fortune to have a situation where they just pass peacefully in their sleep - and they might not always show signs of pain and discomfort until it's pretty severe. You can talk to the vet about medication for pain and arthritis, but if the dog is older and already having issues with bladder/kidney/liver, etc., certain medications can put extra stress on those systems and might lead to other issues, so you'll have to discuss with the vet and weigh the risks/benefits of medicating a 20-year-old dog.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ebnok9/my_dog_is_20_years_old_blind_deaf_with_dementia/#lexgdko

His ""dementia"" behavior lasted for almost 36hrs: circling, whining, not recognizing the other dog or the cats, or me. He has separation anxiety-and the whining, searching for ""mom""?, behavior happens whenever I leave for a time.                              

He's never not recognized anyone before. 

We woke up today and he seems very close to normal. I'm ""mom"" again!!!

"Change in Behavior in Elderly Dog - Dementia? 
Hi all, 

  
My dog is turning 14 in a few months. I've had her since she was very small, and she is precious to me. In the last 6 months or so, I've noticed some behavioral changes that I don't fully understand. Here are some details:

  
Around 9 months ago, we brought home a cat, a very active and young Bengal. He frequently teases and upsets the dog, and it's clear his behavior is somewhat stressful to her. 

Perhaps 2-3 months later, I noticed the dog no longer responding when called, and not listening when I gave her directions. At first I thought this might be stubbornness and obstinance, due to the cat. However, she also stopped waking when I came in the door, and seemed to be less aware when I moved around the room. This lead me to believe she was experiencing hearing loss instead. What was puzzling, was how apparently rapid the onset was. I have also noticed she has basically stopped requesting to play, which had no apparent connection.

Maybe 2 months ago, she began drinking more water, and having lots of accidents in the house. I took her to a vet and they reported her physically healthy (they did blood tests and urinalysis) but prescribed a medication we might try for incontinence. 48 hours later and she was in severe discomfort, and having accidents every 5 minutes. I took her back in, and they found she had developed a UTI, the first in her life. After the UTI I took her off the incontinence medication, and found she was still having accidents. I put her back on it, and found no change in behavior.

Sometime after this I noticed she no longer seems to want to go outside or to the park across the street. This has been something she greatly enjoyed in the past.

Lately she has been waking up in the middle of the night. I wake up when she does and follow her. She will typically drink for 5-10 minutes, maybe 3-400ml (she's 5kg and this seems like a lot), and then immediately pee on the floor. I have observed she no longer asks to go outside, but she also doesn't pee in her bed or where she's standing. 

Now, I frequently will let her out pre-emptively. She will typically walk just outside the door, pee on the concrete, turn around and come back inside. In the past she has had a strong preference to pee in grass.

I can't figure out the behaviors. Is she incontinent? Is it cognitive decline? Stress? Something else? Why is she not asking to be let out? Why is she drinking so much, with no indicators of a change in physical health? Why is she not asking to play? Can she really not hear, or is she not comprehending? Have we missed something in the health screenings, or is it entirely cognitive?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1dvhq7k/change_in_behavior_in_elderly_dog_dementia/

"My dog has dementia and is aggressive, is it possibly time to euthanise him?
My dog is elderly and has developed dementia. Until now it's been symptoms of confusion and sometimes fear. Now he's starting to be aggressive at random. I have a 10 month old and live in a very small flat. I have no way to keep my baby and dog apart without confining one of them to a very small space for most of the day. 

My dog is about 15, has dementia, he is on medication for arthritis pains, and expensive prescription food because he is prone to pancreatitis. With the aggression on top I don't see how he could be rehomed.

In a small environment with a young child, these symptoms will not go away, and in fact may worsen with time. You would be ensuring your family's best safety by creating final memories with your pet, and offer the dignity of a peaceful transition without the tarnish of an incident that can't be taken back, and wasn't intentional. 
I know its difficult and feels morally grey, as his body hasn't ""failed"" yet. But the mind failing is just as much a part of the body. No one at the office will judge you.

,"You have a fifteen year old dog with dementia. You've provided for that dog for a number of years prior to now. There's no cure for dementia. It's OK to provide him with a peaceful passing, even though he's happy 90% of the time, and not wait until he's miserable 60% of the time before doing so. There is nothing wrong with going out on a good day. 

It's also very common for pet owners of elderly dogs to feel some relief after euthanasia; it IS a lot of work, physically and especially emotionally to take care of our older pets. You don't have to feel guilty about the fact that it might make aspects of your life easier (although please know guilt is a very common emotion in these situations); it doesn't sound like that's why you're considering this choice. It's just a side aspect. 

I'm so sorry you're at this point, but please know there are many resources out there for pet owners at this stage.

,"From one pet parent to another, I’m sorry that you’re going through this now. The fact that you are even debating this decision and seeking advice demonstrates what a wonderful pet parent you are.

My vet provided me with this [OSU diagnostic] (https://vet.osu.edu/vmc/sites/default/files/import/assets/pdf/hospital/companionAnimals/HonoringtheBond/HowDoIKnowWhen.pdf) to better determine when it may be time to euthanize. It can be helpful in minimizing the likelihood of feeling like you’re second-guessing yourself. 

That said, my vet did say that, even if most of the  diagnostic points are not met, good pet parents usually have an idea of when it might be time to euthanize given the specifics of the situation. Based on what you’ve shared, it seems you are there. 

It won’t make it any easier, but from an outside perspective it sounds like you are making the right decision. Right now, although he’s experiencing significant cognitive decline, your dog still knows you and loves you and knows how much you love him. Give him a really good day together and then be with him as he goes.

,"Not a vet

I would first discuss this with the vet to rule out any treatable medical issues causing the aggression. But yes, euthanasia is a perfectly valid option.

As someone who has had to make this same decision, it is not your fault.

There are diseases that we cannot cure. A disease (or old age) that is causing aggression is not something he would want. You have had him for years, do you truly believe he would want to hurt you or your family if he wasn't being affected by this disease? In this scenario, a humane euthanasia is a blessing, not a curse. He gets to go our remembering your love, not feeling like he was abandoned in a strange place, and not feeling bad because he unintentionally harmed you.",,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/k3w7t3/my_dog_has_dementia_and_is_aggressive_is_it/#ge62e0f
,"Better a day early than a day late. New unexpected aggression in an elderly dog is absolutely a factor in putting them down. Dogs aren't happy when they are being aggressive, add on dementia and you likely have yourself a very scared, confused and upset dog.

My dog is around 6-7 years old. We found him almost starved on a beach un Ecuador when he was about a year old. He was full of ticks. It turned out he had erlichiosis and we treated him with several rounds of antibiotics until it wasn't traceable anymore. We had him tested for all tropical diseases when we got back home and they were all negative.

For about a year he has been having episodes where I feel he's not himself. I feel he is afraid and comes to one of us ( my husband or me) looking to be comforted but when we touch him he bites. Then he snaps back into his normal self and seems distressed by what happened. Most of the time he is normal and happy and we can cuddle hin no problem. We have been doing dehaviorak therapy he gets sedarom tablets as a mood stabiliser and have been doing behavioural therapy, he is not in pain, we tried physio therapy and we did a full body x Ray with no issues visible. He is castrated and has been for years. We regularly go mantrailing and he gets 3 -4 walks a day. He has some food sensitivities, basically he can't eat anything orange, like carrots or pumpkin, but we have those under control and take good care of his nutritional needs. He is a mixed race 23 kg medium sized  dog. We are convinced there is a lot of herding dog in him.

Those episodes are happening more often and are getting worse and it's incredibly unpredictable.  It also not just a little bite, it's very aggressive, rage-like.

We are becoming hopeless, it's starting to become too dangerous since we have a child, we can't risk him having an episode when she near him. 

I just want to know what is happening and if there is a chance we can still help him become himself again. Could the malnourishiment in his youth have something to do with it? Could it be some form of early dementia or some other disease? I am so desperate I need my dog back.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/17jbjtk/does_my_dog_have_dementia_or_something_else/

"My senior dog is show signs of doggy dementia? What should I do?
Breed: Mixed (Chihuahua-Pomeranian-Boston Terrier Mix)
Gender: Female
Age: 14

I have a senior dog that might be showing some signs of doggy dementia.

She has been wandering around the house a few times a day, and standing around  staring in the space, forgetting some of her tricks, napping quite a lot, a sometimes having accidents in the house. She is eating and drinking fine, remember her routine of when to go for walks, and she is responding to her name.

I’ve tried giving her thing that will help enrich her mental health like getting her enrichment toys like lick mats, puzzle toys, chews, and retraining some of her tricks but she shows little/no interest in doing any of them. I even try giving her supplements to help with some of her symptoms. The only thing she loves are the walks and traveling.

I am worried about her and I am trying my best to help give my dog the enrichment and mental stimulation that she needs as I want her to live a long and happy life. But at a lost on what to do next.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/174hlv5/my_senior_dog_is_show_signs_of_doggy_dementia/

"Dementia in Dogs
How is dementia assessed in dogs.

I have a foster pup that I believe has dementia but the rescue says “she was tested and does not have dementia”.

Since I’ve had this dog I’ve discovered a heart murmur and that she’s deaf.

I’m concerned that if they didn’t disclose the heart murmur or the deafness to me prior to letting me foster her (they claim not to know she’s deaf), then maybe they’re not aware of the dementia?

Essentially I’m curious to know what a dementia test for a dog includes, and if they really did test her for dementia is there any way they really didn’t know about the deafness or heart murmur?",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16sc8rm/dementia_in_dogs/

"My roommate's dog is acting crazy, restless and getting into the trash worse than ever - I don't know if it's flea leftovers, dementia, or something from eating goose poop?
I honestly don't know where to go with this question and I've tried googling it but it seems like there are too many possibilities. My roommate's dog is an 11-12? y/o small dog, and although he's always been nasty in a more playful way, he's been an absolute menace lately. He'll bark at night when my roommate takes him to bed - and sometimes it's that he has to poo, but other times taking him outside to do his business becomes a gauntlet of stopping him from spending his entire time eating goose poo. He also just refuses to sleep upstairs some days - I'm not sure if it's just that he prefers to sleep in the dirty laundry I have on the floor down in my room. Here are a few things I think might be wrong, but I'd really appreciate anything anyone might have to say.

1. He recently had fleas, and I believe my roommates said he still has flea dirt. Part of his craziness involves scratching, and I'm sure that's some of the discomfort -- but also we've given him several baths since he was treated for the fleas, and we haven't seen any adult fleas on him so it's shocking if it would make him behave in this way. He's become more aggressive, figuring out how to tear over the kitchen trash can for example, which we never used to have to worry about him doing.
2. He is pretty old, so some of the ""feral"" seeming aspects of his behavior have made me wonder if he's developing dementia or something? I still don't think this would explain why he's become so much more erratic and wild.
3. He hasn't been going on enough long walks maybe? All of my roommates have schedules that conflict in such a way he doesn't get taken on as long of walks as he used to - or just get taken in the yard rather than full walks. But also, this change happened quite a bit before he was so restless. So I don't know if he would really get tired out, or if he would still be hyperactive because he's uncomfortable?
4. This dog has been eating lots of goose and turkey poo from the local fauna, and surely the poo of some other wild animals - plus he was frequently getting into the cat's litter box in the time before he started going crazy. His taste for gross stinky things was nothing new, but the way he now seems to forego actually peeing or pooping while he's in the yard in favor of sniffing for poo like a truffle pig... just makes me have the wild conspiracy theory the poop has something to do with it. Does he have some kind of bug?

I'm not sure if this is really the right kind of thing to post here, but I just thought I'd put it somewhere in case anyone could help and let me know if these behavioral issues could be caused by anything that's going on with this dog. It's gotten to the point where we're always frustrated by him rather than giving him and I want to try and help the guy get whatever it is he needs to become the chill cuddly gremlin I first met.",,,https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16pzct6/my_roommates_dog_is_acting_crazy_restless_and/

"Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…
We had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We'd take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he'd immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn't see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he'd start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn't really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren't worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)

One year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren't in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We'd try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he'd just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.

Finally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.

A week later, our dog's balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That's when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog's sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His ""sundowners"" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It's absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.

**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog's body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam. 

CCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don't want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.

Here are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:

In summary:

* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.
* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.
* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.
* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.
* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).
* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.
* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.
* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/

We have a 11,5 yo frenchie, who has had 3 back surgeries in his lifetime and double ear canal removal surgery last year.

They ran a bunch of tests, did mri etc and didn’t really figure out what was the source of pain other than “he is old and it can be anything “.. we have been able to keep him comfortable with 2x CBD oil and about 10 days ago started on gabapentin every 12 hours. At this point we are just trying to spoil, love him and keep him comfortable.

The sun downing seems to really ramp up & be the worst during the summer months, but is less severe the rest of the year (fingers crossed this still holds true going into fall) - not sure if others have the same experience with that or if it’s just our special lady. We are also a pass on the Gabapentin - but we’ve tried CBD & it worked for awhile but then just didn’t seem to make a difference. Now we’ve moved on to melatonin & that’s been helping a lot.

She’s doing ok now but definitely she’s not the same, she’s more disoriented and needs help finding her bowls (her cataracts are also a factor) but I had suspected something was off as her behavior change before and after surgery is very evident.

A combination of CCD, hip dysplasia, partial loss of vision and hearing plagued her in her last few months, and it was time to let her go before things got any worse. She was just at that precipice. Thinking of the next remaining years of my life without her feels extremely painful and unimaginable. For 15 years, she allowed me to be her mom. Now suddenly, the house feels so quiet and empty.

"My girl has CCD. For the first time, she didn’t know me this morning… 
My girl (14 y.o. pittie) woke up as I was getting ready for work as usual. But she often comes into the bathroom to check on me and she was hanging out in the hallway. 

She didn’t know where she was and I called her to me and she didn’t come. I went over and she was shaking like a leaf and wouldn’t make eye contact. She was backed against the wall. I got her breakfast ready and the smell of the food helped. She turned away any time I went near her. I had to lure her to go outside with treats. 

Usually she follows me to the door as I leave because I give her a bone before I shut the door and she stayed in another room. It broke my heart. 

Yesterday she was so clingy and climbing all over me and sitting on me - which she has not done in months - so I gave up trying to do anything and just let her cuddle on me for a few hours. It was the sweetest, best feeling. 

It was such a complete 180 to this morning. It’s just proof that I don’t know how much longer she has. I’m not going to let her live in pain, and I am certainly not going to let her live in fear.

,"CCD is often described as 'doggy dementia' (in layperson's terms?).  One common denominator out of various symptoms is confusion.   Dogs will wander or suddenly become confused in their surroundings.   Mine will walk around and insist on going forward even when she encounters an obstacle - something that is either there usually or something new - and she'll just stop and wait there.   They often don't want to change direction or back up.   

If there is some diminished eyesight and hearing, it makes it worse (the experience for the dog is worse).   It the most severe conditions, I have read that a dog can become so confused, it doesn't remember ppl, other animals/dogs etc.   That's pretty severe and sad!  :-(

I think she is suddenly clingy - again - because you are a source of protection and security.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fnl94c/my_girl_has_ccd_for_the_first_time_she_didnt_know/#loj4qd4

"Conflicted on saying goodbye to my 15 year old dachshund with CCD/dementia
Sorry this is very long but I need to tell my story and hopefully get validation and comfort in my decision.

tl;dr: My dog has dementia that's slowly been getting worse and it might be time to let him go.

Today is Wednesday and I scheduled a euthanasia appointment for my sweet pup for this coming Monday. He is \~15 year old dachshund and I've had him for over 14 of those years. Since 2022, he's been exhibiting all the classic signs of CCD: Pacing, getting stuck in corners, personality changes. He's been on a prescription diet, selegiline, and Senilife since the beginning.

For a really long time, his main symptom was aimless wandering and standing in corners. He seemed pretty undeterred though, getting himself out without assistance and carrying on his way, showing no anxiety. When he was tired of wandering, he'd get in his bed and rest. He stopped playing with toys within a year of diagnosis, but continued to play chase with the cat. Eventually he needed belly bands for his old man bladder but no big deal. While his personality was slowly fading, he was still essentially himself in my eyes. In addition to his cognitive meds, he was also on carprofen for arthritis.

A lot has changed in 2024. He started to circle along with his wandering/pacing. He gets stuck all the time. He had a tiny stroke. He started having nighttime anxiety. He needs calming meds (2 gabapentin, CBD, and a melatonin chew) to sleep through the night, but it's hit or miss. He also had to be moved from his bed in the bedroom into a round playpen in a separate room so he can get up and pace if he needs to without waking us up. He sometimes zones out when we go outside for walks and won't move. He zones out in front of his food bowl and it takes him a minute to realize what's going on before he starts eating. I have to hold up his bowl to his mouth to help him eat. He had to go off of carprofen in May and we were unsuccessful in getting him back on it (GI issues). We tried Galliprant and he also had side effects to that, though not as severe. He's starting to occasionally lose control of his bowels, and there's been a few times where we will go out on the weekend and come home to a poor pup who has pooped in his playpen and then gotten it stuck in his paws as he paced over it.

The last few months have been really hard for me. I've been obsessively trying to find ways to hold back the flood. Some things have worked and I wished I'd tried them sooner. Those things are Denamarin/SAMe, CBD, and Gold Standard Herbs Halscion. The combination has really helped his depression/anxiety and circling, and I'd recommend them to anyone else in this situation. But I digress. The amount of energy I've put into taking care of my dog has drained me completely. It's impacting my relationship with my boyfriend. It's impacting my performance at work (luckily I WFH). It's certainly impacting my mental health. I always feel exhausted and depressed, unable to really enjoy my life and feeling trapped.

After months of thinking about it but not truly taking the leap, this past weekend I really considered if now was time. Once I started to accept that it could be, my heart broke but it also felt like the most compassionate choice. I didn't think I was keeping him here for me, because everything I've gone through to keep him comfortable has been so difficult, but maybe I have been because now all I can think about is how much I'm going to miss him. It's also so hard because with dementia, there isn't an obvious moment to make the decision. I could keep him here longer, maybe much longer, if I really wanted to. We do get at least one slow walk in per day. He does eat his food. Thanks to the Denamarin/CBD/Halscion, he rests more during the day and paces less. He is on my lap now wrapped in a blanket, and it's everything to have him so close. Part of me wonders, what if.. what if we tried Galliprant again? What if we tried that other cognitive supplement? But I know it would at best give us a couple short months of only relative improvement. He's not doing the things dogs love to do. He doesn't interact with me much. No toys, no tail wags, no joyfully scarfing down his food or begging for treats. His essence is faded.

It feels like now would be the time to let him go, before his whole life is confusion and anxiety, while he still knows who I am and gets some comfort from my presence. It feels like we're in a compassionate window, where it might in fact not be too early and not too late. But how do I ever possibly go through with it? I am beside myself at the thought of him being gone forever. It's so so hard.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fp9c4p/conflicted_on_saying_goodbye_to_my_15_year_old/
,"I'm so sorry. I've lost 3 dogs in 3 years and 2 of them took extreme care-taking for a year before I had to make the decision to let them go. You did everything you could. You took the best care of him! It's ok to let him go now. It sounds like he's not even aware of life much of the time. And there's probably more bad times than good times ahead. It's ok. You know him best. It's hard, but what if's are so unlikely just to keep him going a little bit more.  It's ok to let him rest now.  If you're still unsure and you trust your vet to be honest, maybe call and talk to them.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fp9c4p/conflicted_on_saying_goodbye_to_my_15_year_old/#lovuhdw
,"You are doing the right thing. 

I'm not going to bore you with the details of my pet losses.  Just know, that making this decision doesn't come easy for anyone. A good pet owner always second-guess themselves. Why wouldn't they? They love their pets so much that they don't want to let them die. 

Now that you've made the choice, think about all the things that you need to do to fill his bucket list.  My biggest recommendation is the obvious one which is to spend as much time with him and take pictures, lots of pictures, and videos.  Some photographers offer free or discounted professional photos for dying pets.   Check out https://thetillyproject.org

I don't think you mentioned in your post whether you are going to have the euthanasia done at home or at the vet's office. I would highly suggest having it done at home.  The site below will let you search for at home euthanasia providers in your area.

I am really sorry that you have to go through this. It's going to suck any which way you slice it.  But you are going to bear the pain so that your puppy won't have to anymore.  He has done his job, and you have done all that you can for him. It's time for him to go ahead of the trail and wait for you.

,"I really relate to your story, I said goodbye to my 16.5 year old shih-tzu with advanced dementia on Aug 12. His dementia went downhill quickly over the course of three-ish months, and by the end I was so exhausted trying to keep him from hurting himself and worrying and medicating him and waking up multiple times in the middle of the night in a panic to check on him. I agonized over it for so long, because despite everything that was going on cognitively he still ate absolutely everything that was put in front of him and could go for short walks even though his mind was “gone”. 

In the end there was a day when I realized I could no longer leave him unsupervised in the house, so I picked a Monday, cancelled my plans for the weekend, fed him steak and ice cream and tons of other goodies, took him to his favourite park and was able to say goodbye peacefully with him in my arms at home. I miss him so so much (even all the fussing over him and medicating him and constant worrying about him) but in hindsight I’m so glad it didn’t come to an emergency situation where I would have to take him to a clinic in his confused state.

,"It is in the temporal nature of our relationships with our dogs and cats, and most any animal, that we will face this moment with them.  

We must remain strong and make the sometimes heart-wrenching decisions during their transition that they need us to make, because they cannot make them for themselves.   They cannot be left to suffering. 

And in the end, we must grieve their loss in our own way.  The depths of grief are a direct reflection of the depths of love that you felt.  And the pain you feel is your heart turning your loss into memories.   

The pain of loss will fade and the memories will remain, and remembering them, you will smile and laugh again.

"Dog with CCD
Hi everyone. I need some advice. Pardon the long post but there's a lot to say. 

So I rescued my staffy, Tilly, at 3 weeks old. I hand-reared her and she's been by my side ever since. We've been through 9 years of life together and have a very strong bond. She's my soul dog. Obviously, you build a strong bond with a dog when you bottle feed them every hour and then help them wean, your basically their mum. Then later in life I lost my dad (I was 21) and it sent my Bipolar into a spiral. She literally saved my life multiple times, like literally, she alerted the neighbours to me being passed out, she pulled me off a window ledge, and so many more things. She's literally lived every trauma, success, everything with me. 

When we moved into our bigger house, now married and with a child, we got a second dog. A boxer pup. She absolutely loved him. She babied him and washed him. They were best friends. 

Earlier this year she was diagnosed with CCD (canine dementia) and her personality started to change. She's always been feisty but she's started attacking our other dog (he's one now) and not even my presence can calm her, like it used to. We've had to keep them separated and its breaking my heart. Luckily we have a big enough house to comfortably do this, but I miss snuggling them both on the sofa and seeing them play. 

She's back at the vets Monday and I'm hoping they can give her something to help with the aggression. Its breaking me to see her so distressed, and to see my boxer boy being hurt. 

What does the road map from here look like? Are we near the end of the road? Do I have a tough decision in my immediate future? ",,https://i.redd.it/gm5j6f3gmiud1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1g2oaxb/dog_with_ccd/
,"CCD can be tough but it's manageable.  I had a dog live with it for 2 years, though his symptoms weren’t severe, and he eventually passed from an unrelated issue.  However, our most recent girl had severe CCD symptoms.  She would pace, pant, spin until she fell over, get stuck in corners or under furniture, and bang into walls- it was heartbreaking. The vets often prescribed medications like Gabapentin, Trazodone, and sometimes even Xanax or Prozac, none of which are specifically for CCD.  We only tried Gabapentin and Trazodone, but they caused more harm than good.

There's a common medication now called Selegiline (Anipryl), and some have had success with it, though it can have side effects too.  We were considering euthanasia when we decided to consult a holistic vet.  She recommended and guided us with CBD oil, and it completely stopped our girl’s symptoms.  We were fortunate to have another year together.  When signs of aggression appeared, we separated her from the other dogs, but the CBD mellowed her out, and the aggression was no longer an issue.

It may or may not work for your dog, but consulting a holistic vet is worth considering.  They often have more knowledge on how to manage CCD.  You’re not at the end of the road- you're at the start of what might be a long and difficult journey.  Finding the right combination of supplements (and possibly medications) can make that road easier to navigate.  There is a CCD group on Facebook that has a lot of information and people dealing with it.  Here is the link: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1273930059288831/?hoisted\_section\_header\_type=recently\_seen&multi\_permalinks=9471294166219005](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1273930059288831/?hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen&multi_permalinks=9471294166219005)",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1g2oaxb/dog_with_ccd/#lrqtjna
"Anxiety or CCD?
My dog has had, what we thought to be, very bad anxiety. At first it was only during storms. Then it was once every 2 weeks but lasting 1 day. Now he has gone 21 days straight with at least 2 “events” per day. It wasn’t until last night we took him into the ER when that vet said he might have CCD. We rescued our dog 8 years ago and have never known how old he is, but assumed he is close to 10 because he still acts and looks young. How did you all diagnose or recognize CCD in your dogs? What should we do?

When he has his events, it’s at any time of day and can be when nothing is happening. He will pace around constantly, scratch at any closed door, jump on top of furniture, and occasionally will pee uncontrollably in the house. Recently I have started to notice him staring and seeming to doze off (video below). 

[https://imgur.com/a/0G3LrIO](https://imgur.com/a/0G3LrIO)

Currently he is on a combination of fluoxetine and gabapentin but it doesn’t seem to be helping. I’ve seen other posts on Anipryl but not sure what we should be asking our vet for. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gzyz5p/anxiety_or_ccd/

Anyways, she is also on gabapentin at night for restlessness, keppra for seizures, carprofen, and Soloxine (hypothyroid managed since she was a pup) I found the generic 5mg of selegiline on Chewy and my vet said that’s okay to start with.

But I totally get how you feel. It’s really hard to accept that they don’t know/remember/do the things they used to love. It breaks my heart that he doesn’t play with toys anymore or seems to love walks anymore because those were his *favorite* before his decline. 

My husband tries to encourage me to believe that he’s still happy and fine doing the things he does now. Which I think is true, I don’t think he knows any different, you know? Because if they did then they probably would at least try to engage in activities they used to do. I think they adjust pretty easily because they’re such adaptive animals. Now I just try to engage with him on his new level. So we still do walks but I’m about to get a stroller. I will try to play with his old toys but if he doesn’t engage then we do a puzzle. He has not lost his love of food so we do lots of puzzles and mental stimulation with treats! And he’s a sleepier boy now too so I take in all the cuddles and how sweet he is when I can move about the house without waking him up.

"Pain, PTSD, or CCD for a 13 year old Chihuahua?
My wife and I have 3 pets: 13m chihuahua, 13f cat, and 1.5m chihuahua. I work at home so I am with the pets all day, my wife works outside the house and is home mornings and evenings. The cat hides in the basement since the puppy has been introduced. We want her to eventually be able to be comfortable around the young chi to join us upstairs. Dogs get walked multiple (4+) times per day. They also both sleep with us in our bed.

We found the younger chihuahua this past August on the street. When no one claimed him, we decided to keep him and he was neutered eight weeks ago. He is very sweet and affectionate 95% of the time, but occasionally will snap, go berserk and viciously snap at the 13m chihuahua and occasionally my wife.  He has now bit my wife on 3 occasions. Each time these bites happen if he is disturbed when resting or woken up. We will also have to hold him back because he has a tendency to redirect it towards our older Chihuahua if he is nearby. His demeanor always goes back to normal (which is very affectionate/tolerant) after a quick separation, but. We have hired a dog trainer who has told us that this behavior is because he is scared, and that when he is burrowed up or sleeping he becomes really reactive. we are working on training methods to lesson these responses, which will hopefully calm him down enough for our cat and our elder Chihuahua

The 13m chihuahua is our primary concern. My wife has had him since he was a puppy, and he has always been a very snuggly and affectionate dog. After finding the younger chi the 13m Chihuahua was diagnosed with pituitary Cushing's disease (which was otherwise not in full swing yet), and found to have some mass cell tumors that had to be removed (one in the center of his chest and the other on his rear leg leaving some pretty serious scars). These tumors were rated low on both of the relevant grading scales when lab work was done, and they had clean margins when removed. They also did an x-ray of his lungs, which were clear of any cancer and they did his bloodwork, which did not alert them to anything other than the Cushing's. When in recovery  the younger chi because the younger would snap at our senior about once per day, and as a toothless old man, he wasn't really able to defend himself. Fortunately we were able to intervene before any real conflict broke out. The 13m Chi had to get stitches removed 2 weeks post-op and did not take the experience well by yelling and howling throughout the whole process (he turned 13 the day after). Now, six weeks post-op and four weeks post stitch removal, our once very affectionate and physical chi is acting totally different.  The combination of the new stressful younger chi puppy, medical scares for the older chi, and a recent tragic loss of a friend, has caused an overall very anxious and sad vibe in our home since the beginning of October, which I fear is exacerbating these problems.

What was once a very snuggly, kissy, and physically affectionate dog has gotten very touch sensitive and will yelp, growl, and retreat just a few feet away when we attempt to touch.  This behavior is more pronounced in the evening, which is unfortunate, because this is when my wife gets home and she is unable to love her baby boy.  He will stand a few feet away from us, and just growl lowly, tail wagging. He will then hop up and beg to be held, only by me at this point, where he can be touched and pet as normal (he will also give kisses). If we are on the couch, he will sit in physical contact with us (either next to us or on top of us directly) but any attempt to touch him with our hands is met with the response mentioned above. We brought him to our vet, who did a routine physical, and ruled out any obvious physical pain through applying pressure to his body and joint manipulation. He had been in surgery recently, and so they had a fairly recent physical and bloodwork for him, and we had just dropped off a stool sample with no red flags. She also ruled out any cataract caused blindness and hearing loss. She prescribed Senilife, which he has been on a little less than 2 weeks, to help with any potential cognitive decline, and she also prescribed painkillers in case any residual pain from the surgery was causing this behavior. He was only on the painkillers for a few days, before she took him off of them to see if there was any change. I was out of town at this time, and my wife was their primary caretaker. During this week of my absence, she said that he was feeling and acting a lot better. When I came back from my trip, he started acting up again. Our vet told us not to start him back on the painkillers, but encouraged us to provide chewable CBD tablets (5mg / day) and Melatonin in the evening. With another week of no visible improvement, she has now prescribed Gabapentin in the evenings, which we started yesterday. As of now, he has not been on any of these supplements or medications for more than 2 weeks. Maybe we need to stick with the routine a little longer to begin seeing results?

He is still excited for food and has a healthy appetite, very alert, and has a good trotting when he is on his many daily walks (he is enthusiastic when we put on his harness, no touch sensitivity at all). He doesn't play as much with the new puppy as he did when they first were introduced, but I attribute that to the age difference, the surgery, and any residual pain he might be in. He does get very short tempered when the puppy wants to play with him, but they sleep next to each other all day by my feet when I am working with no incident.  I had a dog with CCD before, and she was not acting like this when she succumbed, but maybe this is early stages? He doesn't get stuck behind things. At night he has some trouble using his doggy steps (which he was normally very proficient in) but that has been occurring ever since the new dog was introduced, and there was a lot of early nighttime conflict on the steps between the two. Throughout the day he manages to use them fine. He will sleep cuddled in my wife's arms the whole night, occasionally waking up and going to the bathroom, or he will get up and growl at us from the bed (perhaps at the puppy?). He will then come back to his spot in her arms when asked. He has always been trained to use an indoor pee-pad for all of his bathroom needs and he is consistent in using them (when I don't take them out). I filled out a CCDR evaluation, and depending on how I interpreted some of his recent behaviors, he was either not suffering from CCD, or in the ""At Risk"" bracket. I have one of those cross body dog carry bags, and when he is it he is as snuggly and calm as he has always been. He is more tolerant of my contact then of my wife.

For our older Chihuahua we mainly have the following concerns:

1. He is in still in some form of pain from the surgery or from another source.

2. He has developed touch sensitivity as a result from the trauma of the last few weeks of surgery and overall environment of our house. We hope that this can be modified or will lessen with training / time / pharmaceutical intervention.

3. He is exhibiting symptoms of CCD and we will need to start some kind of treatment. I've heard positive things about ""herbal"" oil, as well as Senilife. I have read that Anipryl (Selegiline) is the only FDA approved medication for CCD treatment as well as Cushings. 

4. Some combination of the above.

Looking for any advice or anecdotes. Part of me knows that the treatments he is on have just started, and they will take time. But I also try and practice ""Hope for the best, prepare for the worst."". We just want to have our sweet old dog back to normal, or at the very least comfortable and at ease.  I have done a QoL evaluation, and he seems to be still very much in the healthy range. We hope that with a few weeks of treatment and training, this behavior will subside.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/17wyccy/pain_ptsd_or_ccd_for_a_13_year_old_chihuahua/
,"Is it possible to keep the dogs in separate areas while the older dog recovers?

How soon after surgery did the new behavior start? My senior chi who was displaying very mild CCD symptoms (just wandering, getting stuck in corners) HAD to go in for a dental, his bloodwork came back GREAT, his heart was in great shape but after anesthesia he immediately started declining and the dementia got markedly worse.

We did do a ton of supplements, Senilife, blueberry extract powder and salmon oil which did seem to help. We also made sure he was comfortable and had no stress.

We did eventually also try selegeline. We had poor results but some people report great results so maybe join some CCD FB groups and get some advice there.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/17wyccy/pain_ptsd_or_ccd_for_a_13_year_old_chihuahua/#k9kiv54
"It's looking like tomorrow might be farewell for now. 
I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, maybe just so other people keep him in their minds in the next twelve hours or so. 

This is Buster. He's 15 and a half years old. My grandmother bought him from an online ad listing when I was just a kid (28 now) and was told he's a full bred pomeranian. We've since conceded that we were lied to and his vet says he's lucky if he's ever even smelled a full bred pomeranian which still makes me laugh. 

In the past he's survived a broken leg, gum disease leaving him with zero teeth after a full extraction, and more recently arthritis and canine cognitive dysfunction (doggy dementia) as well as reduced liver function.

He's always been an anxious little guy, but it's constant lately - the pacing in tight circles, waking up scratching and whining at 3am, uncharacteristic snapping at familiar people. We started him on pain management and anxiety medication over a year ago now when he began urinating indoors - turned out he was just too stiff to get off the sofa in time to go outside! He was back to his usual shelf, playing in the garden, desperate for cuddles; but recently even his groomer had noticed him becoming more restless and fearful, and increasing meds hasn't helped at all.

Two weeks ago he ended up with two open wounds from obsessively picking at his skin - even without teeth he did serious damage to himself from a combination of pain and CDD. He was given antibiotics, steroids, antibacterial cream and confined to the cone of shame for two weeks. He healed up beautifully but the cone had to go back on as he was still biting himself like crazy. His appetite has all but disappeared- which is so concerning as he had to use slow feeders his whole life because the boy is ravenous. 

This evening he managed to wiggle out of his cone, and his entire inner thigh is red and oozing from his constant biting and gnawing at his skin. It's not an allergy, and he hasn't been laying in urine or anything like that. Nothing will distract him, nothing will interrupt him, and it's impossible to get the cone back on because he's so aggressive. His eyesight and hearing are both fading. He doesn't want food, rarely wants company lately, and just looks so confused and scared that it breaks my heart.

I think tomorrow I need to call the vet in the morning (we have a wonderful team at the vets we go to who make us feel so safe and reassured thankfully) and ask whether they agree that it might be time to let him go with some amount of peace and dignity. We managed to sneak his Gapapentin dose into some cheese and get him to take it and he's resting now, thankfully. Still occasionally getting up to pace, but pulling at his leg less. I just know it's a huge infection waiting to happen and even if we manage to treat the physical wound again, his spirit isn't there any more, and we'll be in the same situation but worse again in another two weeks. We had a feeling he wouldn't make it past Christmas, but I didn't expect to be saying goodbye quite so soon either somehow. 

My heart is breaking as I type. He's worth every second of the sadness, but this responsibility is the heaviest part of having a four legged companion. Please think of little Buster tonight, and let me know if I'm doing the right thing. I know I am, but I need to hear it from someone else too, yknow? Love to you all.

"Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome in senior dog
Hi all. My dachshund Levi is about to be 15. He just had a senior panel done and he is in ""perfect health"". But in reality he's almost deaf and has a hard time seeing, has arthritis and was diagnosed with CDS. My vet just said he's getting old and it's no big deal. But I just did a bunch of research on CDS and it sounds like I need to switch his food and add a supplement, and potentially take him off Prozac and start him on Anipryl. I also read that this condition progresses and that it's actually a super sad thing and he may die relatively soon, even though he's in good health. I'm just wondering if any of you have experience with this, and if you have any advice because I feel like my vet is dialed out.

"Cognitive dysfunction and frequent night accidents - any tips?
Hey all

I have a 15yr old Lab who is fairly mobile (does struggle to get up) but not really active. She's almost 100% deaf and her eyesight isn't great. She pretty much sleeps all day long but when awake she just paces around panting a lot. In addition to that she started randomly pooping and peeing in the house a few months ago but now it has become a daily occurrence. I wouldn't say it's uncontrollable as se doesn't seem to do it during the day and we mostly find it around 7am when we get up. She'll often step in it and walk it through the house too.

So we took her to the vet for blood work and urine and results came back normal, or normal for her age anyway. They told us the panting/pacing is likely onset of dog dementia, as is the frequent accidents.

Is there anything we can do to control the accidents? I refuse to put her in diapers and we've never used pads so doubt she'd take to them. We've tried changing her feeding schedule as well as limit water early in the evening but even if I take her outside before we go to bed (midnight/1am) and watch her go, she'll still have an accident by the time we get up.

If it is behavioral and not incontinence, could we try crating her over night? Maybe feeding her once a day? Any medicines that help with this kind of stuff or will I just have to resort to get up at 3/4am every day to let her out?

TIA!

,"I just had to put my 15 year old pup down and he was suffering from some of what you mentioned. He didn’t have pee accidents though. And his poop accidents happened when he struggled to get up. I don’t think changing feeding schedule would have fixed it. He lost control of his bowels when his body struggled. Sometimes it was a full poop, sometimes just a little bit of poop. 

I was getting up with him every 3 hours in the night to prevent this. Basically, he slept in my room with the door closed and when I heard his paws I’d get up and we’d go outside. I was very very tired the past 3 months. 

I do know other dogs have incontinence issues in different ways. And CCD can also cause dogs to pee/poop in areas they would never previously, even though intentionally and not an “accident.” 

If your pup already is taking a melatonin supplement to help her get through the night, I’d try that at first. It helped my dog a lot for a few months, and really until the very end. His bowel issues didn’t really start until a few months ago, and didn’t get back until his last few weeks. But the melatonin helped with the pacing and restlessness, general sundowners. 

I’m not sure why you are so against diapers. I got belly bands for my dog (male, peeing)… but since he didn’t have pee accidents in the house, never actually used them. The poop diaper thing for me didn’t make sense cause my dog had super crazy thick fur on his back legs, tail, and butt area. And he hated baths, whcih I already had to do 2-3x a week cause he was falling into his poop (outside) when pooping due to bad arthritis and loss of leg muscles. But a poop diaper is better than shit around the house! 

Suggestions other than that: keep your dog contained to one room (preferably with someone) lay down sheet or something in that room for easy clean up. I would avoid limited water, since it’s so important to their health. And I would also avoid switching up her feeding schedule. Loss of muscle is real in older dogs, problems absorbing nutrients, and with CCD dogs can forget hunger cues/pains (similar to humans with dementia) and think they haven’t eaten or they are starving. You may consider always leaving food out, or at least sticking to her normal schedule. Same thing with a crate, if she wasn’t crate trained as a pup I wouldn’t introduce it now. CCD can be frightening and anxiety inducing. I would pay attention to those signs. 

You could try urinary track health dog vitamins (basically cranberry supplement). Unfortunately, I don’t think there is much else to do. Maybe someone else has better advice though. Sorry for the rambling!",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/15x5obz/cognitive_dysfunction_and_frequent_night/#jx4kw3d
,"Do the accidents just happen when she’s sleeping?  If so you might want to talk to your vet abt  “spay related incontinence”, it can happen YEARS after spay surgery, often the muscles that hold urine in, in older lady dogs, aren’t as strong and the have accidents while they sleep. My girl is much smaller than yours, takes 1/4 pill and hasn’t had an accident in years.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/15x5obz/cognitive_dysfunction_and_frequent_night/#jx7byt9
,"I’m glad you posted this because my 12 year old dog has pee accidents during the night while we are sleeping. He will wake up and pace around and then urinate in a couple of the same spots. 

We walk him before we get into bed, but I’m thinking we need to walk him closer to when we actually go to sleep which can be a good 1-2 hours after getting into bed. 

I recently had 2 months off in between jobs and I walked him more frequently throughout the day and he had NO nighttime accidents! Now that my husband and I are both working he’s back to having accidents. Not sure if it’s due to us not being around during the day or what. We walk him twice in the morning and when my husband gets home he walks him, so there another 2 times in the afternoon/evening. 

I am going to bring up melatonin to our vet the next time we’re in. Until then I’m just going to try to walk him as much as I can and get up in the night when I hear him pacing. I started laying a couple towels around where he normally goes, but last night he peed on a small pile of dirty laundry 🥴 at least that was easy cleanup! 😂",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/15x5obz/cognitive_dysfunction_and_frequent_night/#jxejiqt
,"I have a 15 year old who was experiencing something similar. She started pacing at night and developed an attachment to certain areas of the house where she felt comfortable. She’s deaf and almost blind. She gets “lost” in the backyard at night and will start to panic and dig at the floor if she gets turned around in a corner in the house. All of this at night. During the day she sleeps like a puppy. She started to have mini accidents (diarrhea not pee) at night during the pacing and then when we’d take her out she would try to go but wasn’t producing anything. This would go on every few hours until sunrise. During the day she had totally normal bowel function and old dog behaviors, just a lot more sleeping. Off to the vet and now we are treating the anxiety that is causing the accidents. She takes low-dose anxiety medication (not sedation) at night and we’ve had success. We’ve also added cognitive supplements, calming substances, and senior probiotics to her diet. Overnight the change was immediate. Recognizing that we’re in the final chapter here, but our old girl is so much more comfortable and her anxiety caused by the decline is managed, which resolved the nighttime pacing and accidents.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/15x5obz/cognitive_dysfunction_and_frequent_night/#jxzkr9e

"Doggie Canine Cognitive Dysfunction
I have a 17 year old bichon who has been showing symptoms of ccd. I need your help Reddit! He is now defecating and urinating in the house more than usual (he is/was potty trained) but I don’t think he realizes he’s doing it, or either realizes it too late. So that’s fecal incontinence as well as urine incontinence. At night he sometimes (well most of the time) paces up and down the hallways which I have self diagnosed as sundowners syndrome. He does it in the day as well but not as much. He also has some fatty tumors, one humongous one on his side, we got 2 opinions from the vets and they both said it’s just fatty tumor. I have him on a cbd regimen from CBD Dog Health. I use the calm drops to ease his anxiety and the heal drops to help slow the effects of his mental deterioration. The family has all decided that we will not euthanize and will make him comfortable until the end. We take him for walks when we can, sometimes in different areas so it’s not too familiar, I try to do some stimulation with games to keep him sharp, I’m really trying anything I can.

"How many months/years of sundowning before you made the call?
Hi all. Just curious, for those who went through CCD and sundowning, how long did you handle it before making the call to put them to sleep?

My dog’s first bout of sundowning happened summer of ‘23. We started to manage his pain and liver issues and it really wasn’t too bad. He only paced in the evening and still today goes to bed and stays asleep for the night. However, the daily pacing and accidents have ramped up in the last couple months

So much so that my husband and I kind of had a dose of reality yesterday when we remembered how only in the spring of this year we decided we wouldn’t do any vacations or overnights because we didn’t feel comfortable leaving him with a babysitter or having someone just do potty breaks. And how now, after just the last month or two, we are like there’s absolutely no way we could leave him. Although he is manageable, he still requires around the clock care. 

He has started going in the house very frequently (sometimes 3 times a day) which is fine, really not a big deal. When he does go potty outside, especially at night, he will start rapidly pacing and following a path over and over again. When it snowed the other week he got stuck on this path and started barking for help so we had to do a search and rescue operation. This has been happening a lot at night where we’ll let him pace in hopes he’ll go, but eventually we have to call it and direct him back inside. I don’t think it’s just a vision thing (although when you call for him, even right in front of him, he looks off trying to find us), he’s just frantically pacing. 

This is in addition to constant pacing throughout the day. Eventually I can get him to lay down, but he will be restless for a good portion of the day, and then it happens again in the evening. 

I’m just trying to gage if I have blindness to these issues because in most aspects he still seems happy to be here and fortunately is sleeping through the night. Or if this kind of pacing and the accidents are worthy of letting him rest. 

He is on gabapentin, galliprant, and denamarin. We started selegiline ~1.5 months ago, not seeing  much from that yet. And I started him on senelife today. He’s a parson Russel mix and turned 15 in August.

,"We were at the point of calling Lap of Love to plan for saying goodbye, but we reached out to a holistic vet first.  She recommended and guided us with CBD oil and that was a game changer.  Our girl needed nothing else- the CBD oil stopped the pacing, panting, spinning, anxiety....everything.  We got an extra year with her until we ended losing her to another issue.  Maybe that could help your boy.  He's on so many things right now, which honestly, could be making the issue worse.  The side effects of many of the medications commonly prescribed for CCD are the same as the symptoms of CCD.  Our vet basically said cut everything out and give the CBD oil a shot.  If you have a holistic vet in your area or if there is one you could telemed, that would be a good option.  You have nothing to lose.  CCD is manageable, you just have to find the right supplement (or sometimes medication) that works or a combination of them.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gucdn0/how_many_monthsyears_of_sundowning_before_you/#lxtdflg

,"Adopted  my 13 yr old GSD in late November 2022.  Yes. We got her when she was 11.


She started sundowning noticeably spring of this year. She was already on Prozac since December 22 for severe separation and general anxiety (I work from home but need to go out for groceries, school stuff for my son, plus dog sitting my neighbors pups). 

Added in melatonin pm, then melatonin am and pm plus CBD oil. The CBD has made the most difference. She’s not zombified at all, she is her usual sweet prancing funny girl self. I’ve had times where I’ve run out of CBD and it’s very noticeable.

We didn’t leave together for long because we were afraid of what we could find even tho we Bella-proofed the house & yard. She wore a bell so we could find her as she paced. Luckily I’m retired and was able to give her the attention she needed. 

We loved her so much. There was never a sweeter soul on the planet. But, ultimately I was exhausted & she was so anxious despite more & stronger medications to calm her.

"Tips for doggy dementia pacing and lack of interest in play/walks?


My 14.5 year old Parson Russell Terrier mix has canine cognitive dysfunction and chronic pain (and possibly cushings but we’ve kept his levels at bay with medicine). Luckily I work from home so we have a pretty set routine and I am with him 99% of the time. He takes gabapentin for his pain and we see a chiropractor so I think that’s managed pretty well. The problem is that in the morning, when we used to play and then get settled for work, he now has a new routine that consists of him pacing up and down the hall for an hour or more. 

He doesn’t play with toys anymore, which is really sad because he LOVED toys and fetch. If I try to play with him with a stuffed animal he will bite at it and immediately let go. Very rarely will we actually play tug-o-war, and if we do, it lasts literally 30 secs if I’m lucky. He doesn’t play fetch anymore either. I’d throw his ball down the hall over and over and he’d never tire. Over the last year that changed to shorter bouts from him getting tired eventually to now I throw it down the hall and he just barks at me. He does have these little squeakers (emoji-like, from Walmart) that he also used to love, and those I can sometimes get him to play with, but again, he’ll chase it down the hall if I’m lucky. I can throw it closer to him and shorten the distance, and he might go for them, but he’ll just catch it or grab it and instantly drop it and just bark at me. 

I know he is not blind or deaf (which we thought initially) as our vet verified he’s good (he does have blue overlay on his eyes from fluid build up but he’s on an ointment and she said it really just affects depth perception and night vision). I try to stimulate him with a puzzle game and putting treats in a towel I wrap up. That’s kind of substituted playing but he will still pace after doing this. If I firmly demand that he lay down or go to bed, he’ll look at me and turn around to pace again. It’s like he’s on a magnetic conveyor belt, comes down, looks into the office, turns right back around to go to the living room. And he’ll do this over and over. I let him out in case he needs to go potty but forgot, but this will continue until he either listens to me to lay down or eventually does it on his own. 

He also used to enjoy walks and walk normally with me and our other dog. Now he will be the whole length of the leash behind me for nearly the whole walk (an hour). By the end he will usually get to our pace and walk with us. It’s worse when we go through the neighborhood, he’s a little better when we go to the park. He used to be such a sniffy boy but now I consider it a good walk when he actually stops to sniff and stays up with us for any amount of time. Idk if much can be done to get him back to loving walks again but thought I’d throw that in there too in case anyone has ideas. 

I’m about to get some CBD our vet recommended so hopefully that will help. I don’t think we’re going to try that one doggy dementia med on the market because it can cause GI issues and he’s pretty sensitive in that area. But does anyone have any other tips to get him to stop pacing and any ideas on other toys that he might go for or actually play with? Thank you for any suggestions!!

,"Definitely get him in some medication like Selegiline or Trazodone. Those really help. I had one dog on Selegiline when he was 15 or 16 and it really helped his (and my!) quality of life. Eventually I did have to up his dose but it saved him.
Last year my then 16 year old dog had a fall which literally made him senile. I put him on gabapentin and Trazodone and eventually just Trazodone because the gabapentin made him sleep too much. The Trazodone helped immensely when I gave it at night, when his symptoms would kick in.
I would have liked to have tried Selegiline but the Dr never talked to me about transitioning him over to it but he did ok. 
Please discuss these medications with your doctor!
CBD wont do much, sorry :(

Also, for arthritis pain, ask them about Librela Injections! They don't help every dog, but when they do they DO!
Also it alternatively, you could try Cartroohen injections. I've seen these work wonders on dogs, even when started at an advanced age.

A natural supplement that can help with pain is green lipped mussel.

,"Our senior Aussie has dementia and right now it is worse at night. I know from experience with other senior dogs we’ve had it will progress to the day time. 

We always start with supplements. 

All our dogs are on good probiotics to ensure gut health. Ask your vet. 

The next thing we use is Vetriscience PRO Composure. These are calming treats. I have found that only the PRO line works. Unfortunately you may be past the point that these may help, but you never know! You can get these on Amazon. 

We also use compression shirts. We like Thundershirts because the cotton ones are easy to wash. Our senior likes them a lot. 

I’ve also found she thoroughly enjoys her heating pad. Go on Amazon and search for dog heating pad indoor and there are tons of options. Most of them have timers and adjustable temperatures. Our girl really enjoys this. 

She also likes her penguin. It is a buckwheat filled shell that we can put in the microwave and then stuff inside a soft penguin stuffed animal. The outside is washable. She likes to lay with her head on it or with it on her hip. Search on Amazon for microwave heat pad animal. 

Lastly we use low doses of Xanax. We decided not to use trazadone because it was way too sedating. The Xanax is more calming. Our girl is 14 and I know she will be taking this for the rest of her life. Our vet told us it’s safe but check with your vet. We give it at night but we can give a small dose in the afternoon if we need to. 

We also do training. Our girl cannot hear anymore at all so we have taught her sign language for outside, eat, walk, cookie, water and business (pee/poo). She responds really well to these and we noticed where before she would not want to get up, now when we do the sign for walk and cookie she “hops” up and “runs” to the door.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1bhv05q/tips_for_doggy_dementia_pacing_and_lack_of/#kvqvghi

You'll need to see what your vet says about it. I gave it to my 17 yr old chiweenie at dusk so it would kick in before night. It helped a bit but not completely.

My girl doesn’t always know her name so I call her silly old lady names in a quiet baby voice. That seems to get her attention. I also started making my own soft dog treats. I give her lots of “cookies” and that seems to pull her focus away from pacing.

,"Some of the problem may also be from vision/hearing loss. As they get older the lens gets cloudy - kind of like looking through a dirty windshield - it makes them more cautious when going for walks and also makes it very difficult to find their toys, especially in low light. As for hearing, they have a harder time figuring out where noises are coming from, and if there is a lot of noise, they get confused. Keeping them close to you and touching them frequently helps. If they become hesitant, bend down and say let's go. When they are pacing or seem agitated, try distracting them. Brushing, treats, playing, ear scritches, kong with peanut butter, all work well. I've been dealing with this for the last 2 years, and while I know my dog does get confused just due to his age, a lot has to do with his vision and hearing.

"How did you know when your dog got dementia? 


I have a 14 year old Pomeranian who I love dearly, he's my first dog and I just want to make the right choice (my apologies if this is long) 

A few months ago, my pup developed dry eyes which required me to do daily eye drops. After a few weeks of this, he started to become reactive when I got close to him so I stopped the medication. Luckily, it’s summer and he no longer has dry eyes. 

In the past few months, he’s become more and more aggressive towards me, my boyfriend and everyone that he knows. It’s to the point where I can’t even put his leash on without him biting my hands. I’m not sure if it’s to do with being upset about the past treatment plan, but I’m also starting to wonder if it’s dementia/cognitive decline. 

He seems upset and confused most of the day and was the most cuddly dog in the past. 

He still eats normally, uses the washroom outside, does tricks (on some days) and knows his way to the park. He’s friendly with other dogs on the street but barely walks- he’s incredibly slow and has trouble turning corners. I can see his legs shaking but if I pick him up, he’ll bark loudly in my arms and try his best to bite me. 

At night, he lays in bed and barks as if someone is there when I’m in the other room. I try to calm him down but he threatens to attack me so I just try to leave him alone. He also stopped letting my boyfriend get near him even though he’s been in his life since he was a puppy. 

I took him to the vet, he thinks the sudden aggression is to do with pain, arthritis and cognitive decline. He mentioned the main signs of dementia are things like house soiling, pacing, forgetting where his dish his but he doesn’t do any of those things. 
Instead, he just has a total change of character- more aggressive, reactive, doesn’t want to be touched/looked at. 

All of my friends think it’s time to euthanize him because he’s a completely different dog than he was a year ago, but I’m honestly not sure if this is a case of negative conditioning from his past treatment or if he is seriously confused/in pain. 

If you could please let me know your thoughts/experiences with senior dogs with CCD I would greatly appreciate it. 

I don’t want to euthanize a healthy dog that is just upset, but I also don’t want to make him live in pain if that’s the case. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1e6lvt5/how_did_you_know_when_your_dog_got_dementia/

,"My 16 year old chi-mix also has dementia and I've been watching its progression for about 1-1.25 years now. Now, this is 1-1.25 years from when she really started showing clearer dementia symptoms (starting to whimper for no reason, starting to pace a bit aimlessly, neurological weakness in her hind legs, being unsettled more). However, even before that, the subtle symptoms  began around 2 years ago (age 13-14 or so). Those symptoms are like your Pom's current symptoms. My sweet girl, who used to let us carry her around like a baby in our arms, and who used to be excited to meet every single stranger she came across (when younger she worked as a therapy dog visiting patients in long term elderly care) , started showing aggression to my spouse and I. She would growl when we approached her face for snuggles, occasionally bite us, starting forgetting her tricks (she used to know a ton), stopped wanting to be handled as much yet was still clingy, starting walking past our house and not recognizing it, spent more time by herself etc. It was a change in character that we initially chalked up to old age or slight body pains. At that time, we got her x-rayed, full body examined, blood panel, etc and she had a clean bill of health so we knew her change in demeanor was not due to pain at that moment. But 2 years later, now today, our girl is very deep and clearly into the late stages of dementia. She now walks in circles, gets stuck behind furniture, can no longer solve food puzzles shes had her whole life and used to previously crush with ease, doesnt seek our attention, and seemingly has lost her volition/intent in her actions...shes almost like a passenger in her own body and no longer in control...I've been accepting that her time with us is coming to end. 

I wish I had recognized her symptoms earlier, when they first began. It was only about 1 year ago when my vet and I started coming up with a gameplan in terms of supplements/treatment/medication to help slow the dementia down. CCD will 100 percent progress in its severity, but the rate of which may be slowed if you take action. Even so, while we had managed her dementia well for the last 6 months, it still took a sudden turn for the worse this last week, even though we have continued the same program. Its the unfortunate nature of this terrible disease. 

My advice for u is to ensure that you are treating all the possible causations that are possibly due to pain (make sure her dental is good, and that she has treatment for arthritis if she has that, have her ears examined for infections etc), and if that doesn't change your dogs demeanor, you should start thinking about dementia as the causation. If your vet is not familiar with CCD, and many are not, change vets. Many vets just think its anxiety, and prescribe meds for those symptoms. I had to find a vet that understood CCD and that would prescribe me Anipryl/Selegeline, which is the only FDA approved drug to treat CCD in dogs. Our girl is also on senilife supplement.  That being said, the most helpful for us has been the introduction of Gabapentin, which both calms her anxiety and helps with pain  If you want a great resource on this topic, considering reading Eileen Anderson's book ""Remember Me.""  It consolidates a lot of info about dementia in dogs. My vet also provided me with great summary about other potential  drugs/supps that we should try throughout this journey. DM me and I'll forward to you. 

The tough part about dogs at this age is that there are often comorbidities. Their vision can be getting worse, there hearing is diminishing, and in turn that also affects their ability to interact with the environment and keep their brain stimulated and strong. My girl got worse as she became more deaf, and more recently her vision has gotten worse which also seems to have made her symptoms worse. She started having more accidents in the house, not only because of her dementia, but also because she started showing signs of kidney disease at age 15.  If you can, try to keep your dog engaged with exercise, training, or some other mental stimulation, to the extent that she is comfortable doing so...studies show that dogs on dementia meds do even better when they have exercise/stimulation. Lastly, please baby proof their environment. Consider putting down yoga mats for traction throughout the house.  As dogs progress in dementia, they started doing wild Sh\*t they never would have done before. My girl who used to train agility, would now face plant jumping off sidewalk curbs because she couldn't judge distance anymore. She also zoomied straight into a wall the other day.  My first dog that had dementia who passed 4 years ago, jumped through the rungs of our 2nd story railing, he survived but it clearly was not good for him.  Lastly, be patient with your pup and yourself and dont be too hard on yourself. Realize that none of the things your dog is doing, is out of spite or within their control, and realize that there will be bumps along the way and that you are doing the best you can to control the things within your reach.

"My dog has dementia/ sundown. What do I do now?
Long post fair warning! 

We went to the ER Vet around 10:45pm last night because we were concerned about my 17-21 year old papillon. The last few days he’s been bumping into things he shouldn’t be and getting disoriented. I was afraid it was neurological as a previous pet had also died of a brain tumor and behaved similarly.

 So we hurried to the vet. After a while the vet came out and said aside from an elevated temperature they could find nothing physically wrong and gave him subcutaneous fluids. 

When I received him back he seemed like my normal sweat old boy. He was alert and seemed to recognize everyone. Even my mom who came to support us. 

Now it’s 6:30 am and I found him standing between me and my husband. Not terribly unusual as he normally gets our attention so we can get him off the bed if he needs to potty. We have a captains bed so it’s pretty high off the ground and he can’t really jump down.

I ask my husband if he could take him to potty and he told me he’d tried two times already and he just bumped around the living room, but did still take him to try again. 

I got up as I wanted to confirm our primary vet visit this Monday and watched him. He did pee on his pad and then proceeded to walk in a kind of circle and start bumping into things he normally wouldn’t. The guitar stand, the kitchen table leg, the pet stairs to the couch. Things that we don’t move so even blind he should know. 

We are now back in bed and it took him about 20-30min of him standing, laying, standing, laying ect. And he finally seems to be sleeping now. 

I’ve never had a pet who was so old they developed dementia and Sun downing. As the vet said he’s in no physical distress. No pain, no heart problems, liver and kidneys are all good. No normal quality of life issues. But I don’t know what to do and how to support my old man! What would you suggest? 

TLDR: how do you help a dog with dementia and Sun downing?

Edit: unfortunately we had to go to the vet and he told me if it was his dog, it would be time. We already knew it was coming but it still wasn’t easy. Said good buy about 30min ago. I wasn’t ready then and I’m still not now. But he was. And he went from being in my arms to into my heart. ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1bb3g1w/my_dog_has_dementia_sundown_what_do_i_do_now/
,"I went through this with my senior dog. Keep in mind that wandering isn’t inherently bad. A high level of agitation and wandering is what you want to avoid. 

Stick to your regular schedule. If you usually sleep with him in your bedroom and have the door closed, keep doing that. If the bedroom door is usually open, try sleeping with it closed. If that upsets him too much, leave the door open and let him wander. 

You know how people baby proof a house? Dog proof your house. Look at it and say, if he’s wandering around, are there stairs he can fall down? Is there pottery that will fall on him if he bumps into a shelf or table? Just dog proof it. Keep in mind that bumping into things is truly not the end of the world. If it really bothers you, use foam mattress material to create “bumpers” on furniture. Do not rearrange the furniture. That will make it harder for him. Use baby gates as needed. 

Make your bedroom “home”. Have a soft, dim nightlight on in your room or close to the door of the room, so he can see “home” at night. If it won’t bother you, and your dog can still hear, play a soothing soundtrack on your phone or tablet for the night. I would play “Forest Sounds No Loop” on YouTube. Then my dog could hear “home” at night. 

I also added a bed for her in the living room, so if she wandered there but decided to lie down, she had a bed there too. 

She still wandered, but was less agitated, often found her way “home” during the night, and I was still able to get some sleep. Of course I checked on her when I got up to use the bathroom, and often she would follow me back to bed. 

If she was very agitated, I would hear her and would guide her back to the bedroom. In her end days she wanted to be in the living room, so I slept out there with her. 

Melatonin didn’t work for her. She did not tolerate sedative medications and they did not work on her as desired - they actually made her more agitated. 

She did not toilet indoors until very late stages and I used puppy pads. 

Sundowning is something you have to learn to live with.  

She was safe. She was secure. She was confused. But we got through it. You need to sleep to be your best self for your dog and your humans. 

Sundowning could go on for many, many months. Your plan needs to be sustainable. My plan was made in consultation with our vet. 

I wish you well. Pets to your beautiful pup.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1bb3g1w/my_dog_has_dementia_sundown_what_do_i_do_now/#ku788rz
,"I'm  so sorry . It's  a frustrating thing for the dog and humans. Prepare to be patient and loving. Mine would stand in corners and get wedged behind furniture and wander with no purpose. 
  If you can keep your dog in an area where they can't have too many things  to bump into or places to wander  around at night it helps. 

For sundowner's my vet said 5 mg of melatonin was allowed. But you need to check with your vet to see if that is ok in your dog's situation. I would give it to my dog at just after sunset/ early dusk do it would kick in. It was not a fix but it helped a bit. Also the dementia med segeline (sp?)  did not help my dog at all. Possibly she  started too late and was too advanced with the canine cognitive disorder.

,"Sorry to hear what you all are going through.  The frequent vet visits, life style changes for everyone in the house, and just slow dissent you have to watch every day.  It’s difficult to really step back and see all of the changes that happen over time as they’re all so gradual.  

We had a house of 4 dogs, all seniors.  We still have our little one Olivia with us but the other three have passed away over the last 8 months.  Our 13 year old greyhound had started having loud barking episodes completely out of nowhere in the middle of the night.  She also lost control of her bowels, which she never had any problems with her whole life.  I could tell there was some dementia or something like it towards the end.  It’s hard to watch unfold, but certainly started getting me into the headspace of it about to be time.  

For all of our dogs we waited until we felt it was time, looking at their behaviors individually for their bodies and heart to let us know.  They will keep showing up for you over and over, it’s your place to make the call when you feel it.  We had in home hospice for all of our pups, definitely was helpful.

,My 16 year old Yorkie mix has early dementia. It’s so sad and heartbreaking. She doesn’t have the sundowners but she would whine and whine after dinner wanting to go outside. So we’d go outside and she may or may not potty then we’d come inside and she’d immediately start whining again to go back outside. It was like she had no recollection of just being outside. She’s on Prozac now which has helped tremendously. We’ve also tried CBD chews which also help but do seem to knock her out. You could ask your vet about an option like that. She’s very easily thrown off - like if we go out of town it takes her a few days to readjust when we return. She also struggles on stairs and has problems getting on the couch and bed. It’s rough.

Selegiline worked wonders for our senior dog.

We were also told it would take up to 3 months to see full results.

"Tomorrow I put down my beautiful boy. 14 and a half years old. I lived for him. I don't know what i will do without him.
He's called Jasper and a few days ago we rushed him to the vets with white gums, found he had a 3.5cm tumour on his spleen that could rupture and he would hemorrhage. He also has dementia and arthritis. We have tried every type of drugs and therapies for those conditions and they helped for a bit but we've decided that it would be so cruel to risk the tumour rupturing and causing an awful.

He got me through some really tough times with my PTSD, he saved my life on many occasions. I just can't fathom a life without him.

He was the bestest dog you could wish for, I've had him since he was 7 weeks old, and he has never bitten, been aggressive to anything, never chewed anything he shouldn't, never went to the toilet in the house (even as a puppy). He was good as gold all his life and I couldn't have asked for a better dog, even without professional training he learned how to help me with my PTSD and mental health.

Oh Molly
You have been with me through so much...Recovering from intense surgeries, bone marrow biopsies, collapsed lungs, strokes, an abusive relationship, faith crisis, multiple bouts of sepsis, suicidal ideation, kidney transplant, grief, loss of loved ones and so much more. You've not only helped me, but every member of our family through some of the hardest times in our lives. 

You always found a way to make us laugh with your goofy antics. 
You showed me love when I didn't believe I was deserving of it. 
You were my constant shadow and confidant. 
You were the reason I got up most days. 
You saved my life, time and time again. 

15 years and 7 months is a long time... But I selfishly wish we had more time together. I use to roll my eyes at people who called themselves ""dog moms"", but you were the closest thing to a child that I'll ever have in this life.

Just like you've loved every version of me, I have loved every version of you. Even this last one, as hard as it's been, struggling with doggy dementia, severe arthritis, pain and health issues. But I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

The unconditional love you've shown me is a gift I'll forever be grateful for. I feel incredibly lucky to have known and felt this kind of love.

,"This was sent to me by a breeder when I really needed it. Please pass it along to anyone who needs its comforting words: 

“All I can say is that I know how it feels when a personal dog dies and that it never gets easier, the older I get. However let it be a comfort to you that the pain will turn into great memories of lessons given to you by your dog; lessons about love, loyalty, happiness, forgiveness, courage, humbleness, and zest for life and most importantly about yourself. I believe that dogs are God’s gift which he gave us so that we have a chance to learn these lessons from them. They are also here to give us comfort and encouragement when we are down. Thus our dogs are not just our guardians, but most importantly they are our teachers. And when their dog’s job is done, then they have to go to doggie heaven back to God. The pain we feel when the dog goes young or old is so great, I know. However, it is only a bargain tuition which we pay for these great lessons, protection and happiness the dog so generously and selflessly gave us.

Cherish these lessons and remember that your dog is not buried in the woods under a tree or in the desert or in the urn, but please know that your dog is buried in your heart where he will live in your memories as long as you do. Anytime you want your dog, he will jump smiling from the tall grass and remind you of the happy times which you have had together and will have forever.

"My dog is turning 16 in a few months. He is blind, deaf and has dementia. What should I do that’s best for him?
The only way he’s navigating is through smell, he bumps into walls numerous times a day, only likes walks for a couple of minutes of the day, and defecates everywhere multiple times a day. He paces around a lot, doesn’t know where he’s going and gets stuck in corners a lot. Today he was stuck in a corner and was crying for me to help, it really was a sad thing for me to witness. I have never heard him cry like that before, he sounded so helpless and lost. 

He still eats well, physically still ok (he still gets zoomies but with no sense of direction) but I don’t know if he is happy anymore. The only time I see him at peace is when he’s sleeping. I thought of putting him down but my mom made it like such an evil thing to do. I shook it off after a while, then came across a thread that said “But extra life no matter what is not always the kindest choice, if that life barely contains anything enjoyable.” and now I am rethinking things. 

Keep note that I have to travel a lot and most of the people in the house don’t care too much for him other than feeding and cleaning him. Do you think it’s best to send him off in my arms rather than wait for his body to fail him?

I put my Bessie (11) down on July 7th.  She had Cushings, kidney disease, a heart murmur and the very beginning stages of dementia.  Her final 10 days, she was eating less than normal, peeing every 2 hours or so, diarrhea every few hours and vomiting bile.  Her vet was on vacation.  Perhaps I could have taken her to the ER for more testing, more meds... to prolong the inevitable by a few weeks/months.  But my baby had already had her share of it all, and honestly was never a ""well"" dog.  We adopted her when she was 4 ish. 

I called Lap of Love on July 6th, she was euthanized on July 7th around 11am in my home.   I just didn't want her to suffer anymore than she already was.

,"Another vote for using Lap Of Love in-home euthanasia. I’ve used them three times and they were great each and every time. My dog goes to sleep in the comfort of his own home; my other dogs were able to see the passing so they had closure; last, but not least, I don’t feel guilty about blubbering like an idiot on the floor for an hour.  

It’s one of the hardest choices you can make, but if you truly believe your dog’s quality of life has diminished greatly, please consider doing the humane thing and letting them go. 

Spoil them on their last day. Go on one last little trip for them, if that’s their thing. Maybe not a walk if they’re not up for it, but I’ve driven my dogs to the park and the river before they’re passing. Home-cooked meals like hamburger, chicken, whatever. One of my dogs liked tuna, so that’s what he got. And all of them had chocolate shortly before they’re passing favorite toys, and favorite toys and blankets around them, it’s sometimes the best we can do for them.

,"I had the same dilemma a mere 9 days ago.  We want to believe our babies will live forever…or they’ll peacefully pass in their sleep.  I watched my beautiful, fun almost 18 yo doxie become blind, deaf, dementia ridden, fighting off infections, having to be given so many pills & shots, etc.  His body just could do no more - and I was so afraid his end would come cruelly.  I was afraid he’d struggle to breath, struggle to eat/drink, just plain struggle…I couldn’t do it to him.

It is the hardest decision I ever had to make.  And it hurts like nothing before.

But what has given me some solace is looking at his old pictures and videos (over a thousand).  I saw what he once was - how we laughed so hard at his antics, his intelligence, his strong physicality.  Then I looked at the last pic I took of him when I made the decision.  Although I miss him sleeping next to me, crying to me, and his dry kisses, I know he’s okay now, being spoiled by my mom and meeting the other babies whose owners are in this community- they’re eating steaks, guys!

You make the decision, don’t let anyone guilt you into doing something you’re not ready to do.  Our vet was fabulous and yours will not judge you at all.

"Dog with Dementia
My dog of 18 years, Abby, has just been diagnosed wtih dementia. The vet said she expects Abby to pass in the next 6 months or so, in her sleep.  Now she is getting caught in furniture and at times being unable to get herself out of a corner and it's breaking my heart.  I am like, ugly crying, because she got caught in the bed rail (that i put on for her because she keeps falling off the bed) and wasn't able to get free.  My heart is breaking.  When do I know it's time to let her go?

My MIL came for our son's graduation and was shocked at his appearance.  She kindly told us we should say goodbye.

,"18 years is incredible.  Abby looks so sweet.  I've had dogs with CCD live a couple of years with it and it was something else that they ended up passing away from.  I've never had a dog pass peacefully in their sleep.  My last girl with CCD was having really bad symptoms.  Our traditional vet was no help, but we consulted a holistic vet.  She recommended and guided us with CBD oil.  That stopped all of our girl's symptoms.  You can always consult a holistic vet too and try some natural ways to help Abby.  CCD is manageable.  For when she gets stuck in corners and furniture, you can take away those places.  We used throw pillows and bubble wrap.  Take away the corners.  They make bed rails that are mesh and solid- nothing for her to get stuck in.

,"This is so hard, and I’m so sorry you’re going through this. My dementia doggie passed away last year, and we struggled with the same thing. Falling off of the couch, getting stuck in corners, generally acting very confused and fearful. There was no magic moment for us — one day we just “knew” that we didn’t want him to live like this anymore. We knew that his moments of happiness had diminished down to almost nothing, and that most of his waking minutes were spent confused or in fear. 

And on the selfish side, it was becoming very hard for me to keep waking up with him every hour or two throughout the night (he would wake up and just start wandering around the bedroom. And even though we’d made the room safe for him, I still couldn’t just lie there listening to him walking around in the dark, knowing he was confused). 

Deciding to let him go was the hardest decision I’ve ever made. My heart is still so empty without him, and the grief is still very palpable. But I know that he wasn’t enjoying life anymore, and that keeping him with me was for my own happiness, not his. 

I wish you the best of luck, and peace in your decision. Make the most of the time you have left with her, and spend every moment you can making her feel loved. ",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gorjhp/dog_with_dementia/#lwmjv7v

I don’t know how to relieve his stress until he goes. He seems so concerned.

,"What a big, handsome boy Harley is!  Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) can be so tough to witness, but I want you to know you’re not alone.  There are two supportive Facebook groups you may want to join: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/CanineCognitiveDysfunction](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CanineCognitiveDysfunction) and [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1273930059288831](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1273930059288831)  I’ve been through this with two of my own dogs, and I know how challenging it can be.  Years ago, there weren’t many treatment options, and vets had little understanding of the condition. Thankfully, that has changed a little (there's still a long way to go) and there are now specialists and holistic vets who are more knowledgeable.

It was actually a holistic vet who helped us tremendously with our last girl.  We used CBD oil under her guidance, and it stopped all the distressing symptoms like pacing, panting, whining, spinning, and sundowning.  There are other supplements and even medications available, though I would suggest trying natural options first if possible.  While there’s no specific test for CCD, your vet can help rule out other causes.  

CCD is manageable and doesn’t have to be a death sentence.  We were able to get an extra, symptom-free year with our girl, and I hope you’re able to find the right approach for Harley too.

My beautiful Daisy had Canine dog dementia hers was rapid on set and it was heartbreaking. It was little things we noticed to start with like pacing and she couldn't settle throughout the day, then she would go into the garden and would just stand there as if to say ""why am I out here?"", then her pacing turned into 22 hours a day and it was full on circling and we would try and break it by holding her to calm her but as soon as we released her from a cuddle she would start her circles again. My other two spaniels would help her regularly with guiding her or settling her as much as they could when she was stressed with the pacing or needed help down to the garden or back they also took her under their paw. We would often help carry her to and from the garden as well so she didn't have to struggle

She sadly lost continence and couldn't find her dinner bowl so we would hand feed her at the end. We could tell in her eyes she was tired and had enough. When we had to make that decision it was the hardest thing we had to do but we knew it was the right one for her.

My vet agreed it was time at the end and also said he thinks she had a brain tumour as well sadly but she wouldn't have survived any treatment so we didn't investigate the possibility of this.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gbjc5x/dog_dementia/#ltnhep8

,"Our 15 year old Aussie has arthritis and dementia. She is also almost completely deaf and has trouble seeing in the dark. The hearing and vision loss are due to age. 

We tried a lot of different things but what has worked the best for her is fish oil, a good joint supplement and we loosened the rules on her diet. She is not overweight so if she wants an extra piece of freeze dried beef tripe she gets it. We also make all her meals (kibble) with broth. She has no issues eating but she loves it. 

For pain we use carprofen twice per day and we finished the loading month of adequan injections which we have been very happy with. At night she takes Xanax because she does get anxious and this helps her a lot. 

We just added in CBD and we give this to her on days when she seems more uncomfortable. We went with Ellevet CBD because they are third party tested and they have done clinical trials. 

We also make sure she gets daily walks. They are sniff walks so it is a lot of mental stimulation. She has become very aware and nervous when she cannot find me in the house so we use hand signals - your guy can hear so maybe try commands - to let her know what is happening. 

We talked to our vet at length about medication and she flat told us that using medications for dementia is the same as using medications for diabetes - it’s necessary. The Xanax at night changed her life during the day. She slept better and was able to participate happily in walks and we could tell she was less anxious.

,"Sending comfort and love! I’m so sorry you’re going through this. 

My senior pup recently started to showed signs of dog dementia as well and the vet confirmed this. He also came to us a few years ago with one eye that was going blind, which eventually became fully non-functional (and is shrinking, which is interesting). He very recently fully lost vision in his “good” eye, making him totally blind. For what it’s worth, he’s doing fine in that regard and can still navigate his way around 3 different homes he became familiar with while still having partial vision, as well as two outdoor areas for walks. Otherwise, in new areas, he sometimes is slow and sniffs around a lot, as well as sometimes walks into / off of things, but we are just careful. It’s of course a bit harder to guide a big dog like yours but it can be done. 

The confusion your dog is feeling will likely fade as he navigates the world with his new symptoms. He’s probably under a decent amount of distress, as you suspect, but dogs are super adaptable. All we can do is try to stay strong for them. You can do things like “baby-proof” your house so pointed edges or sharp corners in areas he often traverses are covered or even moved, so he has a clearer path. If he’s whining, perhaps try a calming chew or even talking to the vet about anxiety meds? My dog seemed to do well with CBD calming chews from the pet store. 

Best of luck! You got this. Remember dogs are strong and smart. He may be stressed now as these changes start occurring but he will likely adapt, especially with some help.

Edit to add: Mine also doesn’t get visibly stressed anymore due to losing his vision, and tbh, his dementia symptoms faded though they were initially mostly present in the evening. This may be due to other health factors but I like to think perhaps it was a phase or perhaps he adapted.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1gbjc5x/dog_dementia/#ltok9hg

"Dog dementia, arthritis and euthanasia 
My chihuahua mix is 14 and a half years old, I've had him for 10 years and he's truly the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love him so much. The past year and a half has really been hard for him as he has developed arthritis I believe and dementia. He's gone downhill really quickly. Although he is this way, he's not on any medication as my vets never felt like it was any concern. Yesterday he took a turn for the worst and was displaying concerning behavior so I rushed him to the vet and they assessed his quality of life and by their opinion think it's time for him to go. I have been thinking about this for a while as he no longer enjoys anything he does, can barely see or hear, and has anxiety and sundowning. He still seems to want to live and I can't bare with the idea that I would be the one taking that from him. I guess I'm just looking for any sort of advice on navigating when it feels like time, and if anyone has had a dog with similar symptoms which got better with medication. I would hate to put him down if all he needs is some meds. This is the hardest thing I've gone through.

,"My dog (15, also a chihuahua mix) has similar symptoms and she's on the max dose of pain meds 24 hours a day. They help some but not as much as I'd like. She has some heart and kidney issues that have been well managed, but the back pain and dementia are the things I can't seem to help her with. Yesterday I had a long talk with the vet and they recommended that I put my dog down sometime in the next 6 months, because she's kind of okay for now, but her condition is only going to get progressively worse, and her quality of life is declining. They told me that by doing that, I can avoid the terrible suffering in her final days that could potentially come about as a result of some kind of catastrophic event like rupturing a disc in her back. I mentioned that I would be moving in about a month, and the vet told me I should seriously consider putting my dog down before moving because it's just not necessary to put her through that stress. Honestly, I agree, even though it will be the hardest thing I ever do.

What you described sounds really similar to what my dog is going through. If you're not satisfied and you feel that you need to try harder for him before he goes, maybe you should get a second opinion from another vet. Maybe they will want to try pain meds. But pain meds (I can tell you from experience) won't stop the sundowning symptoms, are often only partially effective against pain, and very likely won't help bring your boy's quality of life back given that the dementia, deafness, and blindness are already isolating him from the world, and he's not very happy. Keep in mind that physical pain is only one part of the equation - mental pain like anxiety, fear, isolation, confusion, etc are all a form of suffering for animals, too.

Obviously I can't tell you what's best for your dog, but I figured I can share some recent similar experience and maybe this will help you feel at peace with whatever hard decisions you need to make.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1fjtbqj/dog_dementia_arthritis_and_euthanasia/#lnqh7lc

,"I have fostered and adopted many senior chis over the years and have been in a similar position a few times.  The situation with my super senior girl was bleak.  She had arthritis and very bad dementia symptoms.  She was blind and deaf when I got her.  We were considering euthanasia, but I figured I'd reach out to her holistic vet about it first.  Her general vet was no help.  The holistic vet recommended CBD oil and guided us with using it.  Once we figured out the dosage it completely stopped all of our girl's symptoms (panting, sundowning, pacing, spinning in circles until she fell over).  A side effect of CBD is it decreases inflammation, so it also ended up easing her arthritis.  It was like a miracle in a bottle for her and it gave us one more year with her symptom free.  She passed about 2 months ago and I've been trying to help other chi parents since.  If you have a holistic vet you can take your boy too, I would recommend it.  If you want any guidance with the CBD oil, don't hesitate to message me.  I'm happy to go over brands and how to give it.  It can be tricky and there are so many fake brands out there.  (I should mention at one point about 5 or 6 months before my girl passed, she completely lost mobility in her hind legs.  CBD can only do so much and it was more for the CCD/dementia.  We had to add prednisone to the CBD, and the pred gave her full mobility back.

We found our dog Phoebe (~16y.o. chihuahua) running around downtown in the rain on a November morning in 2016. She was between 6-8y.o. at the time. 

She was an incredible dog. Super sweet and spunky. Full of kisses and snuggles. It was hard watching her health decline… she got arthritis, then dementia, then suffered slipped disc, which led to nerve and neurological damage. Woke up this morning stumbling around and barely able to walk. 

The vet told us, when I asked for absolute best case scenario, that she *might* improve 25%, with time. After we made the decision, she told us she thought we’d made the right call, the call she would have made.

"Canine dog dementia 
Hiya my springer also has canine dog dementia. She is 16 and it's beyond heartbreaking. She circles continuously when she doesn't circle she needs constant supervision or she sleeps. 
To the parents of other CDD have your beautiful babies tried eating their dinner bowls at all?  My beautiful girl tries to eat hers after her meals each day today she nearly fell asleep in the water bowl. We have two other dogs her little rescue sisters who try to help her in terms of stopping her from circling or with helping her to find her way down the garden.

I think my question is when do you ""when is it that dreaded time"" it's beyond heartbreaking because we lost two of our previous girls over the last two years as well so knowing that we've lost three dogs in three years is so hard but we would never keep her going just for us because we always do what's best for them.

We've never had to deal with CDD before so this is a new one on us. In the past with all our previous dogs we had the normal issues such as the back legs and hips going which impacted them so much that they couldn't carry on and then one had incurable cancer so we knew we were on borrowed time with her anyway but the CDD it's so hard because she's like a dimming candle and she isn't how she was even a month ago and just writing this I'm in floods of tears. 

Anyway I would love to hear from anyone that has some advice in this area as I'm a struggling heartbroken mummy to an elderly 16 year old springer ",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1dadp7e/canine_dog_dementia/

The vet prescribed selegiline which can help but never made a difference for mine. 

The decision always seems hard, especially if there are good days with a feeling there's  still some quality of life. Then, one day, it becomes so sad that it's obvious that it's time.

He would walk in circles 90% of the time and would just fall asleep randomly. It got really bad in late April. He went down hill from there. He had symptoms for two years and had been diagnosed with CCD March of 2023. I just couldn’t watch him go in circles anymore and get stuck in corners. His soul was exhausted. It broke my heart. He passed away so fast. He was just done.

I give her Senilife, I think makes her a bit more active.

It took about a week for it to work and all of her CCD symptoms stopped.  I went into it skeptical, but it worked and completely changed her life.  For the next year, she never had any more symptoms, and we lost her to another issue.  The best part was she needed no other medications (until gabapentin for pain at the very end) and the only side effects were positive- slightly increased appetite and less arthritis inflammation and discomfort.

"Doggy Dementia
My boy, Ted. He's 12 1/2 years old. He has Canine Cognitive Disfunction...aka doggie dementia.  His symptoms started very subtly. Almost unnoticeable at first. The last month or 2, though, has been really trying on us. His symptoms progressed so quickly.  The sundowning is the biggest issue at the moment.  Ted just howls and whines to the point that NO ONE sleeps. The vet has prescribed a pretty good cocktail that keeps him comfortable for about 8 hours straight. We bought him diapers with suspenders to ensure he makes it through the night without peeing everywhere.

Just paces and paces and paces. There’s going to be a very worn spot in the flooring when she passes. She doesn’t really sundown, thankfully, but she doesn’t remember what the outdoors are for, or why she wanted to go out. She also has arthritis, so going walking isn’t safe because she can no longer get away from loose dogs. But she seems happy, so we’re just kind of monitoring her, and she wears diapers now to try to mitigate some of the damage to the carpet.",,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1by8ula/doggy_dementia/#kyhvsn3

,"Mine is a 100-lb senior Great Dane/GSD. She always followed her older lab ""sister"" and kind of never really had to make decisions most of her life. Sister did something, and she followed. We finally had to say goodbye to our lab just after Thanksgiving (I'm still crying at least once a day but I'm counting it as a good thing that I still have so much love in my heart for her) and it's been an adjustment. 

So now our old lady is on her own, and it's up to her to decide when she feels like doing activities or what she wants to do, or even to choose a direction on walks. We were so worried she'd be adrift after being so used to happily just following and not having to make choices. And she was for a bit, but now she's more self-assured at this age than ever. 

Unfortunately, it does coincide with a bit of sundowning, so this giant dog who's suddenly feeling a little pushy is now huge, pushy, AND a bit confused. 

We are using gabapentin 300mg as-needed, which is currently maybe 2 nights a week on average. If the weather is bad or the routine is off schedule, maybe a bit more frequently. I changed my own routine to be with her once evening hits. Where I used to be doing little tidying tasks around dusk, I've shifted to now be in my cozy clothes and just near her. She's got that shepherd guarding/herding thing going on, dialed up to 11 with the recent change in our family partnered with her feeling anxious at night. She just wants to herd us all together, and then needs to look at us for a good long while to feel like we're all here and accounted for and safe. 

One little random trick is we started ""tipping her out"" at the ""end of her shift"". Basically, we give her a little bit of kibble, like maybe 1/4 cup at most, and take one more trip outside to pee. Then we come back in and thank her for doing such a good job today and tell her she's ""clocked out"". I know it sounds totally ridiculous, but it's like getting your tips from the house at the end of the night, which flipped a switch in my brain, so I experimented to see if it helped her. And most of the time, it does. 

All this to say, you're doing great. They get confused, and just like with the rest of our family, it can be helpful to have a consistent, low-stress routine that helps everyone feel grounded, secure, and safe. Some nights are easier than others, but we just roll with it and do our best in the spirit of mutual love and loyalty to our canine companions. You're being a good pet parent by caring and wanting to make it as easy and pleasant as possible for everyone in your home, and that's already such a wonderful thing to be doing.

It's so much better to get it done at home, so very very much better.  You might have to save up, it was around 600 for us.  Know what their hours and days are and then you can relax because you did the awful part.

Sundowning is awful, yes.  You might look into Hospice options, they can do things that your vet may not be allowed to offer.

"help with senior doggie dental
hi all, i just joined this group and i’m so glad i did because i see so many senior pet owners going through the same thing i am. it helps a lot. 
writing this post to ask about what folks have done in regards to when your senior pup needs dental attention/ bad teeth pulled? the vet bill estimate is $3000 and the vet said he would PROBABLY be ok because his heart is still pretty healthy, but yes there’s always a risk anesthetizing seniors and she also said that with his canine cognitive dementia she has experienced that dogs have more rapidly declined after going through the sedation so that’s a possibility? :( 

the bad teeth don’t seem to bother him unless you really try to look in there and mess with his mouth, and he still eats his food totally fine (he’s on the prescription kidney diet wet food.) it does not seem to be affecting his quality of life to the point where the vet feels its an emergency and needs to be done asap, and i also worry about the risks and if his quality of life will decline afterward? just asking what others have experienced. thank you in advance for kindness and openness i know we are all struggling in some way trying to do the best for our pups.",,,https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1bkleer/help_with_senior_doggie_dental/
,"My two cents.

My husband and I rescued a senior at 12 in November 2023. She’s a Shih Tzu mix. Could eat but, her teeth were bad. All needed extracted as they weren’t well kept. Infections are the issue that you need to be most worried about, and the older they get the more risky the surgery and possible recovery.

We had them all taken out and her quality of life is better than ever. Cost was overwhelming; also around $3200 with labs. We aren’t financially well off. I do have excellent credit however, including Care Credit which many vets work with for an extended payoff plan. Paid upfront with Care Credit and some cash, then did a gofundme and recovered $2800. $2200 of which came from a single donor, (TY whomever you were.).

Focus first on the surgery. Then do your best to explore all viable financial possibilities.

Again, just my two cents.

Dogs can mask a lot of pain and I would not want my dog to suffer like I did. No way. Never. But that's my personal experience.

It is true that things can go wrong. One of my dogs surgeries had unseen complications that impacted him the rest of his life. We could not have known it would happen. But also I would not do things differently in the future. There are no 100% safe surgeries. That's why everyone signs a waiver.
