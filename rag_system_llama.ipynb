      "Page 2 raw text: 'During veterinary visits, pet owners are likely to report serious behavioral changes,\\nbut subtle signs, which may be indicative of declining health or cognition, often go\\nunreported. Family members therefore need assistance in both identifying andreporting any change from normal behavior to their veterinarian. Similarly, cliniciansmust be proactive in asking about behavioral signs.\\nThe current article focuses on how CDS in dogs and cats parallels neurodegen-\\nerative disorders in humans, particularly Alzheimer disease (AD). The goal is to helpthe practitioner develop a senior care program incorporating behavioral screening toaid in both the recognition of behavior changes consistent with CDS and theimplementation of appropriate treatment strategies.\\nBRAIN AGING AND COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION\\nMost mammals show age-related neuropathologic changes. In humans, the mostcommon neurodegenerative disorder is AD, which progressively impairs cognition,behavior, and quality of life. It is increasingly evident that humans, dogs, and catsdemonstrate parallels in brain aging associated with cognitive dysfunction. In fact, theaged dog and, to a lesser extent, the aged cat are spontaneous models of AD andtherefore can play a valuable role in testing putative AD therapeutics. Conversely, theknowledge gained from studying AD is highly relevant for understanding brain agingand cognitive dysfunction in companion animals.\\nLessons Learned from AD Research\\nModern medicine has increased the life span across many species, which in turn hasincreased the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. In humans, ADis generally characterized by initial decline in episodic memory followed by progres-sive decline across multiple cognitive domains.\\n1Ultimately this results in behavioral\\nchanges that impair social function and eventually results in death. Classicaldiagnosis of AD has relied on post-mortem conﬁrmation of 2 hallmark pathologies:the presence of senile plaques, which consist of extracellular deposits of ﬁbrilizedamyloid-beta protein (A\\n/H9252), and neuroﬁbrillary tangles, which consist of intracellular\\npaired helical fragments of cytoskeletal hyperphosphorylated tau protein.2However,\\nit is uncertain if either of these pathologic changes is a causal factor as several otherbrain changes are documented, including neuronal loss; cortical atrophy includingatrophy of the hippocampus; alterations in neurochemical systems such as thecholinergic, glutaminergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neurotransmitter systems;and reduced neuronal and synaptic function.\\n3Moreover, risk factors associated with\\nthe development of AD include genetic, metabolic, and nutritional inﬂuences, whichmay be equally relevant to pet aging.\\nRecent clinical and research criteria propose there are progressive stages of AD\\nfrom the preclinical stage (ie, prior to clinical signs) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI;prodromal stage likely to proceed to AD) to a clinical diagnosis of AD based oncognitive-behavioral status.\\n1It is suggested that beta-amyloid deposition may occur\\nearly in disease progression, followed by neuronal degeneration/synaptic dysfunction(measured by biomarkers of tau pathology or functional imaging). Both of thesepathologies likely precede the clinically identiﬁable stage of MCI or AD in humans.\\n4\\nTherefore, clinical AD is now considered a late stage of disease progression, whichmay explain the limited clinical success of therapeutic interventions (ie, initiated toolate in disease progression to improve outcome). Therefore, identiﬁcation of currentand/or novel biomarkers predictive of AD progression will be essential for diagnosticcharacterization of preclinical and prodromal AD stages and for assessing interven-tions aimed at prevention or reversing progression of AD. It is theorized that AD risk750 Landsberg et al'\n",
      "Page 3 raw text: 'factors, similar to high blood pressure or increased cholesterol in early diagnosis of\\ncardiovascular disease, will be identiﬁed and validated, permitting early interventionand monitoring of disease progression.\\nLessons Learned from Senior Dog and Cat Research\\nMost mammals show evidence of brain aging and consequential cognitive deﬁcits.5\\nCDS in companion animals parallels AD progression in several respects. For example,not all aged dogs and cats show behavioral signs consistent with CDS, yet subclinicalalterations in cognitive function may be present, which might eventually progress toCDS.\\n6Therefore, it is prudent to commence treatment early. Understanding age-\\nrelated brain pathology and cognitive dysfunction is essential to fully appreciate thepotential value of using biomarkers and/or cognitive status in the future diagnosis andtreatment of CDS progression.\\nEffects of Aging on the Brains of Senior Dogs and Cats\\nIn canine aging, frontal lobe volume decreases, ventricular size increases, and thereis evidence of meningeal calciﬁcation, demyelination, increased lipofuscin, increasedapoptic bodies, neuroaxonal degeneration, and reduced neurons.\\n7,8In cats, age-\\nrelated pathologies include neuronal loss, cerebral atrophy, widening of sulci, andincreases in ventricular size.\\n9–11Perivascular changes, including microhemorrhage or\\ninfarcts in periventricular vessels, are reported in senior dogs and cats, which maycontribute to signs of CDS.\\n7,9,12–15With increasing age, there is an increase in\\nreactive oxygen species leading to oxidative damage in dogs and likely cats.9,16\\nIncreases in monoamine oxidase B activity in dogs is reported, which may increasecatalysis of dopamine with subsequent increases in free radicals.\\n17A decline in\\ncholinergic tone occurs in canine aging as evidenced by hypersensitivity to anticho-linergics and decreased brain muscarinic receptor density.\\n18Diminished cholinergic\\nfunction is also reported in cats.10,19Collectively, these alterations may contribute to\\nworking memory deﬁcits or CDS, as well as alterations in motor function and REMsleep.\\n9,10,20–22\\nIn aged dogs, cats, and humans, there are similarities in deposition of A /H9252in\\nextracellular plaques and perivascular inﬁltrates; however, dense core plaques seenin AD are not found in dogs or cats, suggesting canine and feline plaques are lessmature than those seen in AD.\\n9,12,14,15,23Moreover, similar to humans, A /H9252plaque\\nload is positively correlated with cognitive impairment in dogs.13,14,24By contrast,\\ncats demonstrate more diffuse A /H9252plaques than either human or dog.9,12,15,25,26\\nNeuroﬁbrillary tangles are not consistently reported in either species; however,hyperphosphorylated tau is reported in brains of aged dogs and cats, which mightrepresent pre-tangle pathology.\\n7,9,13,25,26\\nOverall, both dogs and cats show A /H9252brain deposition and pre-tangle pathology\\nwith increasing age similar to that seen in AD progression; however, these pathologiesdo not achieve the severity seen in AD. Nonetheless, brain A\\n/H9252deposition may prove\\nto be relatively early predictive biomarker of CDS consistent with preclinical and/orprodromal stages of AD.\\n4\\nEffects of Age on Cognitive Ability of Senior Dogs and Cats\\nIn humans, cognition is composed of multiple cognitive domains that include not onlylearning and memory but also executive function, language, psychomotor ability,attention, and spatial abilities. In the laboratory, there are protocols to assess manyof these domains in dogs and cats. Age-related and domain-speciﬁc cognitive decline751 Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome'\n",

The DNMP is a test of short-term visuospatial working memory.27,30The test consists of\\n2 phases. In the sample phase, the subject is required to displace an object placed over 1 of 3\\npossible locations on a food well (top); in this case the cat is required to displace block Scovering food reward in the well on cat’s right. The second stage (bottom) occurs after adelay and the subject is presented with 2 objects identical to that used in the sample phase.One object (marked with an X) is located in the same position as the sample object. Thecorrect object is located in one of the remaining 2 positions (the nonmatch), and if the subjectdisplaces the object, it can retrieve the food reward beneath.

However, late-stage AD progressionis associated with impairment in most, if not all, cognitive domains. By contrast, dogsand cats do not show such extensive cognitive impairments (eg, ability to eat isretained), which suggests that the disease progression in pets is more comparable toearlier stages of AD progression. Consistent with this view, aged dogs show decliningCSF levels of A\\n/H925242, increased CSF levels of phospho-tau, and atrophy of the\\nhippocampus, all of which are biomarkers being investigated as early diagnosticpredictors of AD.\\n8,38,39Future research better characterizing the longitudinal interac-\\ntion among neuropathologic, cognitive, and behavioral changes in aging dogs andcats will be essential in better determining if and how CDS overlaps with ADprogression.\\nCOGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME\\nClinical Signs of CDS\\nClassic signs of CDS are summarized by the acronym DISHA, which refers to\\ndisorientation; alterations in interactions with owners, other pets, and the environ-\\nment; sleep-wake cycle disturbances; housesoiling; and changes in activity.40\\nAlthough a decline in activity might be reported, laboratory studies suggest thatincreased locomotor activity and decreased immobile time are associated withgreater cognitive impairment.\\n29,41In addition, signs of fear, phobias, and anxiety,\\nwhich are commonly reported by owners of senior pets, may be analogous to theﬁnding of agitation and anxiety in humans with AD and might also be considered acomponent of CDS (Table 1).\\n42–46Finally, memory deﬁcits, which are some of the ﬁrst\\nrecognizable signs of cognitive impairment in humans, have been identiﬁed early inthe process of brain aging in both dogs and cats.\\n30,36Therefore, learning or memory\\ndeﬁcits in aged dogs and cats would also be a sign of CDS. However, these aredifﬁcult to recognize except perhaps in dogs that have been trained to a high level ofperformance (eg, service dogs, dogs trained for detection tasks) or by highlyperceptive owners. For clinical signs of CDS, see the questionnaire in Table 1.\\nDifferentiating Medical and Behavioral Problems from CDS\\nThe determination of either a primary behavioral diagnosis or CDS must ﬁrst beapproached by excluding medical causes (Table 2). In the senior pet, this can beparticularly challenging because with increasing age, there is an increased likelihoodof concomitant medical conditions. Potential behavioral effects of medications mustalso be considered, especially those known to impact behavior. For example, steroidscan increase drinking, appetite, and panting and are also associated with behavioralsigns including nervousness, restlessness, irritable aggression, startling, food guard-ing, avoidance, and increased barking.\\n47Additionally, senior pets may be less able to\\ncope with stress, which may make them more susceptible to changes in theirenvironment.\\nThus behavioral signs in the senior pet can be due to medical or behavioral causes,\\ncognitive dysfunction, or a combination thereof. For example, disruption of night timesleep in senior pets may be due to CDS, sensory dysfunction, or medical conditionsthat present with pain, polyuria, or hypertension, as well as alterations in the owner’sschedule or home environment. Once problems arise, experience (ie, learning) furtherinﬂuences whether the behavior is likely to be repeated. In establishing a diagnosis ofCDS, the clinician must be aware that the characteristic behavioral signs overlap withthose of many medical and behavioral disorders.754 Landsberg et al'\n",

First, behavioral signs\\nrelated to anxiety, vocalization, night waking, soiling in cats, and aggression in dogsare more often spontaneously reported to veterinarians, which is likely related to theimpact of these behaviors on the owner. Second, behavioral changes consistent withCDS are reported less frequently but are present in a signiﬁcant proportion of thepopulation. Third, the prevalence of behavioral signs consistent with CDS increaseswith age. Finally, because CDS is likely underdiagnosed when solicited reporting isnot used, proactive monitoring and assessment of behavioral signs should becomponents of every veterinary visit involving senior pets. Veterinarians and their staffmust inform clients of the health and welfare consequences if these problems areuntreated. Handouts and web links on senior care and cognitive dysfunctionsyndrome can be used to further educate owners. Questionnaires are particularlyeffective for quick and comprehensive screening.

Accu-\\nmulation of A balso contributes to cerebrovascular disease, referred to as cerebrovas-\\ncular amyloid angiopathy (CAA).1–6Other pathologic processes that contribute to\\ncognitive impairment in CCD/AD include oxidative brain damage, neuronal mitochon-\\ndrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitotoxic neuronal damage, impairedneuronal glucose metabolism, and proinflammatory processes that stem from\\nabnormal microglial and astrocyte function.\\n1–11The 3 most common misconceptions\\nregarding CCD are that mild cognitive impairment reflects normal canine aging, CCDis not common, and that there are no effective treatments for the condition. Despitepathologic similarities between CCD and AD, dogs with CCD typically do not show\\nthe severe cognitive impairment that is experienced in patients with AD.\\n1,12This article\\nreviews the pathophysiology of CCD, as well as characteristic features and availabletreatment options. Most of the information in this article is based on currently available\\nliterature regarding CCD and AD, but the authors’ collective clinical experience with\\nCCD is also provided.\\nCLINICALLY RELEVANT PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nCCD is an age-related disorder similar to AD in people that occurs in elderly dogs.Age-related cognitive dysfunction has been extensively studied in the dog, and thisspecies seems to be the best naturally occurring animal model available for human\\nAD. Estimates of the prevalence of CCD generally vary between 14% and 35% of\\nthe pet dog population. Many of the reported estimates of prevalence likely underes-timate how common the disorder is. As with people with AD, the prevalence of CCD\\nincreases dramatically with age. In one study, the prevalence of CCD in dogs 11 to\\n12 years old was 28%, and 68% in dogs 15 to 16 years of age.\\n1,3,12–14In a 2-year pro-\\nspective longitudinal study of dogs more than 8 years of age, 33% of dogs with normal\\ncognitive status progressed to mild cognitive impairment, and 22% of dogs with mild\\ncognitive impairment progressed to CCD.15\\nThere are pathologic similarities between the brains of people with AD and dogs\\nwith CCD ( Box 1 ).\\nCerebral vascular changes, meningeal thickening, gliosis, and ventricular dilatation\\noccur in brains of both patients with AD and with CCD.

      "Page 3 raw text: 'accumulation of the neurotoxic protein A bin the brain (around neurons and blood ves-\\nsels) is a consistent feature in both AD and CCD. These accumulations coalesce toform plaques (neuritic plaques) and are most prominent in the frontal cerebral cortex\\nand hippocampus in both human and canine disorders. The most common form of\\ninsoluble A bfound in brain tissue is a 42-amino-acid form, called A b\\n42. In addition\\nto this insoluble form of the protein, smaller soluble oligomeric forms of A bhave\\nbeen identified; these are highly toxic and interfere with synaptic function.1–4,6,16–19\\nIn both human and canine disorders, the degree of A baccumulation (A bload) has\\nbeen correlated with the extent of cognitive impairment.20However, this is not uni-\\nformly accepted, and there is recent evidence that the relationship between A bload\\nand cognitive impairment is tenuous at best. In one histopathologic study of dogswith CCD, cognitive impairment was associated with increased numbers of astrocytesand microglial cells, as well as increased ubiquitin protein levels, rather than with levels\\nof Ab.\\n21In another histopathologic study, increasing A bload was a function of age\\nrather than level of cognitive impairment; in this study, the type of A bplaques was\\nsimilar to that seen in early stages of human AD.11In addition to the accumulation\\nof neurotoxic A bprotein in the aged canine brain, intraneuronal accumulation of a\\nhyperphosphorylated microtubular-associated protein (tau protein) has also beenshown. Tau protein is the precursor to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), another promi-\\nnent histopathologic feature of human AD. The absence of mature NFTs in the brains\\nof dogs with age-related cognitive dysfunction has been argued as evidence againstthe canine disorder being analogous to human AD. However, there are several poten-\\ntial explanations to account for the absence of NFTs in dogs with CCD. It is possible\\nthat dogs do not live long enough for the tau proteins to develop into NFTs as they doin people. Although the amino acid sequence of A bprotein is identical in people and\\ndogs, this is not the case for tau protein. Because the amino acid sequence of dog tau\\nprotein differs from that in people, this may affect the ability of tau protein to form NFTs\\nin the former species. Other structural abnormalities ( Box 2 ) found in the aging canine\\nbrain that are similar to those in humans include cerebral atrophy, ventricular enlarge-\\nment, blood vessel wall fibrosis, amyloid deposition (meningeal and parenchymal),\\nmicrohemorrhages (and occasionally macrohemorrhages) and infarcts, axonal degen-eration with myelin loss, astroglial hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and intraneuronal\\naccumulation of several substances (lipofuscin, polyglucosan bodies, and\\nubiquitin).\\n1,2,4–6,11,16–18,22\\nThe pathophysiology of CCD and AD is multifactorial and complex. In addition to A b\\ndeposition and vascular disease, numerous cellular and biochemical aberrations\\ncontribute to progressive cognitive decline.

Age-associated decline in the brain neurotransmitter levels of\\nacetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are\\ndocumented in CCD and AD. Of these abnormalities, cholinergic dysfunction seemsto have the highest and most consistent correlation with age-related cognitive impair-\\nment. Other neurochemical abnormalities identified in brains of patients with AD and\\nwith CCD include increased acetylcholinesterase levels (associated with cholinergicdecline), increased monoamine oxidase B levels (catalyzes the breakdown of dopa-mine, with subsequent formation of free radicals), and increased cerebrospinal fluid\\n(CSF) levels of lactate, pyruvate, and potassium.\\nMitochondrial dysfunction is a central theme in the development and progression of\\nAD/CCD. Mitochondria produce ATP via the electron transport chain and are respon-\\nsible for providing most of the cellular energy requirements. In AD/CCD, mitochondria\\nundergo both morphologic and functional changes (including mitochondrial geneexpression), some of which are attributed to A bdeposition. In general, mitochondrial\\nfunction declines in AD/CCD. In addition to their role in cellular energy production in\\nbrain cells, the mitochondria have a proteostatic ability to decrease the toxic effectof Abon cellular function that diminishes as mitochondrial function declines. In addi-\\ntion, and related to, decreased mitochondrial ability to generate cellular energy, the\\nCCD/AD brain has a diminished capacity to metabolize glucose. Glucose is themain energy substrate for neurons in the brain, and neurons affected by AD/CCDare impaired in both uptake and use of glucose.\\n1–11,23,24\\nAn imbalance in the levels of neuroexcitatory versus neuroinhibitory neurotransmis-\\nsion in the brain has been documented in animal models and patients with AD.Neuronal hyperexcitability is thought to contribute to cognitive decline in patients\\nwith AD. Excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors in AD/CCD contributes to\\nneuronal excitotoxicity and death. In addition, there is evidence that impaired functionof inhibitory interneurons is an important facet of abnormal neural networks in the AD\\nbrain. These abnormalities of synaptic plasticity have been correlated with A bdepo-\\nsition and mitochondrial dysfunction.\\n4,7,8\\nAs previously mentioned, there are several misconceptions regarding CCD that are\\noften held by both dog owners and members of the veterinary community. These mis-\\nconceptions likely contribute to misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of CCD, as well\\nas undertreatment of the disorder. Pet owners often regard development of clinicalsigns of cognitive dysfunction, especially subtle early signs, as part of the normal ag-\\ning process. CCD is a common disorder, and it often progresses from mild to more\\nsevere cognitive impairment. As cognitive ability progressively declines in patientswith CCD, it is common for owners to assume that the outlook is hopeless and that\\nnothing can be done. Although there are striking similarities between CCD and AD\\nin terms of pathophysiologic characteristics and mechanisms, there are some impor-tant differences regarding disease severity, rate and extent of progression, and soci-\\netal roles of the affected individual. Dogs with CCD tend to have less severe levels of\\nAb-associated brain disorder than are observed in patients with AD, and are less likely\\nto develop such severe impairment as occurs in people with AD.\\n1,11,14,15Patients with\\nCCD typically respond well to medical intervention, especially if instituted early in the\\ndisease process, and the interventions typically applied have little to no adverse effect.\\nThere is also evidence in both AD and CCD that preventive measures (eg, dietDewey et al 4'\n",

Although it is useful to compare disease mechanistic processes between AD and\\nCCD, veterinarians should also view CCD as a distinct disorder in its own right when\\nconsidering treatment options and prognosis.\\nIn consideration of the potential benefits of early intervention in CCD management,\\nnote that clinically inapparent cognitive decline has been documented to occur in\\nsome dogs before 8 years of age. Using specific behavioral testing tools, early cogni-tive impairment has been documented in beagles as young as 6 years old.\\n1,3,6,11–15\\nThe same type of testing used in another study showed that young to middle-aged\\n(1.5–7 years old) beagle dogs with increased CSF A bconcentrations showed learning\\ndeficits, compared with dogs with low CSF A bconcentrations.25Histopathologically\\nobservable brain A bdeposits do not develop in dogs until age 8 or 9 years.16,25\\nThis information suggests that simple preventive measures against CCD (eg, dietary\\nsupplements, as discussed later) may be generally advisable in pet dogs as theynear middle age.\\nSIGNALMENT, HISTORY, AND CLINICAL SIGNS\\nThe typical scenario of CCD is an elderly dog (often >8 years of age) with slowly pro-gressive cognitive decline, usually over a period of at least several months. In addition\\nto advancing age, other reported risk factors for developing CCD include sex (females\\nat highest risk, spayed/neutered at higher risk than intact dogs) and body size (smallerdogs at higher risk than larger dogs); however, other reports have not found associa-\\ntions between sex or body size and the likelihood of developing CCD.\\n1–4,6,11–14,24,26,27\\nOne study found a significant association between idiopathic epilepsy and early-age\\nonset of CCD in dogs; this is similar to people, in which there is an established relation-\\nship between temporal lobe epilepsy and early-onset AD.28,29The 4 main historical (ie,\\nderived from the owner) clinical features of cognitive impairment are apparent confu-sion, anxiety, disturbance of the sleep/wake cycle (sleeping during the day, restless at\\nnight), and decreased interaction of the pet with the owners Box 3 .\\n26\\nIn addition to these main features of CCD, historical complaints regarding the dis-\\norder are numerous and often nonspecific ( Box 4 ). They include inattentiveness, inac-\\ntivity, aimless wandering (often pacing at night), demented behavior, urinary and/or\\nfecal incontinence (posturing normally, but voiding in inappropriate locations), diffi-\\nculty navigating stairs, attempting to pass through narrow spaces (like the hinge re-gion of a door), inability to locate dropped food, becoming lost in previously familiar\\nenvironments, failure to recognize previously familiar people or animals, decreased\\ninteraction with family members, apparent hearing loss, and excessive vocalization\\nBox 3\\nFour main owner observations given in history\\nApparent confusion\\nAnxietyDisturbance of sleep/wake cycleDecreased interaction of the pet with ownersCanine Cognitive Dysfunction 5'\n",

Several useful and accurate behavioral tests\\nhave been developed that can objectively measure canine cognitive ability and deficitsthereof in a laboratory setting. These tests include the delayed nonmatching to posi-\\ntion (DNMP) memory task, and the attention task. The DNMP task evaluates short-\\nterm visuospatial memory, and the attention task tests selective attention.\\n1,3,4Such\\ntests have been, and remain, essential tools for CCD research but are not practical\\nin a busy clinical setting. Other, more rapidly performed, cognitive tests (a food-\\nsearching [FS] task and problem-solving task) have been evaluated for clinical use,with the FS task showing the most promise.\\n32Pivotal to a correct diagnosis of CCD\\nis an accurate and comprehensive history from the pet owner. Clinicians must have\\na high index of suspicion for CCD in older dogs. In addition, specific questions\\nregarding the patient’s behavior need to be posed to the dog owner with suspectedCCD. Owners often do not volunteer potentially useful historical behavioral observa-\\ntions, either because they do not associate them with the overall clinical picture or\\nbecause they attribute them to signs of normal dog aging.\\nThe only imaging modality of practical use for the diagnosis of CCD is MRI. Owners\\nof dogs with CCD often elect not to pursue MRI, because of several factors. These fac-\\ntors include concerns over general anesthesia in a geriatric pet, costs associated withMRI, and the low likelihood that an MRI diagnosis will contribute meaningfully to the\\ntreatment plan. Because of this understandable reticence of owners to pursue MRI\\nin dogs suspected of having CCD, the literature on MRI features of CCD is sparsecompared with that available for AD. Brain imaging of patients with AD can be normalor may reveal brain atrophy, ventricular enlargement, and lesions in the medial tempo-\\nral lobes of the cerebral cortex. Age-related changes appreciated on MRI of the brain\\nin patients with CCD are primarily reflective of brain atrophy and include ventricularenlargement as well as widened and well-demarcated cerebral sulci. Although these\\nare consistent findings associated with the aging brain, they can also be found in\\nsome older patients without evidence of CCD.\\n4Periventricular white matter hyperin-\\ntensities, also referred to as leukoaraiosis, are thought to be caused by vascular ab-\\nnormalities of the arterioles in this region of the brain; in people, they have been\\nassociated with AD and other vascular brain disorders. Similar periventricular hyper-intense regions have also been described in elderly dogs ( Fig. 1 ).\\nIn one report of 14 elderly dogs with suspected leukoaraiosis on MRI, a progressive\\ndecrease in interthalamic adhesion thickness was shown for 3 dogs for which serial\\nFig. 1.

The addition of carotenoids and flavo-noids as natural antioxidants from fruits, and particularly vegetables, has been asso-\\nciated with improvements in CCD.\\n4,45,46,49–51These antioxidants are much more than\\njust antioxidant in their actions. They can also act as mitochondrial cofactors and in-crease cellular endogenous antioxidant upregulation.\\n52Therapeutic approaches using\\nMCTs and natural antioxidants with essential vitamins and minerals seem to be effec-\\ntive. The 2 commercial CCD diets with the most evidence of efficacy are Hills b/d andPurina One Vibrant Maturity 7 1formula in clinical trials of CCD.

The AD/CCD brain has an impaired ability to useglucose, the brain’s main energy source; MCTs provide an alternative energy source\\nfor the brain in cognitively impaired patients. These ketone bodies are rapidly con-\\nverted to glucose precursors through interactions of astrocytes and glial cells withthe surrounding neurons. MCTs may also improve brain mitochondrial activity anddecrease the level of brain amyloid precursor protein.\\n4,54MCTs are commonly\\nincluded in ketogenic diets for both people and dogs. In one study, a proprietary\\nmix of MCTs was shown to improve cognitive function in aged beagle dogs whenincorporated into commercial food at 5% of the dry matter.\\n55\\nAlthough the underlying premise regarding MCTs generating alternative energy\\nsources for neurons through astrocyte metabolic alteration holds validity in humans,the premise is suspect in dogs. In humans there is considerable generation of\\nb-hydroxybutyrate during metabolism of MCTs, whereas in dogs the generation of\\nb-hydroxybutyrate is obscure, being between 20% and 70% of what is observed in\\npeople.\\n55–57The lack of consistent ketone generation suggests that other mecha-\\nnisms may play a role and it has been shown that the individual medium-chain fatty\\nacids that increase in the bloodstream of rodents and people can affect neuronal func-\\ntion. The MCTs generally discussed are decanoic acid (10 carbons long, also knownas capric acid) and octanoic acid (8 carbons long, also known as caprylic acid).

This amount of coconut or MCT oil addi-\\ntion provides between 10% and 5% of the caloric content of the diet respectively.

In the resting state, severalfrontal and temporal regions (cognitive-related regions) showed decreased hippo-\\ncampal connectivity in patients with AD relative to control subjects. Following\\nacupuncture, patients with AD showed increased connectivity in most of thehippocampal-related regions.\\n110\\nSUMMARY\\nCCD is a common neurodegenerative condition of aging dogs with many similarities toAD of people. The pathophysiology of CCD/AD is multifaceted, involving many inter-related biochemical aberrations. Central to the development of CCD/AD are compro-\\nmised brain vasculature and the deposition in the brain parenchyma of a toxic protein\\ncalled A b. These two central processes are intertwined, because each can promote\\nprogression of the other. Although dogs with CCD are typically recognized as showingcognitive impairment by 8 years or older, there is considerable evidence that the pro-\\ncesses leading to this clinical state begin earlier in life. Pet owners and veterinarians\\nshould therefore consider preventive measures against the development of CCDwhen dogs are middle aged. Diagnosis of CCD often depends on an accurate history\\nof the patient’s clinical progression, derived from the dog owner. It is important for vet-\\nerinarians to maintain a high index of suspicion for CCD and ask the right questions. Itis important for dog owners and veterinarians to realize that cognitive impairment or\\nsenility should not be considered a normal part of the canine aging process. Because\\nCCD-suspect dogs tend to be elderly, other disease processes that could mimic CCDneed to be ruled out. Although not commonly pursued, brain MRI of dogs with CCDusually shows a small interthalamic adhesion thickness. Dogs with CCD usually do\\nnot reach the same level of disease severity as their human AD counterparts. These\\npatients also usually respond well to therapeutic interventions and often have agood long-term quality of life. Several therapeutic approaches have been shown to\\nbe effective in treating CCD, principal among them being dietary modulations, a vari-\\nety of nutraceutical supplements, and cognitive enrichment. The anticonvulsant druglevetiracetam has been shown to be effective in experimental models of AD as well as\\nhuman AD clinical trials in improving cognitive function. This therapy should be\\nconsidered for treatment of CCD as well.

Although\\ntheﬁrst primarily reacts to real or perceived stressful life events and\\nthe least responds to viruses, bacteria and parasites, they are\\nbiologically connected to each other, acting together in order to\\nmaintain or re-establish homeostasis.\\nThe cross-talk between these two systems is more studied in the\\ncontext of stress responses that involve primarily the activation of\\nhypothalamus –pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis resulting in release of\\ncathecolamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and glucocorticoids\\nfrom medullar and cortical regions of adrenal, respectively ( Steinman,\\n2004 ).\\nImmune cells have different sets of receptors for different products\\nsecreted by activated HPA axis, and these neuroendocrine products\\nhave the potential to in ﬂuence immune function ( Butts and Sternberg,2008; Padgett and Glaser, 2003 ). Although the activation of HPA axis\\nis fundamental for the adaptive response to stress, if the stressor is\\nexcessive or prolonged, adaptations can increase the risk of\\nimmunological disorders, such as those observed in patients suffering\\nof generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).\\nThe GAD is often a debilitating chronic condition, characterized by\\nlong-lasting anxiety that is not focused on any object or situation. In\\ntimes of high stress, GAD patients frequently present some physio-\\nlogical symptoms such as headache, sweating, muscle spasms,\\npalpitations, and hypertension, which in some cases lead to fatigue\\nor even exhaustion ( Khouzam, 2009 ).\\nMany studies have demonstrated that chronic anxiety state has also a\\ndeleterious impact on immune function ( Boscarino, 2004; Sareen et al.,\\n2005; Schneiderman et al., 2005; Godbout and Glaser, 2006 ). Authors\\nhave demonstrated that anxiety can lead to damaged cellular and\\nhumoral immune responses ( Arranz et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2005; Koh\\nand Lee, 2004 ), and, consequently, increase the incidence of viral and\\nbacterial infections ( Takkouche et al., 2001; Aviles et al., 2004; Cohen\\net al., 1999 ). Anxiety has also been related to impaired immune response\\nto several antiviral/bacterial vaccines, such as hepatitis B virus ( Glaser\\net al., 1992; Jabaaij et al., 1996 ), pneumococcal bacteria ( Glaser et al.\\n2000 ), rubella virus ( Morag et al. 1999 ), meningitis virus ( Burns et al.Journal of Neuroimmunology 229 (2010) 212 –218\\n⁎Corresponding author.

In this context, Th1-mediated response is character-\\nized by the production of IL-2 and IFN- γand is involved in cellular\\nimmunity against intracellular microorganisms ( Gutcher and Becher,\\n2007 ). These cytokines activate the bactericidal activities of macro-\\nphages, induce opsonizing IgG1 and IgG3 secretion by B cells, mobilize\\nand enhance the cytotoxic activities of CD8+T cells and NK cells\\n(Crozat et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, human Th2 cells produce IL-4,\\nIL-5, and IL-13 and are required to control helminthes infections by\\nstimulating the growth and activation of mast cells and eosinophils, as\\nwell as differentiating B cells into IgE secreting cells ( Ekkens et al.,\\n2003 ). Finally, activated Th17 cells produce IL-17A (also referred to as\\nIL-17), IL-21, IL-1 β, IL-6 and TNF- α, and play important roles in the\\nclearance of certain microbes, particularly extracellular bacteria and\\nfungi, by mediating intense chemotaxis of neutrophils to sites of\\ninﬂammation ( Andoh et al., 2001; Jovanovic et al., 1998; Matsuzaki\\nand Umemura, 2007; Gutcher and Becher, 2007 ).\\nTight regulation of effector T cell responses is required for effective\\ncontrol of infections and avoidance of immunopathological diseases\\n(Costantino et al., 2008 ). In this scenario, aberrant Th1 and, mainly, Th17\\ncell responses play critical roles in triggering organ-speci ﬁca u t o i m m u -\\nnity ( Miossec, 2009 ), whereas Th2 cells are pivotal in allergy and asthma\\n(Makani et al., 2008 ). Many works have demonstrated that ﬁne\\nimmuneregulation is mainly performed by a pool of regulatory T cells\\n(as revised by Vignali et al., 2008 ).\\nA number of T cells with regulatory functions have been described\\nin literature. These include IL-10-secreting T-regulatory 1 (Tr1) cells\\n(Maynard et al., 2007 ), transforming growth factor (TGF)- β-secreting\\nTh3 cells ( Kitani et al., 2003 ) and, more recently, CD4+CD25high\\nFoxp3+Treg cells ( Shevach, 2009 ). These regulatory T cells suppress\\nimmune responses by several mechanisms, such as the production of\\nanti-in ﬂammatory cytokines, mainly IL-10 and TGF- β. These cyto-\\nkines are pivotal to control immune responses by inhibiting not only\\nthe development of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, but also their effector\\nfunctions ( Belkaid, 2007; Li and Flavell, 2008; McGeachy et al., 2005 ).\\nAnxiety has been clearly linked to a greater susceptibility to\\ninfectious diseases. In addition, it is also known to contribute to thepathogenesis of many in ﬂammatory/autoimmune diseases ( Gill et al.,\\n2009; Wessa and Rohleder, 2007; Lemieux et al., 2008; Wilson et al.,\\n1999; Boscarino and Chang, 1999; Cohen and Schwartz, 1999; Af ﬂeck\\net al., 1997 ). Therefore, taking into count the high heterogeneity of\\nT cells subsets, the aim of the present work was to explore the T cell\\nproﬁle following in vitro non-speci ﬁc activation in a group of patients\\nwith generalized anxiety disorder and to investigate the impact of\\nglucocorticoid on this pro ﬁle. This kind of study is very important for\\nthe understanding of the speci ﬁc mechanisms by which chronic stress\\ndamages immune functionality and how it favors the occurrence of\\ninfectious and autoimmune/in ﬂammatory diseases.\\n2. Materials and methods2.1. Participants\\nFor our study 20 individuals with generalized anxiety disorder\\n(8 male, 12 female; mean age=29.4 years, SD=12.7, range 17 –42) and\\n20 healthy subjects without any detectable psychiatric disorder matched\\nby age (mean age=29.7 years, SD=10.3, range 19 –40), gender, racial\\nbackground and annual income were recruited to participate this study.\\nWe used the Spielberger State (STAIS) and Trait (STAIT) Anxiety\\nInventory ( Kohn et al., 2008 ), Hamilton Depression Rating scale\\n(HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAMA) to measure mood\\nstates in all subjects ( Hamilton, 1959 ). Individuals with a present, past\\nand family history of mental disorders were assessed through of theSemi structured Interview for the DSMIII-R (SCID) ( Spitzer et al., 1992 ).\\nAccording to the HAMA, we included only the patients with moderate –\\nsevere symptoms of anxiety.\\nSubjects were excluded if they reported intake of any medication\\nwith immune-modulating effects, such as glucocorticoids, had acute or\\nchronic organic illnesses, or met criteria for additional mental disorders\\nother than anxiety or stress-related affective disorders. Anxietydisorders often co-exist with other mental disorders, particularly\\nclinical depression, which may occur in as many as 60% of people with\\nanxiety. In our study, 05/20 among anxiety patients met the DSM-IV\\ncriteria for current major depressive episode, however, they were not\\nexcluded because no signi ﬁcant difference was observed between them\\nand the other non-depressive anxious individuals concerning the results\\nfrom immune function analysis. Although 14/20 anxious patients\\nreported past intake of psychotropic medication (12 anxiolytics and 2\\nantidepressants), all participants were completely medication-free for\\nat least six months prior to blood sampling. Of note, none of the women\\nwere pregnant or lactating. Finally, the Survey of Immunological and\\nGeneral Health (SIGH) was used as a self-report measure of physical\\nhealth ( Kang et al., 1991 ). The SIGH also includes questions on age,\\nweight, and demographic background and has been successfully used in\\na wide variety of studies ( Kang et al., 1991; Lemieux and Coe, 1995;\\nStrauman et al., 1993, 2004 ). Body Mass Index (BMI), that might affect\\nimmune function, was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the\\nsquare of height in meters. For our study, all subjects had BMIs ranging\\nfrom 18 to 30.\\nAfter a complete description of the study to the participants, written\\ninformed consent was obtained for each individual. The study was\\napproved by the Ethical Committee for Research on Human Subjects of\\nthe Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO).\\n2.2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and stimulus\\nFor our study, 20 mL of peripheral blood was collected between 10\\nand 11 a.m. in heparin treated tubes (BD Vacutainer, Franklin Lakes, NY).\\nThe peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained by\\ncentrifugation on Ficoll –Hypaque density gradients. The viable PBMC,\\nevaluated by trypan blue exclusion, were adjusted to 1×106/mL and\\ncultured either in a 96-well ﬂat-bottomed microplates with 200 μLo f\\ncomplete RPMI 1640 medium or in a 24-well ﬂat-bottomed microplates\\nwith 1 mL of complete RPMI 1640 medium. The RPMI 1640 was\\nconsidered complete when it was added with 2 mM of L-glutamine\\n(GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 10% of FCS, 20 U/mL of penicillin, 20 μg/mL of\\nstreptomycin and 20 mM of HEPES buffer. In order to induce T cell\\npolyclonal activation, whole PBMC cultures were maintained for 3 days\\nwith phytohemaglutinin (PHA, 1 μg/mL), which corresponds to the\\nperiod of maximal T cell activation. To evaluate the effect of\\nglucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX) (Sigma Chemicals, St Loius,\\nMD), at a concentration of 10−6M, the highest dose detected in vivo in\\nstress situations ( Franchimont et al. ,2000; Agarwal and Marshall, 1998 ),\\nwas added to some wells at the beginning of cell cultures. Of note, this\\nhigh DEX concentration did not induce cell death (data not shown). All\\ncells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidi ﬁed 5% CO 2incubator.\\n2.3. MTT assay\\nThe 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide\\n(MTT) assay was performed as previously described ( Roehm et al.,\\n1991 ). Brie ﬂy, 3 days after beginning of the PBMC cultures, activated or\\nnot with PHA (1 μg/mL), 40 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT were added to each well\\nin a 96-well ﬂat-bottomed microtiter plates and additionally incubated\\nfor 2 h at 37 °C in a humidi ﬁed 5% CO 2incubator. The reaction was\\nrevealed after dissolution of the formozan crystals with acidi ﬁed\\nisopropanol (150 μL/well). The resulting purple solution was spectro-\\nphotometrically measured at 570 nm in microplate reader (Dynex\\ntechnologies, Chantilly, VA). A blank with propanol alone was measured213 M.M.M.

Impact of anxiety on proliferation of peripheral blood cell cultures in\\nresponse to T cell polyclonal activator in the presence or absence of\\nglucocorticoid\\nTheﬁrst immune event measure in our study was T cell proliferation\\ninduced by the polyclonal activator phytohemagglutinin (PHA) by using\\nMTT assay. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the extent of T cell proliferation in\\nresponse to PHA was statistically lower in cell cultures from anxious\\nindividuals as compared with control group. Interestingly, the level of\\nMTT reduction was signi ﬁcantly higher in non-stimulated cultures\\n(medium) from the anxious group than in control cultures.\\nAlthough the level of MTT reduction is classically used as an indirect\\nmarker of the number of viable (living) cells, we also directly quanti ﬁed\\nthe number of viable cells at the end of cultures (3 days) by trypan blue\\nexclusion. Taking into account that the number of PBMC at the\\nbeginning of the cultures was 1×106/mL, we did not observe any\\ndetectable cell proliferation in the non-activated cell cultures from the\\nanxious group at direct cell counting ( Fig. 1 B). Nevertheless, as observed\\nby MTT test, we observed a lower cell proliferation following PHA-\\nactivation in cell cultures from anxious individuals ( Fig. 1 A).\\nConcerning the impact of glucocorticoid (GC) on the level of cell\\nactivation, we observed that, although the DEX had reduced the level of\\nspontaneous cell activation in cultures derived from anxious group, it\\ndid not reduce signi ﬁcantly the level of T cell proliferation in response to\\nPHA. On the other hand, at the same dose, the GC successfully inhibited\\nin approximately 48% the level of T cell proliferation in activated cell\\nculture from the control group.3.2.

Therefore, we decided\\nto evaluate the cytokine pro ﬁle of the PHA-activated or none activated\\ncell cultures from the two experimental groups. Of note, no detectable\\nspontaneous release of any cytokine was observed (data not shown). As\\ndemonstrated in Fig. 2 , the production of the classical Th1 cytokines, IL-2\\nand IFN- γ, after T cell activation was signi ﬁcantly higher in control cell\\ncultures than cultures derived from anxious group. Concerning the\\ndetermination of the Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, our results\\ndemonstrated that their release was also signi ﬁcantly higher in cell\\nFig. 1.

Among the anti-\\ninﬂammatory cytokines, the IL-10, whose production among human\\nT cells is restricted to the Tr-1 phenotype, was also signi ﬁcantly lower in\\ncell cultures from the anxious group ( Fig. 4 A). TGF- β, a cytokine\\nproduced mainly by activated Th3 cells, was low and did not reach any\\nstatistical difference between two groups ( Fig. 4 B). Finally, we\\nperformed the measurement of the cytokines related to Th17\\nphenotype, particularly the IL-17 cytokine. As demonstrated in theFig. 5 , the production of TNF- αand, mainly, IL-17 were signi ﬁcantly\\nhigher in the anxious group. Although no signi ﬁcant difference was\\nobserved, we noted a clear tendency towards increased IL-1 βand IL-6\\ncytokine production from activated cells cultures derived from the\\nanxious group ( Fig. 5 ).\\n3.3. Impact of glucocorticoid on cytokine pro ﬁle in cell cultures in\\nresponse to T cell polyclonal activator\\nFinally, our next step was to evaluate the impact of stress-related\\ndoses of GC on the different sets of cytokines produced in control and\\nanxious groups. As shown in Fig. 6 , while GC was able to attenuate the\\nrelease of IFN- γ, IL-4, and IL-17 from PHA-activated cell cultures from\\ncontrol group, it did not signi ﬁcantly alter the production of these\\ncytokines by the anxious group. Concerning IL-10, GC tended to up-\\nregulate its production only in control cultures.\\n4. Discussion\\nAnxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), are\\nassociated with an enhanced susceptibility to various somatic\\ndiseases. In this study, we observed important immune dysregula-\\ntions in these individuals that can have implications for human health.\\nTheﬁrst immune event analyzed was the level of T cell proliferation\\nfollowing non-speci ﬁc stimulation with a T cell mitogen, by using the\\nMTT assay. Interestingly, we detected a signi ﬁcant MTT reaction in non-\\nactivated cell cultures from the anxious group. However, a direct cell\\ncount in these cultures demonstrated an absence of cell proliferation.\\nTherefore, although the extension of MTT reaction is traditionally\\nrelated to the number of viable cells ( Roehm et al., 1991 ), in anxious\\nindividuals, this measurement was overestimated by the high basal\\nactivated state of cells from these subjects. MTT values are due to\\nmitochondrial amount/activity, which would re ﬂect elevated mono-\\ncytes percentage, known to have more mitochondrial than lympho-\\ncytes. Nevertheless, in our cohort, no statistical difference was observedconcerning the proportion of T cells (CD3\\n+), B cells (CD19+), and\\nmonocytes (CD14+) in the initial PBMC isolates (data not shown). The\\nreason for this higher background activation status may be related to\\nendogenous release of higher levels of neurotransmitters documented\\namong anxious individuals, such as substance P ( Tuluc et al., 2009 ). On\\nthe other hand, cell cultures from GAD individuals responded less to\\nPHA. This lower T cell proliferative response in GAD individuals could be\\nrelated to activation-induced cell death following excessive stimulation.\\nAt the moment, we are dedicating our efforts to investigate this issue.\\nThe kind of acquired immune response is strongly determined by\\nthe cytokine network produced by activated T cells. The production of\\nboth Th1 and Th2 cytokines was signi ﬁcantly lower in activated cell\\ncultures from anxious individuals, as compared with control ones. The\\nFig. 3.

      "Page 5 raw text: \"Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN- γare pivotal in the immune response\\nagainst intracellular pathogens by supporting effector functions and\\nmaintenance of memory CD8+and B lymphocytes ( Gutcher and\\nBecher, 2007 ). Thus, Th1 phenotype de ﬁciency results not only in\\ngreater susceptibility to infectious diseases but also favors the\\ndevelopment of malignancies ( Takkouche et al., 2001; Aviles et al.,\\n2004; Cohen et al., 1999; Ben-Eliyahu, 2003 ). On the other hand, Th2\\ncytokines are involved in both protection against gastrointestinal\\nnematodes and allergic disorders ( Romagnani, 1997 ). In order to\\navoid recruiting individuals with high tendency to develop Th2\\npattern, we excluded from the study all subjects with chronic atopic\\ndisorders, like asthma and atopic dermatitis. Our results indicate that\\nchronic anxiety-related stress damages both Th1 and Th2 responses.\\nThere are some mechanisms by which Th1 and Th2 responses\\ncould be attenuated in anxious subjects. Firstly, concerning Th1\\ncells, some literature data demonstrated a high susceptibility of Th1\\nlymphocytes to activation-induced cell death through CD95 (Fas)/\\nCD95L engagement ( Akkoc et al., 2008 ). Additionally, during\\npersistent in ﬂammation, IFN- γand TNF- αinduce indoleamine 2,3\\ndioxygenase expression, a DC enzyme that degrades tryptophan\\namino acid in L-formylkynurenine, decreasing tryptophan availability\\nthat is pivotal to Th1 function ( O'Connor et al., 2009; Dai and Dai,\\n2008 ). Finally, in chronically stressed patients the HPA axis is often\\nhyperactivated, resulting primarily in the release of high levels of CRHand cortisol ( Holsboer, 2000; Arborelius et al., 1999 ). While CRH\\ninhibits Th1 ( Poliak et al., 1997 ), the cortisol reduces both Th1 and\\nTh2 responses ( Ashwell et al., 2000 ). In our anxious group, however,\\nwe do not believe in an involvement of cortisol in the reduction of Th1\\nand Th2 responses, because we observed a clear proin ﬂammatory\\nproﬁle in this group, particularly with the overproduction of Th17\\ncytokines, which would also be inhibited by cortisol. Our results\\ndemonstrate a higher IL-17 and TNF- αrelease in activated cell\\ncultures from anxious individuals. Although IL-6 and IL-1 βproduction\\nwere not signi ﬁcantly different between the two groups, these two\\ncytokines are mainly produced by Th17 cells following phagocyte or\\nT cell activation in the presence of pathogen-associated molecular\\npatterns (PAMPs), such as LPS from bacteria ( van de Veerdonk et al.,\\n2009 ). At the moment, we are evaluating the response of PBMC\\ncultures from anxious individuals to bacterial and fungal antigens. To\\nour knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report that documented an enhanced\\nTh17 phenotype in anxious individuals. Of note, we also assessed\\nthe kinetics of cytokine release 24 and 48 h after PHA addition, and\\nTh17-related cytokines were always dominant in the cell cultures\\nfrom GAD individuals (data not shown). The polarized development\\nof Th17, Th1 and Th2 cells depends on counterregulatory effects\\non each other. In our system, the damage of both Th1 and Th2,\\nphenotypes in GAD patients could be related to the inhibitory effects\\nof Th17 cytokines ( Toh et al., 2009; Newcomb et al., 2009 ).\\nChronic psychological stress, including anxiety disorders, has been\\nassociated with exacerbations of autoimmune disease ( Kimerling,2004; Fortune et al., 2005; Arican et al., 2005; Matusevicius et al.,\\n1999; Kurasawa et al., 2000 ), such as psoriasis, multiple sclerosis\\n(MS), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) ( Afﬂeck et al. 1997, Kimerling,\\n2004; Fortune et al., 2005; Arican et al., 2005; Matusevicius et al.,\\n1999; Kurasawa et al., 2000 ). In humans, there is a considerable body\\nof evidence suggesting that enhanced Th17 response is involved in the\\naetiopathogenesis of in ﬂammatory and autoimmune diseases. In RA,\\nfor example, IL-17 can activate and enhance all mechanisms of tissue\\ninjury by up-regulating and/or synergizing with local in ﬂammatory\\nmediators such as IL-6 ( Katz et al., 2001; Chabaud et al., 1998 ), IL-1 β\\nand TNF- α(LeGrand et al., 2001; Katz et al., 2001; Chabaud et al.,\\n1998 ), and pro-oxidants such as nitric oxide ( Lubberts et al., 2000 ), as\\nwell as by stimulating the produc tion of extracellular matrix\\nmetalloproteinases that causes tissue damage ( Jovanovic et al.,\\n2000, 2001; Wright et al., 2004 ). Furthermore, this Th phenotype\\nhas been also implicated in the genesis of delayed type hypersensi-\\ntivity responses (DTH), and work by Altemus et al. (2003)\\ndemonstrated that individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder\\n(PTSD) evidence stronger DTH responses.\\nIn agreement with our results, it is well established that anxiety is\\nrelated to increased circulating levels of C-reactive protein, IL-6 and\\nTNF-α, IL-1β\\nand IL-8 ( O'Donovan et al., 2010; von Känel et al., 2010;\\nGill et al., 2009; Wessa and Rohleder, 2007; Lemieux et al., 2008;\\nWilson et al., 1999; Boscarino and Chang, 1999; Cohen and Schwartz,1999; Af ﬂeck et al., 1997; von Känel et al., 2007; Muller and Schwarz,\\n2002; Sutherland et al., 2003; Gill et al., 2008 ). The excessive\\ninﬂammation in anxious individuals might be a consequence of an\\ninsufﬁcient regulation of the immune function. In PTSD, for example,\\nthe HPA axis is often dysregulated, resulting in altered cortisol levels\\nand activity ( De Kloet et al., 2006 ).\\nGlucocorticoid (GC) hormones, particularly cortisol, can suppress\\ninﬂammatory cytokine production by downregulating the activity of the\\ntranscription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF κB) (De Bosscher et al.,\\n2000 ). NFκB is a potent activator of proin ﬂammatory gene transcription,\\nsuch as for IL-1 β,T N F - α, IL-6, and IL-12 ( Pahl, 1999 ). It is believed that,\\nafter long periods of exposure to stress-related hormones, glucocorti-\\ncoid resistance arises, primarily through a reduction of both sensitivity\\nand expression of GC receptors. This GC resistance compromises the\\nphysiological regulation of in ﬂammatory responses by HPA axis, leading\\nto a high basal immune activation state ( De Kloet et al., 2007; Gotovac\\net al., 2003 ). Indeed, in our cohort, although we did not measure\\nthe endogenous cortisol release, we observed a clear GC resistance\\nfollowing T cell activation with PHA.\\nAn exhaustion-induced damage of the intrinsic regulatory mechan-\\nisms of the immune system might also enhance the immune dysregula-\\ntion in chronic stress. In this context, we demonstrated a lower IL-10\\nproduction following T cell activation in the anxious group. Multiple\\nstudies in vivo have shown that the release of IL-10 by Tr-1 cells\\nconstitutes an important mechanism of control of in ﬂammatory\\nresponses ( Belkaid, 2007; McGeachy et al., 2005 ). Although we did not\\nFig. 6. The impact of glucocorticoid on in vitro cytokines in anxious individuals.

(2009) demonstrated that PTSD patients have a\\nreduced proportion of these regulatory T cells. IL-2 is essential not\\nonly for Treg cell homeostasis in vivo (Burchill et al., 2007; Davidson\\net al., 2007 ), but also for their ef ﬁcient suppressor function ( Horwitz\\net al., 2008 ). Thus, in our study, the IL-2 de ﬁciency detected in vitro\\nin anxious individuals can compromise the regulatory function of theseTreg cells. Furthermore, it has been suggested that IL-6, IL-1 β,a n dT N F - α\\nproduced by APC as a result of Toll-like receptor engagement, not\\nonly blocks CD4\\n+CD25+Treg cell-suppressive activity ( Pasare and\\nMedzhitov, 2003, Sutmuller et al., 2006 ), but may convert them into\\nproin ﬂammatory cells. Indeed, it was recently reported that Treg cells\\ncan be converted to IL-17-expressing cells in an appropriate proin ﬂam-\\nmatory cytokine environment ( Yang et al., 2008; Osorio et al., 2008 ).\\nFurthermore, the presence of these proin ﬂammatory cytokines can, in\\nturn, potentiate both anxiety, by acting on Central Nervous System\\n(Dantzer, 2001; Goehler et al. 2007; Sternberg, 2006 ;Dantzer, 2001;\\nGoehler et al., 2007; Bonaccorso et al., 2001 ), and cortisol resistance, by\\nreducing both number and sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors ( Pace\\net al., 2007 ).\\nIn summary, our results indicate that the profoundly altered\\ncomposition of the peripheral T cell compartment might cause a state\\nof compromised immune responsiveness, which may explain why\\nanxious patients show an increased susceptibility to infections, and\\ninﬂammatory and autoimmune diseases.\\nConﬂict of interest\\nAll authors declare that there are no con ﬂicts of interest.\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis work was supported by the Fundação de Amparo à Pequisa\\nCarlos Chagas Filho.\\nReferences\\nAfﬂeck, G., Urrows, S., Tennen, H., Higgins, P., Pav, D., Aloisi, R., 1997.

To explore\\nthe mechanism by which probiotic-fermented milk improves lipid metabolism, the\\ntranscription of genes regulated by liver X receptors (LXRs), 50-AMP-activated protein\\nkinase, and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which play integral roles in lipid metabolism,\\nwas investigated in hyperlipidemic rats. Compared with rats fed a high-fat diet,\\nthe administration of probiotic-fermented milk signiﬁcantly lowered the levels of total\\ncholesterol (TC) and total triglycerides (TG) in rat serum and viscera ( P<0.05) and\\nsigniﬁcantly increased the level of total bile acid in the rat liver and small intestine\\n(P<0.05). The quantitative PCR results showed that the probiotics ameliorated\\nthe TC levels in the rats by activating the transcription of genes involved in the\\nLXR axis, which promoted TC reverse transport and increased the conversion of\\nTC to bile acids. The level of TG in the hyperlipidemic rats was ameliorated by the\\ninhibition of the transcription of carbohydrate reaction element binding protein genes\\nand activation of the transcription of PPAR agenes. The regulation of lipid metabolism-\\nrelated gene transcription by the single probiotic ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus LV108)-\\nfermented milk was more effective than that by the combined probiotic ( L. rhamnosus\\nLV108, Lactobacillus casei grx12, and Lactobacillus fermentum grx08)-fermented\\nmilk ( P<0.05).\\nKeywords: lipid metabolism, hyperlipidemic rats, probiotics, fermented milk, LXRs, AMPK, FXR\\nINTRODUCTION\\nHyperlipidemia is a common cardiovascular disease posing a serious threat to human health.

L. rhamnosus Improves Lipid Metabolism\\nmicroorganisms on serum lipid levels, and probiotic beneﬁts\\nhave been emphasized over the last 40 years. Accumulating\\nstudies have shown that well-established probiotics, prebiotics,\\nand synbiotics possess hypocholesterolemic and other eﬀects that\\nmodulate serum lipids in humans and animals (He and Shi,\\n2017). Currently, the mechanisms by which probiotics and their\\nfermentation products reduce lipid levels mainly include the\\nadhesion and absorption of living bacteria cells, the production\\nof short chain fatty acids, the reduction of the reabsorption of bile\\nacids, and the inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity.\\nRecently, several studies have shown that liver X receptors\\n(LXRs), 50-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the farnesoid\\nX receptor (FXR) and their downstream target genes play\\nimportant roles in lipid metabolism (Tu et al., 2000; Geyeregger\\net al., 2006; Y ao et al., 2016). LXRs, which are nuclear receptors\\nactivated by oxidized sterols, are widely expressed in the liver\\nand small intestine and regulate some key genes in cholesterol\\nmetabolism (Zelcer and Tontonoz, 2006). The main function of\\nLXRs includes limiting cholesterol accumulation in macrophages\\nand other peripheral cell types by increasing the expression of the\\nreverse cholesterol transporters ATP-binding cassette members\\nA1 (ABCA1), G1 (ABCG1), and G5 (ABCG5), resulting in a\\nprogram of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) (Song et al., 1994;\\nWilly et al., 1995; Tall et al., 2008). AMPK is a serine/threonine\\nkinase widely found in eukaryotic cells that play an important role\\nin maintaining the balance of cellular energy metabolism (Y ao\\net al., 2016). Once activated, AMPK stimulates the activator of\\nthe oxide enzyme to activate receptor a(PPAR a), upregulating\\nthe related target genes, promoting fatty acid oxidation to\\nenhance the body’s catabolism, enhancing the b-oxidation of\\nfatty acids, and promoting the production of ATP (Patel et al.,\\n2014). AMPK can also inhibit the expression and transcriptional\\nactivity of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1c)\\nand carbohydrate reaction element binding protein (ChREBP),\\ndownregulating the transcription of related target genes and\\ninhibiting lipid synthesis (Tu et al., 2000; Yoshikawa et al., 2001).\\nBile acids are endogenous FXR ligands expressed in the small\\nintestine (Tu et al., 2000). FXRs can maintain the internal stability\\nof bile acids by regulating the transcription of genes involved in\\nbile acid metabolism (Tu et al., 2000). In addition, FXRs regulate\\nthe synthesis and transport of bile acids and prevent the excessive\\naccumulation of bile acids in hepatocytes by inhibiting CYP7A1\\ntranscription (Tu et al., 2000).\\nRecently, some studies have shown that probiotics can inhibit\\ncholesterol uptake and increase cholesterol eﬄux by activating\\nLXRs, eventually reducing the overall cholesterol level and\\npotential risk of developing atherosclerosis (Huang et al., 2015).\\nTo the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on the\\neﬀects of probiotics on the multiple pathways of lipid metabolism\\nor compared the eﬀects of probiotics and combined probiotics\\non gene transcription in the lipid metabolism pathway. In this\\nstudy, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LV108, Lactobacillus casei grx12,\\nand Lactobacillus fermentum grx08 were isolated from human\\nbodies at the Long Life Village in China (Chen, 2014). These three\\nstrains possess good acid resistance, artiﬁcial gastrointestinal\\ntolerance, and bile salt tolerance in vitro . These three strains\\nhave been shown to improve the intestinal ﬂora, antagonizepathogenic bacteria, modulate the immune response, possess\\nanti-oxidation activity, and prevent tumors in animal models.\\nRegarding blood lipid regulation, our previous study showed\\nthat L. rhamnosus LV108, L. casei grx12, and L. fermentum\\ngrx08 can reduce cholesterol in vivo and in vitro (Chen, 2014;\\nHuang et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2016).\\nIn this study, hyperlipidemic rats were used as a model to\\ninvestigate the eﬀects of fermented milk containing L. rhamnosus\\nLV108, L. casei grx12, and L. fermentum grx08 on the\\ntranscription levels of lipid metabolism genes. Simultaneously,\\nthe eﬀects of single probiotic-fermented milk and a mixture of\\nmilks fermented with three probiotics on hyperlipidemic rats\\nwere analyzed and compared.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nProbiotics and Preparation of Milk\\nFermented With Probiotics\\nThe starter cultures ( L. rhamnosus LV108, L. casei grx12, and\\nL. fermentum grx08) were provided by Jiangsu Province Key\\nLaboratory of Dairy Processing and Safety, Y angzhou University.\\nEach activated culture was inoculated into de Man, Rogosa, and\\nSharpe (MRS) medium (Haibo Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Qingdao,\\nChina) and incubated at 37\\x0eC for 12 h.\\nSkim milk (12%, w/w) was heat-treated at 95\\x0eC for 15 min\\nand cooled to 37\\x0eC. The milk was fermented with L. rhamnosus\\nLV108, L. casei grx12, or L. fermentum grx08 at 37\\x0eC for 20 h\\nand stored at 4\\x0eC. The L. rhamnosus LV108-fermented milk\\nwas fermented with L. rhamnosus LV108, and the combined\\nprobiotic-fermented milk was a mixture of the three milks\\nfermented with a single probiotic strain at a 1:1:1 ( w:w:w) ratio.\\nThe number of viable bacteria in each milk fermented with a\\nsingle probiotic strain and the combined probiotic-fermented\\nmilk was quantiﬁed to ensure that the number of viable bacteria\\nwas above 1\\x021010cfu\\x01mL\\x001.

Furthermore, the ABCG5, Hmgr, and HMG-CoA gene\\ntranscription in the HFPB group were signiﬁcantly higher than\\nthat in the HF group ( P<0.05, Figure 2 ).\\nHowever, in the HFPB group, the transcription of genes\\ninvolved in the regulation of cholesterol transport and\\nmetabolism (LXR a, LXR b, ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG5, Hmgr,\\nand HMG-CoA) was signiﬁcantly increased compared to that\\nin the HFPBS group ( P<0.05, Figure 2 ). Furthermore, the\\nSREBP-1C and PPAR agene transcription levels in the HFPB\\ngroup were signiﬁcantly higher than that in the HFPBS group\\n(P<0.05, Figure 2 ).\\nTranscription Levels of Genes\\nAssociated With Lipid Metabolism in the\\nSmall Intestine of Rats\\nThe transcription levels of the genes associated with lipid\\nmetabolism in the small intestine of rats are illustrated in\\nFigure 3 . Compared to the C group, feeding the rats a high-fat\\ndiet signiﬁcantly increased the transcription of genes involved in\\ncholesterol transport and metabolism (LXR a, LXR b, ABCA1, and\\nABCA5) ( P<0.05, Figure 3 ).In the HFPB group, the transcription of genes involved in the\\nregulation of adipogenesis (SCD1 and PPAR a) and cholesterol\\ntransport, and the metabolism (LXR a, LXR b, ABCA1, and\\nABCA5) was signiﬁcantly increased compared with that in the\\nHF group ( P<0.05, Figure 3 ).\\nIn the HFPBS group, the transcription of genes involved in\\ncholesterol transport and metabolism (ABCA1) was signiﬁcantly\\nincreased, and the transcription of LXR b, ABCA5, FXR, and\\nCYP7A1 was decreased compared with that in the HF group\\n(P<0.05, Figure 3 ). Furthermore, transcription in the HFPBS\\ngroup was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the HFPB group\\n(P<0.05, Figure 3 ).\\nDISCUSSION\\nBased on previous studies, this study attempts to analyze the\\nmultifaceted mechanism by which probiotics reduce lipid levels\\nin their hosts by evaluating the transcription of the genes involved\\nin the LXR, AMPK, and FXR axes of lipid metabolism. In\\naddition, the eﬀects of single and combined probiotic-fermented\\ndairy products on the lipid level and transcription of lipid\\nmetabolism-related genes in hyperlipidemic rats were compared.\\nThe results show that probiotic-fermented dairy products\\nsigniﬁcantly reduced the levels of TC and TG in the serum, liver,\\nand small intestine of the rats and reduced lipid accumulation\\nin the liver. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the\\nsingle and combined probiotic-fermented dairy products. Other\\nreports have shown that L. acidophilus ,L. plantarum 9-41-A,\\nL. fermentum M1-16, and L. plantarum MA2 are able to reduce\\nthe liver TC and lipid levels (Fukushima and Nakano, 1996; Wang\\net al., 2009; Xie et al., 2011), while another study also showed that\\nthe probiotic L. gasseri SBT2055 can reduce not only abdominal\\nvisceral fat but also subcutaneous fat (Kadooka et al., 2010).\\nCompared to the HF group, the transcription of genes\\ninvolved in the LXR axis in the liver and small intestine\\nwas signiﬁcantly upregulated in both the HFPB and HFPBS\\ngroups. LXRs are the main “receptors” maintaining the relative\\nstability of intracellular cholesterol. The LXRs predominantly\\nmaintain cholesterol balance through the following processes:\\n(1) inhibition of the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in food;\\n(2) regulation of the synthesis and absorption of cholesterol in\\nthe liver; (3) regulation of the reverse transport of cholesterol;\\nand (4) promotion of the transformation of cholesterol to bile\\nacid and cholesterol excretion through bile (Trasino et al.,\\n2013).

(D)Cells from the HFPBS group containing many large fat vacuoles.\\nHFPBS group was signiﬁcantly higher than that in the HF\\ngroup ( P<0.05). The transcription of the LXR genes in the\\nliver and small intestine of the rats was considered activated\\nby the probiotics, thus upregulating the transcription of genes\\ninvolved in the LXR axis. The upregulated transcription of\\nABCA1 and ABCG1 increased cellular cholesterol eﬄux to HDL-\\nC in the serum, which increased RCT. The upregulation of\\nABCG5 promotes the secretion and excretion of cholesterol\\nin the hepatobiliary tube. Furthermore, upon activation, the\\nLXR in the small intestine has been observed to be activated,\\nand the transcription of NPC1 L1 was downregulated (Wang\\net al., 2006), which reduced the absorption of cholesterol,\\nincreased the transcription of ABCG5, and mediated the ﬂow\\nof sterols in intestinal cells to the absorption of cholesterol\\nin the intestinal cavity (Wang et al., 2006). Therefore, the\\ncontent of TC in the serum and liver in the HFPB and HFPBS\\ngroups ( Table 4 ) was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the HF\\ngroup ( P<0.05), while the content of TBA was signiﬁcantly\\nincreased ( P<0.05). In addition, in the intestinal tract, the\\nupregulation of the FXR and CYP7A1 genes as a result of\\nthe administration of the probiotics-fermented milks was not\\nsigniﬁcantly compared with that in the HF group, and that in\\nthe HFPBS group was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the HF\\ngroup. Thus, it is possible that a decrease in the host TC caused\\nby probiotics may not be achieved by aﬀecting the genes involved\\nin the FXR axis.\\nRegarding the transcription of triglyceride-related genes in the\\nliver and small intestine, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerencesin AMPK transcription between the HFPB and HFPBS groups\\ncompared with the HF group, but the transcription of LXR a,\\nPPAR a, and SCD-1 in the liver was signiﬁcantly upregulated,\\nwhile the transcription of ChREBP and FAS was signiﬁcantly\\ndownregulated ( P<0.05). First, ChREBP is a target gene of\\nLXRs and can upregulate the transcription of liver-type pyruvate\\nkinase. ChREBP and liver-type pyruvate kinase play important\\nroles in the conversion of carbohydrates to lipids. A study by\\nUyeda et al. (2002) showed that LXR agonists can promote\\nthe conversion of carbohydrates to fat in the liver, leading to\\nthe accumulation of fat in this organ. However, in the current\\nstudy, the probiotics activated the transcription of the LXR\\ngene but reduced the transcription of the ChREBP gene, which\\ninhibited the transformation of carbohydrates into fat in the liver\\nand reduced hepatic fat accumulation. Similarly, the treatment\\nwith the probiotics resulted in an upregulation of the SCD-1\\ngene in the liver. SCD-1 reduces free saturated fatty acids in\\nliver cells, thus reducing the induction of lipid peroxidation in\\nliver cells. Second, the treatment with the probiotics resulted\\nin the upregulation of the LXR aand PPAR agenes in the\\nliver, and a study by Trasino et al. (2013) showed that LXR a\\ncan inhibit the diﬀerentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into\\nadipocytes through Wnt/ b-catenin ( b-catenin) signaling. PPAR a\\nregulates peroxidase, fatty acid transport, and mitochondrial\\nfatty acid b-oxidation metabolism gene transcription and\\nexpression, thereby promoting the decomposition, absorption,\\nand utilization of fatty acids (Zhou et al., 2008). Therefore, the\\ntreatment with the probiotics did not directly activate AMPK,\\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1312'\n",

First, the daily diet was\\nan important factor aﬀecting lipid metabolism. When a large\\namount of fat is provided in the diet, the transcription levels\\nof the genes maintaining homeostasis in lipid metabolism (e.g.,\\nLXRs, AMPK, and FXR) were also upregulated to maintain\\nthe lipid levels. The HF, HFPB, and HFPBS groups were\\nfed a high-fat diet; thus, these groups showed similar trends.\\nHowever, after the probiotics administration intervention, the\\nlipid metabolism disorder induced by the high-fat diet was\\nalleviated, further indicating that the administration of the\\nprobiotics was eﬀective. Second, the degree of hepatocytes\\nsteatosis that the histopathological examination showed was not\\nsuﬃcient to stop lipid metabolism, so rats could still undergo\\nfeedback regulation when they ingested a large quantity of lipids.\\nIn addition, compared with the HF group, hepatocytes steatosis\\nwas obviously alleviated in the HFPB and HFPBS group, further\\nsuggesting that the damage was reversible and that the probiotics\\nadministration intervention was eﬀective.\\nFurthermore, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the\\nphysiological and biochemical indexes between the HFPB and\\nHFPBS groups, except TC level, and the ability of the rats in\\nthe HFPB group to regulate the transcription of cholesterol\\nmetabolism-related genes was signiﬁcantly better than that in\\nthose in the HFPBS group ( P>0.05). Notably, LXR agonists\\ncan cause the accumulation of liver fat and an increase in\\nTG levels in the plasma, which mainly occurs because LXRs\\ninduce the transcription of SREBP1c. SREBP1c is a major\\ntranscription factor of the fat synthesis gene, which activates\\na variety of enzymes involved in fatty acid and triglyceridesynthesis. Therefore, researchers believe that new LXR agonists\\ncan regulate some repressor and auxiliary activators to selectively\\nupregulate ABCA1 without upregulating the transcription of\\nSREBP1c (Beyea et al., 2007). The transcription of SREBP1c was\\nsigniﬁcantly downregulated in the HFPB group but signiﬁcantly\\nupregulated in the HFPBS group. Therefore, we believe that the\\nlong-term use of L. rhamnosus LV108-fermented dairy products\\nhas a better eﬀect on reducing lipid accumulation in the liver,\\nsmall intestine, and blood.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe milk fermented with a single probiotic ( L. rhamnosus LV108)\\nand the combined probiotic ( L. rhamnosus LV108, L. casei grx12,\\nandL. fermentum grx08)-fermented milk signiﬁcantly improved\\nthe lipid levels and visceral lipid accumulation in hyperlipidemic\\nrats. At the physiological and biochemical levels, there were\\nno signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the single probiotic- and\\ncombined probiotic-fermented milks in the hyperlipidemic rats;\\nhowever, the regulation of the transcription of lipid metabolism-\\nrelated genes caused by the single probiotic-fermented milk\\nwas more eﬀective than that by the combined probiotic-\\nfermented milk.\\nETHICS STATEMENT\\nThis study was carried out in accordance with the\\nrecommendations of the China Institutional and National\\nGuidelines, Ethics Committee of the Y angzhou University.\\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 June 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1312'\n",

      "Page 2 raw text: 'the aged dog as a model of human cognitive aging and\\ndementia.\\nAnimal models that exhibit isomorphisms with human\\ncognitive aging and dementia are valuable for two reasons:(1) to generate and test hypotheses to further our under-standing of aging processes, and (2) to identify therapeuticsfor clinical screening. The pharmacological validity of ananimal model depends on its ability to accurately predict\\nsuccessful therapeutics in humans. The present review seeks\\nto extend the utility of the dog model by establishing itspharmacological validity, namely its accuracy in predictingthe efficacy of potential cognitive-enhancing therapeutics(CETs) in humans.\\n2. Establishing pharmacological validity: importance of\\nnegative data\\nMost discussions of pharmacological validity focus on\\npositive effects in animal models that predict positive effectsin humans. By contrast, negative findings are generallyignored, likely because negative data is rarely published.However, the ability to predict that a compound will beineffective has important pharmacoeconomic benefits. The\\nestimated cost of bringing one CET to market is now 525\\nmillion dollars ( Tufts Center for the Study of Drug\\nDevelopment, 2004 ). The most costly part of this total is\\nincurred when carrying out ineffective clinical trials, whichcan be reduced in frequency with a model that accuratelypredicts negative results. This should result in decreasedcost burdens to the end consumer—the patient.\\nIn addition to the pharmacoeconomic benefits, utilization\\nof multiple animal models is also potentially important for\\nsafety reasons. This was clearly illustrated in the AN-1792clinical trials, which were initiated in human subjects as aresult of positive evidence from the transgenic mousemodel. The trials were suspended after 18 patientsdeveloped meningoencephalitis, some of which died. Thepreclinical screens did not predict this adverse event, likelybecause the A hvaccine targeted a foreign peptide in the\\ntransgenic mouse whereas it targeted an endogenous peptide\\nin the human, causing an autoimmune response ( Robinson\\net al., 2004 ). Perhaps this outcome could have been avoided\\nif preclinical data also were obtained from primates orcanines, which naturally deposit A h.\\nCurrently, only four drugs are marketed for Alzheimer’s\\ndisease (AD): three acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitorsand one N-methyl- d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist.\\nNone of the currently approved treatments significantly\\nattenuate the progress of the disease; at best, they onlyattenuate the cognitive symptoms and even this may belimited ( Courtney et al., 2004 ). Therefore the ability to detect\\ntrue positives in animal models is limited by both the smallnumber of approved drugs and by the absence of approveddrugs that prevent or reverse the progression of the disease inclinical trials. Furthermore, the benefits of all four approveddrugs are limited in duration of effect and are beneficial only\\nin restricted subsets of the AD population. In many cases,positive effects depend on reducing the rate of cognitivedecline, rather than reversing or halting the disease. Thus, theassessment of pharmacological validity should consider theaccuracy of both positive and negative findings.\\nWe have conducted numerous studies to evaluate the\\nefficacy of purported cognitive enhancers on aged dogs.\\nThese have included, but were not limited to, AChE\\ninhibitors, ampakine, selegiline ( l-deprenyl), and adrafinil.\\nThis review first provides an overview of the evidencesupporting the use of the dog as a model of human agingand dementia. The remainder of the review summarizespharmacological work and, where applicable, briefly com-pares our efficacy studies in dogs with those conducted inhumans, rodents and, where applicable, primates.\\n3. Dog model of aging and dementia—a brief overview\\nCognitive functions include a set of higher-level mental\\nprocesses that enable us to learn, remember, plan, and adaptour behavior to environmental changes. In aged dogs,cognitive decline is manifested in the development of\\nimpaired learning, depressed memory and reduced behav-\\nioral flexibility. Not all processes are equally affected;simple rule-based learning, simple discrimination learningand procedural learning remain largely intact ( Milgram et\\nal., 1994 ). By contrast, deficits in executive function and\\nvisuospatial function occur at high incidence in agedanimals ( Adams et al., 2000b ) and can be detected in dogs\\nas young as 6 years of age (unpublished data). Complex rule\\nlearning, such as non-matching working memory paradigms\\n(Callahan et al., 2000; Chan et al., 2002; Head et al., 1995 )\\nand landmark discrimination ( Milgram et al., 1999, 2002a ),\\nalso is impaired in aged dogs. This pattern of cognitivedecline shows many parallels to that seen in human agingand AD. Two of the earliest signs of cognitive decline in ADpatients are impaired visuospatial function ( Flicker et al.,\\n1984, 1991; Freedman and Oscar-Berman, 1989 )a n d\\ndelayed recall, which is dependent on executive function\\n(Morris and Baddeley, 1988 ).\\nCanine aging is also similar to human aging in that both\\nshow extensive individual differences. Aged dogs can becharacterized as successful agers, mildly impaired orseverely impaired based on their cognitive test performance(Adams et al., 2000b ). These categories are analogous to\\nhuman successful aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\\nand dementia, respectively ( Adams et al., 2000a ). For a\\ncomplete review of the cognitive aspects of the dog modelof human aging and dementia, see Adams et al. (2000a) .\\nThe neuropathological changes that develop in dogs are\\nsimilar to those seen in human aging and AD. Dogs are oneof the few laboratory animals that naturally develop A h,a\\nkey feature of AD, also seen to a lesser extent in normalaging. Dogs predominantly accumulate the more neurotoxicC.M.

The level of A hcorrelates\\nwith the degree of cognitive impairment ( Cummings et al.,\\n1996a; Head et al., 1998 ). The dog A hsequence is identical\\nto the human sequence ( Johnstone et al., 1991; Selkoe et al.,\\n1987 ) and is vulnerable to similar post-translational mod-\\nifications ( Azizeh et al., 2000; Fonseca et al., 1999; Satou et\\nal., 1997 ). Aged dogs, like humans, also demonstrate\\noxidative damage, caspase activation, neuritic dystrophy,astrogliosis, cortical atrophy and decreased brain volume(Head, 2001; Cummings et al., 1996b ). Collectively, the\\ncognitive and neuropathological findings support the use ofthe aged dog as a model for human aging and dementia, as\\nwell as a model for predicting the efficacy of putative CETs.\\n4. Cholinergic drugs and canine cognitive decline\\nThe cholinergic hypothesis of aging and AD provides the\\ntheoretical rationale for treating AD with drugs that enhancecholinergic transmission. According to the cholinergic\\nhypothesis, cognitive impairment in both mild AD and\\nnormal aging is caused by loss or dysfunction of acetylcho-line-producing neurons ( Bartus et al., 1982 ). This hypoth-\\nesis led to the development of three of the four currentlyapproved therapeutics for AD.\\nDirect evidence of AChE inhibitors’ cognitive-enhancing\\neffects is provided by studies showing: (1) improvedcognitive function or delayed cognitive decline in demented\\npopulations, and (2) reversal of scopolamine-induced\\ncognitive deficits. Scopolamine is a non-specific muscarinicantagonist that, at low doses, causes a pattern of cognitivedeficits that parallel those seen in aging ( Araujo et al., 2004;\\nBartus, 2000; Bartus et al., 1982; Drachman and Leavitt,1974 ). We have used both of these strategies to assess the\\nefficacy of AChE inhibitors in the dog model using twoAChE inhibitors: (1) CP-118,954, a second generation\\nAChE inhibitor that was dropped after phase II human\\nclinical trials, and (2) phenserine, a third generation AChEinhibitor that is currently in phase III human clinical trials.\\nWe first tested aged dogs on a variable delay two-\\ncomponent delayed non-matching to position task (2c-DNMP). In this task, a sample block is presented in one oftwo spatial positions (left, right). After a brief delay, twoidentical blocks are presented. To obtain the food reward,\\nthe animal must remember the position of the sample\\nblock and displace the block in the novel spatial position.To vary memory load, we used a variable delay version ofthe task, in which delays of 20 s, 70 s and 110 s were usedwithin a single test session. After a 10-day placebo run-inensured stable performance on the 2c-DNMP, the animalsreceived one of three doses of CP-118,954 (0.02, 0.06 or0.12 mg/kg, p.o.).As illustrated in Fig. 1 , dogs performed better under CP-\\n118,954 [ F(2,12)=66.01, pb0.001], than under the placebo\\nrun-in, independently of dose. These improvements wereespecially prevalent towards the end of the treatment phase.During the first five sessions, the animals’ performance onthe medium and high doses was slightly impaired, likely dueto side effects. Fig. 2 illustrates that CP-118,954 seemed to\\nbe having a greater effect at the longest delay. The design of\\nthis study, however, was problematic because of the absence\\nof a control group. We subsequently used a counterbalancedwithin-subject control protocol and found a much smallernon-significant effect. In humans, CP-118,954 developmentwas discontinued after reaching phase II clinical trials(Lundbeck Institute, 2003 ).\\nWe recently have obtained more robust evidence of\\ncholinergic involvement in canine cognition with the use of\\nphenserine, a third generation AChE inhibitor. We first\\nlooked at phenserine’s ability to both improve workingmemory and reverse scopolamine-induced working memorydeficits in geriatric dogs. All subjects previously had beentrained on a spatial memory task, the three-componentdelayed non-match to position task (3c-DNMP), which is amodification of the 2c-DNMP task described above butworking memory demand is increased by the inclusion of\\nthree spatial locations (left, center, right) as opposed to two.\\nThe dogs were divided into two cognitively equivalent\\ngroups, based on previous performance, and received eitherplacebo or 0.5 mg/kg phenserine (p.o.). After a 5-day wash-in on their respective treatments, the dogs were retrained onthe 3c-DNMP at a delay of 5 s. Errors to relearn andcomplete a predetermined two-stage criterion tended to belower in the phenserine treated group than the placebo\\ngroup.\\nAfter the animals acquired the task at a 5-s delay, they\\nwere tested on a variable delay 3c-DNMP using 20- and80-s delays.

The\\noddity discrimination is a complex discrimination because\\nthe dog must learn that the odd object of three always coversthe food reward. With each increasing level of oddity, theobjects become more similar and therefore the task is moredifficult ( Milgram et al., 2002b ). Each animal received 0.5\\nmg/kg of phenserine (p.o.) on either level 1 or 2 of oddityand a placebo capsule (p.o.) on the other level.\\nPhenserine significantly improved acquisition of the\\nmore difficult oddity discrimination but not on the easier\\noddity discrimination ( Fig. 6 ). The absence of effect on the\\neasier oddity level is not surprising; we previouslydemonstrated that easier discriminations decreased theability to detect cognitive-enhancing effects of a therapeutic(Milgram et al., 2002b ). If the task is too easy, dogs reach\\nceiling levels of performance that cannot be improvedfurther. This likely occurred on the first level of oddity\\ndiscrimination used in this study.\\nThus far, human phenserine data parallel the canine data:\\nphase II clinical trials suggest that phenserine is effective inimproving memory in mild-to-moderate AD. In aged rodentmodels, phenserine reverses scopolamine-induced passiveavoidance deficits, maze learning deficits induced by N-\\nmethyl- d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism ( Patel et al., 1998 )\\nand improves acquisition of the Stone maze ( Ikari et al.,\\n1995 ).\\nOf the two strategies used in animals to demonstrate the\\ncognitive-enhancing effects of AChE inhibitors, reversal ofscopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction is only oflimited utility and its sensitivity to cholinergic facilitationis not surprising. It is unlikely, however, that scopolaminecan be used as a model for assessing the efficacy of potentialcognitive enhancers that do not directly, or indirectly, act on\\ncentral cholinergic neurotransmission. We have found that\\nadrafinil is unable to reverse scopolamine-induced deficitsin the dog (unpublished data). This raises the issue of the\\nscopolamine paradigm’s predictive validity for assessingnovel AD therapeutics not targeting the cholinergic system.\\nThe aged non-human primate ( Bartus, 1979; Bartus and\\nDean, 1988 ), rodent ( Ikari et al., 1995 ) and the dog model\\naccurately predict the effectiveness of cholinergic enhancingtherapies, suggesting a potential usefulness for screeningother classes of drugs. Since all of these models predict the\\neffectiveness of cholinergic enhancement, it is difficult to\\ndetermine which model demonstrates greater levels ofpredictive validity; therefore, it is necessary to comparethese models based on their ability to predict ineffectivecompounds.\\n5. Ampakines\\nDrugs that alter the glutaminergic system have been\\nstudied in aging and dementia because of evidenceindicating both that the glutaminergic system is compro-mised in aging ( Yamada and Nabeshima, 1998 ) and also that\\nglutaminergic neurotransmission is critical for normallearning ( Riedel et al., 2003 ). Ampakines are a class of\\ncompounds that allosterically modulate the AMPA receptor,\\nwhich purportedly enhances long-term potentiation, a\\ncellular model of learning and memory, especially in thehippocampus and cortical networks. Several studies withrodents suggested robust effects of ampakines on normallearning and memory. Hampson et al. (1998a,b) showed that\\ntreatment with ampakines significantly improved delayedrecall on a DNMP task and this improvement correlatedwith a 100–350% increase in hippocampal cell signaling.\\nPreliminary evidence in small human trials seemed to\\nsupport these findings ( Johnson and Simmon, 1999 ). We\\nused a visuospatial working memory task (2c-DNMP) toassess the purported cognitive enhancing effects of one ofthe ampakines (CP-531,708).\\nOddity LevelODD1 ODD2Errors-to-Criterion\\n050100150200250300350Phenserine \\nPlacebo \\nFig. 6.

Each groupreceived a 10-day placebo run-in to ensure stable perform-ance and then received one of three doses of CP-531,708 (5mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 45 mg/kg, p.o.) for 20 days. The resultsdid not reveal positive effects; to the contrary, during the\\nfirst 10 days of ampakine treatment, performance accuracy\\non the task decreased compared to the placebo run-in,[F(2,12)=2.8965, p=0.0941]. As illustrated in Fig. 7 ,\\nperformance subsequently returned to baseline levels. Wealso found a significant impairment at the longest delay,suggesting that this ampakine may have memory impairingeffects [ F(4,24)=4.0899, p=0.0115] ( Fig. 8 ).\\nThese findings in the dog model contrast with those\\nobtained in rodents, which did not accurately predict the\\noutcome of clinical trials. CX-516 recently failed Phase IIbMCI clinical trials and is no longer in development for agingand dementia ( Osborne, 2004 ).\\n6. Selegiline ( l-deprenyl)\\nSelegiline ( l-deprenyl) is an irreversible monoamine\\noxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that has neuroprotectivefeatures and is used for treating Parkinson’s disease.Selegiline is also a potential therapeutic for AD. Initialhuman clinical trials reported modest beneficial effects(Adelman, 1997; Alafuzoff et al., 2000 ). In rodents, most\\n(Brandeis et al., 1991; Drago et al., 1986; Gelowitz et al.,\\n1994; Knoll, 1989; Nowakowska et al., 2001 ) but not all\\nstudies ( Barber et al., 1993; Yavich et al., 1993 ) have shown\\ncognitive improvements.\\nWe have conducted both pharmacokinetic and efficacy\\nstudies to characterize selegiline’s cognitive-enhancingeffects in the aged dog. Initially, we identified an optimaldose of selegiline by conducting dose–response studies. Anacute administration study suggested that adverse effects\\noccurred at doses of 2 mg/kg (p.o.) or greater ( Head and\\nMilgram, 1992 ). These adverse effects, most notably\\nstereotypy, were attributed to either increased phenylethyl-amine, due to MAO-B inhibition, and/or increased amphet-amine, a metabolite of selegiline ( Head and Milgram, 1992 ).\\nA chronic administration study supported the use of doses aslarge as 1 mg/kg (p.o.); none of the dogs exhibited\\nstereotypy after 7 days of treatment ( Milgram et al.,\\n1995 ). Chronic treatment of selegiline resulted in a dose-\\ndependent inhibition of MAO-B in the brain, liver andkidney ( Milgram et al., 1995 ). Monoamin oxidase A (MAO-\\nA), by contrast, was unaffected ( Milgram et al., 1995 ).\\nEfficacy was determined using the variable delay 2c-\\nDNMP paradigm described above. After a 5-day placeborun-in ensured stable performance on the task, eight dogs\\n(three young and five old) randomly received 1-week\\ntreatments of placebo, low-dose (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) or high-dose selegiline (1.0 mg/kg, p.o.). Overall, the effect ofselegiline depended on age and individual response to thetreatment ( Head et al., 1996 ). The performance of young\\ndogs did not improve with selegiline treatment. Aged dogsresponded differentially to each dose of selegiline; someimproved on the low dose whereas others improved on the\\nhigh dose and others still were unresponsive. Therefore, the\\noverall drug effect was not significant (see Fig. 2 in Head et\\nal., 1996 ) but a best-dose analysis, which uses the dose at\\nwhich the animal performs most accurately as the treatmentmeasure, revealed that selegiline improved visuospatialworking memory (see Fig. 3 in Head et al., 1996 ). To\\ndetermine whether the best-case analysis revealed a legit-imate cognitive-enhancing effect being masked due to a\\nsmall sample size, we conducted a second experiment\\nexamining the effects of selegiline on working memoryperformance (variable delay 2c-DNMP). In this experiment,there was no overall effect of 0.75 mg/kg (p.o.) of selegiline(Fig. 9 ). However, once again, a subset of animals seemed\\nto benefit from the treatment.\\nDelay (Seconds)20 70 110Accuracy (% Correct)\\n74767880828486889092Baseline \\nLow Dose \\nMedium Dose \\nHigh Dose \\nFig. 8.

      "Page 7 raw text: 'These experiments, in conjunction with animal clinical\\ntrials ( Campbell et al., 2001; Ruehl et al., 1995 ), played a\\ncentral role in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approval for selegiline (Anipryl R) as a treatment for canine\\ncognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS), a term used byveterinarians to refer to a syndrome of behavioral dysfunc-tion associated with advanced age in dogs ( Ruehl and Hart,\\n1998 ). However, the efficacy of selegiline in the veterinary\\nclinic parallels that seen in our laboratory efficacy studies:\\nonly a subset of dogs seems to benefit and the clinicalrelevance is minimal ( Campbell et al., 2001 ). Furthermore,\\nno research has established long-term beneficial effects indogs. Finally, the end-point measures used by animal clinicalstudies are established by questionnaires, which are sub-jective and highly susceptible to placebo effects. In the caseof selegiline, these placebo effects could be further enhanced\\nbecause the drug produces low-level hyperactivity.\\nThe canine efficacy findings in the laboratory and\\nclinical settings, despite positive, parallel those observedin human clinical trials. Selegiline AD clinical trials werediscontinued because the improvement was minimal and theresponse was highly variable ( Birks and Flicker, 2003;\\nWilcock et al., 2002 ).\\n7. Adrafinil\\nCognitive enhancement is not only useful in dementia\\nbut also in healthy humans, particularly with normal age-related memory decline or when working long hours, suchas with air force pilots. Adrafinil is a potential perform-ance-enhancing pharmaceutical, which is currently used in\\nFrance as an anti-depressant. Current off-label uses\\ninclude increasing energy, reducing fatigue and improvingcognition.\\nWe conducted several pharmacokinetic and efficacy\\nstudies to characterize the effects of adrafinil on cognitionand arousal. We initially determined an optimal dose ofadrafinil by determining changes in spontaneous behaviorafter acute ( Siwak et al., 2000a ) and chronic administration\\n(p.o.) ( Siwak et al., 2000b ). Spontaneous locomotion, but\\nnot stereotypy, increased with increasing doses of adrafiniland lasted for approximately 10 h. The minimal dose for astatistically significant increase was 20 mg/kg.\\nWe used two paradigms to assess adrafinil’s cognitive-\\nenhancing effects. The first, a discrimination-learningparadigm, required the dog to learn which of two objectsalways covers the food reward. Adrafinil (20 mg/kg p.o.)\\nsignificantly improved the rate of discrimination learning in\\na population of aged dogs (see Fig. 2 in Milgram et al.,\\n2000 ). The second paradigm was the 3c-DNMP described\\nabove and was intended to provide a measure of theeffectiveness of adrafinil in enhancing working memory. Wefound, however, that the 20 mg/kg dose of adrafinil (p.o.),which was the dose that significantly improved discrim-ination learning, impaired working memory performance(see Fig. 1 in Siwak et al., 2003 ). A 10 mg/kg dose, by\\ncontrast, had no effect.\\nThese results are of general importance because they\\ndemonstrate task specific cognitive-enhancing effects. Wefound that treatment with adrafinil at a dose level of 20 mg/kgimproved learning; the same dose level, however, impairedperformance of a working memory task. Therefore, demon-strating that a drug improves learning in an animal model is\\nnot sufficient for predicting efficacy. As seen with adrafinil,\\nnot all cognitive processes are equally affected by acompound and, therefore, it is important to thoroughlyscreen a CET before proceeding to clinical trials. By contrast,we found enhancing effects on both memory and learningusing phenserine, which may be a more likely candidate toreceive regulatory approval as a CET. This suggests thatpositive results in multiple cognitive modalities may better\\npredict clinical outcome than a single positive result.\\nThe effects of adrafinil have not been tested in animal\\nmodels but several studies have examined at the effects ofmodafinil, the main metabolite of adrafinil. Beracochea et al.\\n(2002) showed that modafinil administration improves per-\\nformance of a delayed response task in mice. At present, it isunclear if modafinil enhances cognitive function in humans.\\n8. Conclusion\\nEstablishing pharmacological validity of an animal\\nmodel of AD is complicated by the absence of a robustgold standard and the fact that there are no cures for thedisease. The currently approved treatments, at best, producemoderate and transient improvements or a limited slowing\\nof the disease.\\nGenerally, however, our findings in the dog parallel those\\nobtained in human clinical trials ( Table 1 ). CP-118,954, an\\nAChE inhibitor, showed minimal cognitive enhancingeffects in dogs and human clinical trials were discontinued.By contrast, phenserine was able to improve learning andmemory in the dog and has shown positive effects onmemory in Phase IIb AD clinical trials. AChE inhibitors\\nalso showed beneficial effects in rodent models of AD.\\nHowever, as mentioned above, the few treatments availablefor AD make the ability to detect ineffective compounds asimportant as detecting true positives in an animal model.\\nTable 1\\nComparison of CET effects between species\\nCompound Rat model Canine model HumanCP-118,954 Unknown No effect Dropped after phase II\\nPhenserine +ve +ve Currently in phase IIIAmpakine +ve No effect\\n(/C0ve?)Failed phase IIb\\nSelegiline Mostly +ve No effect\\n(variability)Dropped (no effect,\\nvariability)\\nAdrafinil Unknown +ve learning,\\n/C0ve memoryNo effectC.M.

      "Page 8 raw text: 'The data summarized here further suggests that the dog\\nmodel is more effective at predicting inefficient compoundsthan the rodent models of AD ( Table 1 ). Ampakine and\\nselegiline are two compounds that showed positive effectsin the rodent. By contrast, the dog accurately predicted theresults seen in human clinical trials with first generationampakine: insignificant memory-enhancing effects inhumans or dogs. The response of aged dogs to selegiline\\nalso was similar to that of humans: beneficial effects were\\nminimal and highly variable.\\nFinally, the dog model may also be useful for predicting\\ncognitive modifying effects of drugs on healthy humans,which could include both cognitive enhancement andcognitive impairment. In dogs, adrafinil facilitated learningbut impaired working memory. These data illustrate theimportance of fully characterizing the effects of a CET on\\ncognition; a purported CET may not affect all cognitive\\nprocesses equally, possibly even impairing one whileimproving another. This is important, regardless of theanimal model used, and strongly suggests that a singlepositive finding in an animal model is not sufficient tomove a compound onto the human clinical trial phase.Thus, test batteries for assessing several cognitive modal-ities should be used in both preclinical and clinical trial\\ndesign.\\nThe current review is an initial attempt at assessing the\\npharmacological validity of the dog model of human agingand dementia. Generally, we have found the canine modelaccurate at predicting negative results and, to a morelimited extent, at predicting positive results. Thus far, theprimary limitation is the absence of a true gold standard inhuman cognitive therapeutics. This evidence of pharmaco-\\nlogical validity, in conjunction with the cognitive and\\nneuropathological parallels between dogs and humans,makes the dog model particularly useful for evaluatingnovel CETs. The canine model should provide a usefulscreening tool for reducing the number of ineffectivecompounds brought to clinical trials and, consequently,reduce the economic burden on pharmaceutical companiesand patients.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank A.D.F.

We were inter-\\nested in this issue because there is evidence that CCD may be\\nhighly under-diagnosed. For example, in a survey of owners of\\naged dogs reported by Landsberg and Araujo (2005) , 75% of dogs\\nhad at least one behavioural symptom indicative of cognitive dys-function, yet only 12% of owners had reported the change in behav-\\niour to their veterinarian. This is in keeping with the attitude notedbyOsella et al. (2007) that many owners were disinclined to be-\\nlieve that their dogs were showing any behavioural changes indic-ative of senility.\\nOur aim therefore, was to conduct a large epidemiological study\\nof older companion dogs that covered a broad range of physical,\\nsensory, motor, behavioural, cognitive and social content. Unbi-ased data-driven analytical techniques were then used to identify\\npotentially undiagnosed dogs with a behavioural proﬁle mirroring\\nthat of dogs with veterinary diagnosed CCD.\\nMaterials and methods\\nStudy design\\nThis study used a cross-sectional study design and has been reported in compli-\\nance with the STROBE statement ( Vandenbroucke et al., 2007 ). The senior dog sur-\\nvey (SDS) consisted of 84 items covering six sections, namely: (1) dog and owner\\ndetails, (2) management and health, (3) eating and drinking, (4) activity levels,\\n(5) behaviour (including aggression and house soiling), and (6) phobias. Each item\\nidentiﬁed both the frequency of a behaviour and the level of change in that behav-iour over the preceding 6 months. The questionnaire had approval from the HumanEthics Committee of the University of Sydney (Approval Number 10249).\\nStudy setting and participants\\nThe survey was distributed in online and hard copy formats and owners of dogs\\n8 years of age or older were invited to participate.

A hard copy version of the survey was pub-lished in DogsLife magazine,\\n3which has an estimated readership of 92,000 in Austra-\\nlia and New Zealand. Additional responses from the owners of dogs with veterinary\\ndiagnosed dementia (DEM) were obtained by approaching all veterinary clinics in\\nthe North Western Sydney area ( n= 20). Multiple types and areas of distribution were\\nused in an attempt to control for bias towards any particular dog managementsystem.\\nData measurement\\nUnﬁnished surveys and those describing dogs diagnosed with a neurological\\ndisease other than CCD were excluded from any analysis. All missing values werereplaced with the mean for that variable. Questions on behaviour frequency werescored from 1 (least) through to 5 (most). Questions on the change in behaviourwere also scored 1 (much less) through to 5 (much more), with ‘no change’ beingscored as 3.\\nStatistical analysis\\nThe entire survey sample was randomly split into two equal groups: Develop-\\nment and Test. An equal number of DEM dogs ( n= 9) were randomly assigned to\\neach group. The Development group was used in this study to estimate the preva-\\nlence rate and diagnosis rate of CCD in the community. The Test group was reservedas an independent sample for the validation of a diagnostic questionnaire and willbe reported in a later study.\\nTwo-step cluster analysis was used to identify nnaturalistic groups within the\\ndataset. Since CCD diagnosis was rare, the SDS sample was assumed to containthree cognitive groups: (1) DEM dogs (i.e. CCD or canine dementia with a veterinarydiagnosis); (2) unidentiﬁed ‘query’ CCD (qCCD) dogs with a behavioural proﬁle sim-ilar to that of DEM dogs but without a veterinary diagnosis; and (3) animals with nocognitive impairment (NCI).\\nTo identify possible qCCD dogs, each dog was assigned an overall score by sum-\\nming its scores for the signiﬁcant behaviours identiﬁed in the cluster analysis. Thenumerical threshold for qCCD diagnosis was set to the overall score of the lowestranked DEM dog. Non-DEM dogs which scored on or above the threshold were cat-egorised as qCCD.\\nDogs were split into three longevity groups based on published estimated life\\nexpectancies ( Michell, 1999 ): short-lived, 611 years; medium-lived, 11–13 years;\\nand long-lived, >13 years. All purebred dogs were also split into three size groupsbased on heights (at the shoulder) stated in the breed standard: small, <35 cm high;\\nmedium, 35–55 cm high; and large, >55 cm.\\nSPSS version 15.0 was used for cluster analysis and v17.0 was used for all\\nremaining statistical analyses. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used\\nto determine any age effects in the sample. Multivariate generalised linear model(GLM) was used to correct for multiple testing and age when comparing behavioursbetween cognitive groups. Binary logistic regression was used to investigate anydifferences in disease burden between DEM and non-DEM groups. It was also usedto determine any difference in CCD prevalence in longevity and size groups after\\ncorrection for age. Independent samples ttests were used to investigate any age dif-\\nferences in the longevity and size groups. The signiﬁcance threshold was set at\\nP= 0.05 for all analysis unless otherwise speciﬁed.\\nResults\\nSenior dog survey\\nA total of 1100 surveys were obtained of which 957 were eligi-\\nble for inclusion. Eligible responses were obtained from 11 coun-\\ntries, predominantly Australia (n = 501), the United States\\n(n= 342), New Zealand (n = 51) and the UK (n = 41). Eight hundred\\nand forty-two eligible responses were obtained via the online ver-\\nsion of the survey, 111 eligible responses were returned through\\nDogsLife magazine and four eligible responses were obtained\\nthrough veterinary practices. The average proportion of missingvalues across all variables was low (1.3%).\\nIn the complete sample, 18 dogs were reported as having a for-\\nmal diagnosis of ‘dementia’ or CCD by a veterinarian (DEM). DEM\\ndogs (13 years 8 months) were signiﬁcantly older than non-DEMdogs (11 years 8 months, P= 0.004). The top three most prevalent\\ndiseases in all dogs were: arthritis (n = 518); deafness (n = 290);\\nand blindness ( n= 226). After correction for age, DEM dogs had a\\nnon-signiﬁcant trend towards increased prevalence of blindness(Odds ratio [OR] = 2.93; conﬁdence interval [CI] = 0.966–8.875;\\nP= 0.058).\\nSample characteristics\\nThe mean age of surveyed dogs was 11 years 9 months\\n(8 years–19 years 8 m). There were 109 different pedigree breedsand 203 crossbred dogs represented. Female dogs (54.8%) slightly\\noutnumbered male dogs (44.6%). The majority of dogs were de-\\nsexed: 84.3% of males and 94.1% of females.\\nOn several key basic descriptive criteria (age, sex, disease bur-\\nden), there were no systematic differences between the Develop-ment and Test groups. Only data from the Development group\\n(n= 479) were used in this study and subsequently will be exclu-\\nsively discussed.\\nTwo-step cluster analysis\\nCluster analysis distinguished between dogs without (Group I)\\nand with (Group II) behavioural dysfunction: Group I comprised\\nno DEM animals and 75% of the non-DEM dogs, whilst Group II\\ncomprised 100% of the DEM dogs and 24.9% of the non-DEM dogs.\\nGroup II behavioural proﬁle\\nWe further investigated whether the 24.9% of the non-DEM\\ndogs included in Group II were exhibiting a behavioural proﬁle\\nsimilar to diagnosed DEM animals. Multiple (uncorrected) univar-\\niate ttest comparisons found 30 signiﬁcantly different behavioural\\nitems between Groups I and II. This was reduced to 27 items aftercorrection for age and multiple comparisons (Table 1 ).\\nNeurobehavioural similarity of qCCD and DEM\\nThe mean sum of behavioural scores for the 27 signiﬁcant\\nbehaviours were 111 (range 88–141) for DEM dogs and 73 (range59–141) for non-DEM dogs ( Fig. 1 ). The threshold for qCCD was\\ntherefore set at a summed behavioural score of 88 or above. Onehundred percent of qCCD dogs were from the Group II DEM cluster.\\nThe behavioural proﬁle of qCCD and DEM dogs was signiﬁcantly\\ndifferent from NCI dogs across all 27 signiﬁcant behaviours. After\\ncorrection for multiple comparisons and age, DEM and qCCD dogs\\nwere not signiﬁcantly different across all 27 behaviours.\\nEstimated prevalence and diagnosis rates\\nFifty-nine non-DEM dogs were classiﬁed as qCCD, giving an\\nestimated prevalence rate for CCD (qCCD + DEM) of 14.2% (68/\\n479). The rate of veterinary diagnosis reported was, by contrast,\\nmuch lower at 1.9% (9/479). There was an exponential increase\\nin the estimated prevalence of CCD with increasing age\\n(F= 54.62; df = 478, P< 0.0001; linear contrast P< 0.0001, qua-\\ndratic contrast P< 0.0001, cubic contrast, P= 0.373; see Fig. 2 ).\\nBreed differences\\nBreed longevity estimates could be applied to 386 dogs and size\\ncategories to 376 dogs. As expected, dogs of short-lived breeds\\nwere signiﬁcantly\\nyounger than those of long-lived breeds\\n(P= 0.001) and large dogs were signiﬁcantly younger than small\\ndogs ( P< 0.001).

Although some reports suggest that CCD is a common\\ndisorder of aged dogs ( Neilson et al., 2001; Osella et al., 2007; Azk-\\nona et al., 2009 ), neurocognitive behavioural changes are com-\\nmonly ignored or regarded by owners as part of the normal\\nageing process (Landsberg and Araujo, 2005; Osella et al., 2007 ).\\nIn our study, the estimated CCD prevalence rate amongst oldercommunity based dogs was 14.2%, in contrast to a veterinary diag-\\nnosis rate of only 1.9%.\\nWhilst previous prevalence studies used veterinary records to\\nrule out the presence of other organic causes of behavioural\\nchange, we relied on the owners’ notiﬁcation of co-morbid disease.\\nIt is possible that organic causes of behavioural change not identi-\\nﬁed by owners could have decreased the precision of our preva-\\nlence estimate. It is, however, unlikely that our estimate of\\nprevalence was artiﬁcially inﬂated since previous studies have re-\\nported considerably higher ﬁgures (Neilson et al., 2001; OsellaTable 1\\nList of 30 behavioural items identiﬁed as signiﬁcant in exploratory two-step clusteranalysis and their levels of signiﬁcance after correction for age differences.\\na\\nBehaviour P-value\\nAbnormal locomotion: pacing; circling; and/or wandering 0.000*\\nStaring blankly at the walls or ﬂoor 0.000*\\nChange in abnormal locomotion 0.000*\\nChange in staring blankly 0.000*\\nFailure to recognise familiar people or pets 0.000*\\nGetting stuck behind objects or furniture 0.000*\\nWalking into walls or furniture 0.000*\\nChange in obedience/response to commands 0.000*\\nChange in recognition of familiar people or pets 0.000*\\nChange in getting stuck behind objects or furniture 0.000*\\nOrientating to the hinge side of doors to be let out 0.000*\\nChange in walking into walls or furniture 0.000*\\nStanding over the water bowl but not drinking 0.000*\\nFrequency of house soiling 0.000*\\nDifﬁculty ﬁnding dropped food 0.000*\\nChange in excitement for walks or outings 0.000*\\nFrequency of waking during the night 0.000*\\nAvoiding being petted or touched 0.000*\\nChange in the frequency of house soiling 0.000*\\nTime taken to learn new tasks 0.000*\\nLevel of excitement for walks or outings 0.000*\\nChange in the percentage of active time spent\\nin activities other than playing0.000*\\nChange in difﬁculty ﬁnding dropped food 0.000*\\nChange in vocalising at nothing or for no reason 0.000*\\nEnthusiasm to greet the owner after a separation 0.000*\\nChange in time spent inactive per day 0.000*\\nObedience/response to commands 0.000*\\nFrequency of breed-typical behaviours displayed NS\\nTime spent inactive per day NS\\nTime spent chewing bones or toys NS\\naAlpha level set at P< 0.0017 to control for multiple comparisons.\\n*Denotes a signiﬁcant item after correction for age and multiple comparisons.\\nFig. 1.

      "Page 4 raw text: 'et al., 2007; Azkona et al., 2009 ). The use of the Internet to dissem-\\ninate the survey also introduces the possibility that a more highly\\neducated, higher income, urban population of dog owners was\\nsampled compared to the general population (Australian Bureau\\nof Statistics, 2007 ). However, both the large sample size and our\\nrecruitment of community based (rather than veterinary clinicbased) dogs greatly increase the generalised nature of this study.\\nOur approach also had some methodological strengths over pre-\\nvious studies. The behavioural items were highly speciﬁc and had\\nobjective anchors to the ﬁve response options. Our estimates were\\nalso based on a larger sample size than any previous studies\\n(which ranged in size from 102 to 325 dogs). Additionally the\\nSDS was distributed to a wide range of dog owners through several\\nmedia types and the sex and de-sexing distribution aligned well\\nwith previous surveys (McGreevy et al., 2005; Masters and McG-\\nreevy, 2007 ). Data-driven analytical techniques allowed grouping\\nof dogs into naturalistic clusters instead of relying on a precon-\\nceived deﬁnition of CCD.\\nThis automated approach appears to have captured important\\naspects of the CCD proﬁle. Behaviours which contributed to the\\nqCCD cluster overlap signiﬁcantly with those identiﬁed as relevant\\nbased on clinical expertise. For example, the DISHA domains,\\ndeveloped by a veterinarian to identify behavioural changes indic-\\native of cognitive dysfunction, cover disorientation, social interac-\\ntions, sleep/wake cycle disturbances, loss of housetraining/other\\nlearned behaviours and changes in activity levels (Landsberg\\net al., 2003 ). All of these broad behavioural domains were repre-\\nsented in the 27 behavioural items which deﬁned our qCCD group.Furthermore, cluster analysis aggregated qCCD and veterinary-\\ndiagnosed DEM animals into one group in contradistinction to cog-\\nnitively-intact animals, and qCCD dogs were signiﬁcantly different\\nfrom NCI dogs across all 27 behavioural items after correction for\\nage. Finally, as found in previous studies, the rate of CCD appeared\\nto increase exponentially with age (Neilson et al., 2001; Azkonaet al., 2009 ). Query CCD as deﬁned here is therefore suggested to\\nbe indicative of an undiagnosed age-related cognitive dysfunctionsyndrome. Under diagnosis of CCD is a potentially signiﬁcant issue\\nin older companion animals.\\nSomewhat unexpectedly there was no evidence that age-related\\ncognitive dysfunction varied across dog breeds. It is well estab-\\nlished that small dogs live longer than large dogs (Patronek et al.,\\n1997 ) and an ‘accelerated cell ageing’ hypothesis (Galis et al.,\\n2007 ) would have predicted that larger dogs have an increased\\nprevalence of CCD at a younger age than small dogs. In contrast,\\nthe results here suggest that prevalence of age-related neurobeha-\\nvioural dysfunction is similar across the size and longevity groups.\\nThese ﬁndings are consistent with those of Azkona et al. (2009)\\nwho found that size was not identiﬁed as a predictor for CCD.\\nFinally, it is relevant to speculate on the reasons for the low rate\\nof formal diagnosis of CCD in community-dwelling dogs. Many fac-tors may contribute, including a lack of awareness about this dis-\\norder, and an unwillingness to accept and report behaviouralchanges indicative of CCD. In addition, the lack of a clear and val-\\nidated diagnostic assessment tool limits diagnosis of CCD in veter-\\ninary practice, and helps perpetuate the misplaced assumption\\nthat CCD is part of ‘ normal ’ age-related change. These areas clearly\\nwarrant further research as the prevalence estimates in this andother studies suggest that CCD has a major impact on the lives\\nand welfare of a large proportion of aged dogs.\\nConclusions\\nThe estimated prevalence rate of CCD in community based dogs\\nwas 14.2% in dogs over the age of 8 years, yet the rate of diagnosis\\nwas extremely low with only 1.9% of older dogs having been clin-\\nically diagnosed. CCD does not appear to discriminate between\\nbreed groups and is an international problem. Given the increasing\\nnumber of older dogs in the community and the strong link be-\\ntween dogs and their carers, it is hoped that this research will facil-\\nitate an increase in the awareness of CCD within the community\\nand in veterinary practice.\\nConﬂict of interest statement\\nNone of the authors of this paper has a ﬁnancial or personal\\nrelationship with other people or organisations that could inappro-\\npriately inﬂuence or bias the content of the paper.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was funded by NHMRC Program Grant 350833.

L. Roshier, E. A. McBride\\nThe veterinary profession recently acknowledged its responsibility to provide behaviour \\nsupport, following criticism for focussing on the physiological aspects of welfare and overlooking the psychological. To further understand the practising of behavioural medicine, a ‘fly-on-the-wall’ approach was used to investigate welfare discussions during dog booster vaccinations. Seventeen consultations involving six veterinarians in two UK small-animal practices were videoed. Qualitative methods were used to analyse themes discussed and questionnaires completed to obtain participant information and perceptions. Five main topics of discussion were identified: navigation, medical, husbandry, behaviour and cost. Veterinarians led the discussion of all topics except behaviour which was instigated approximately equally by veterinarian and client. All clients reported one or more behaviours that were a concern to them, totalling 58 across the sample. Disconcertingly, only 10 were discussed during consultations and none fully explored nor managed beyond the consultation. Behaviour discussion varies between veterinarians; this may reflect their experience, confidence or clients’ requests. Owners access welfare information from a variety of sources, not always from veterinarians. Where sources are not knowledgeable, both human and animal welfare can be seriously compromised. Veterinarians need to ensure that clients are enabled to discuss behaviour issues and are provided with appropriate support, be that in-house or via referral.\\nIntroduction\\nUnder the Animal W elfare Act 2006 (Section 9) (HMSO 2006) owners \\nare legally obliged to provide for the welfare of animals in their care. \\nAnimal welfare consists of three distinct, but overlapping domains:  \\n(i) health and physiological functioning (body); (ii) affective state \\n(mind) and (iii) social functioning, including normal development, \\nbehaviour and temperament (nature) (Duncan and Fraser 1997). T o \\nhelp owners fulfil their obligation, Codes of Practice (DEFRA 2009) are available, which advise owners to seek additional support from veterinarians and other relevant professionals. With their multidisci-\\nplinary training and direct contact with owners, it would seem that \\nveterinarians are in a prime position to advise on the three domains of welfare. However, the provision of behaviour support has been ques-\\ntioned (McMillan and Rollin 2001) and veterinary curricula criticised \\nas being deficient in training of behaviour and ethology (Christiansen and Forkman 2007, Wickens 2007), an omission also acknowledged \\nby the profession (Anon 2007). More recently , the profession has highlighted that behaviour is an area veterinarians should support \\n(FVE and A VMA 2011) either directly , or indirectly by referral.\\nThe focus of the veterinary consultation can be broadly catego-\\nrised into three groups:\\n1. Presentation of an animal with a health problem\\n2. An animal returning for follow-up treatment\\n3. Routine appointments (eg, vaccination, health check), also referred \\nto as wellness appointments.\\nThe type of consultation shapes the discussions that take place. \\nShaw and others (2008) investigated communication between vet-\\nerinarian, client and patient during wellness appointments, and com-\\npared this with appointments involving a health problem. Findings revealed that 90 per cent of conversation in a health problem consulta-\\ntion is the veterinarian gathering biomedical information, whereas in \\nwellness appointments, 50 per cent of the conversation is related to information gathering, and 27 per cent on client education. This sug-\\ngests that wellness appointments present a situation where conversa-\\ntions relevant to this study are most likely to occur. Clients typically visit veterinarians when their animal is unwell; therefore, for animals \\nin good health, the annual booster vaccination may provide the only \\nopportunity to discuss welfare issues.\\nW elfare support involves detection of a problem, anamnesis, \\nassessment and provision of appropriate means of resolution. Initial detection of a problem, particularly a behaviour issue, involves appropriate communication with the owner. This requires both a \\nknowledge base from which to form pertinent questions and lis-\\ntening skills. As stated above, there are concerns regarding behav-iour knowledge of veterinarians, and research also indicates lack of \\ncommunication skills (Dysart and others 2011), which would be Veterinary Record (2012) doi: 10.1136/vr.101125\\nA.

      "Page 2 raw text: 'Paper\\nVeterinary Record | March 2, 2013exacerbated by the short length of most consultations (Roshier and \\nMcBride 2012).\\nIt is unclear what welfare support owners seek from veterinarians, \\nparticularly regarding behaviour advice. T o explore this, both parties could be asked directly through questionnaires or interviews. However, \\nthis information may be limited, as what people think they do, or what \\nthey would like others to think they do, does not always represent the reality . T o capture reality , consultations can be observed directly , thus \\nproviding a primary source of information. Following observations, par -\\nticipants could be further questioned. This multifaceted approach ena -\\nbles collection of rich data and a deeper understanding of participants and events (W arne and McAndrew 2009). Where raw data is gathered \\nand themes emerge, this is described as a general inductive research approach  \\n(Thomas 2006), and is deemed appropriate for the study of complex \\nsocial settings and in exploratory early stages of research.\\nObservations can be made directly or through video recordings. \\nThe use of video cameras to record doctor-patient consultations has been shown to neither influence doctors’ behaviour (Pringle and \\nStewart-Evans 1990), nor affect how patients feel (Arborelius and Timpka 1990, Latvala and others 2000), and most patients were happy \\nto give informed consent to be recorded (Martin and Martin 1984). \\nIn veterinary medicine, it has been used to evaluate veterinarian-client interactions (Shaw and others 2008, Everitt 2011) and to encourage \\nreflective practice (Manning 2008).\\nThis study sought to explore discussions and focussed analysis \\non verbal communication. Boyatzis (1998) recommends full analysis which involves producing transcripts of complete conversations and \\nidentifying themes. This rigorous approach minimises personal per-spectives influencing the reporting, which can occur when researchers \\nprovide general reconstructions of what was said (Seale 1999).\\nOwners have a legal responsibility to ensure their dog’s welfare. \\nThe veterinarian is a recommended source for information relating to animal welfare according to Codes of Practice. This study explored the \\nwelfare support provided by veterinarians, that is, how they ensured owners were able to fully comply with their legal obligation. This \\ninvolved both directly observing discussions during a dog’s annual \\nbooster vaccination and questionnaires.\\nMaterials and methods\\nThe study was approved by the University of Southampton Ethics Committee and Research Governance Office.\\nParticipants\\nStudy invitations were sent to eight small-animal practices in the first author’s (ALR) locality , within 40 miles of Nottingham, UK; and an \\nopportunistic sample of two were recruited. Study posters were dis-\\nplayed in the waiting room to recruit clients. Reception identified clients meeting the study criteria and, on arrival for their appointment, intro -\\nduced them to the author who provided further details. Six veterinar-ians participated (three male and three female, age range: 23–55 years). \\nT wenty-one clients met selection criteria and were invited to partici-\\npate in the study; four declined to participate. Seventeen consultations \\nwere analysed in total and included 17 owners (7 male and 10 female, age range: 18–85 years) and 17 dogs (10 male and 7 female, age range: \\n13–39 months, 14 pure breeds, 3 crossbreeds, 12 neutered).\\nThe selection criteria were:\\n•\\tDogs: not attending for medical reasons but for their annual booster vaccination. Aged 12–42 months – around the age when \\nmost problem behaviours are reported (Lund and others 1996).\\n•\\tClients: the dog’s owner and over 18 years (unless accompanied \\nby a guardian).\\nData collection\\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants. Conversational data of the consultation were collected using a compact and discretely \\nlocated digital camcorder (Panasonic HDC-TM60). Immediately after \\nthe consultation, owners were asked to complete a paper question-naire, to collect data regarding demographics and their views of the \\nconsultation; this took approximately 10  minutes to complete. The \\nquestionnaires are published in Roshier and McBride (2012).Owner questionnaire\\nThe owner questionnaire was divided into three sections. It comprised \\nclosed questions, Likert scales, free text opportunities and Visual \\nAnalogue Scales (V AS). The latter were a 10 cm horizontal line with \\ndescriptors written at the extremities; respondents marked a cross on \\nthe line to indicate their rating, this was measured with a ruler and \\nconverted into a percentage (1 cm=10 per cent).\\nThe first section sought demographic information about the \\nowner and anyone accompanying them into the consultation. Owners rated their experience with dogs on a V AS.\\nThe second section collected data about the dog’s demographics, \\nthe owner’s perception of their dog’s behaviour in the veterinary clinic and in general, using 5-point Likert scales to assess the frequency their \\ndog performed 18 behaviours, and a 3-point scale to rate how much of a problem it was to the owner. The behaviours chosen are often \\nconsidered problematic (Overall 1997).\\nThe third section asked owners how long they had been visiting \\nthe practice, and their acquaintance with the veterinarian. Owners were asked to evaluate their experience of the consultation using the \\nvalidated 15-item Likert scale client satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ) developed by Coe and others (2010), and to identify any issues not \\ndiscussed, and why . The final question asked what resources clients \\nnormally access for information on eight different areas relevant to their dog’s welfare (eg, breeding, diet, behaviour problems).\\nData analyses\\nThe small sample size precluded application of inferential statistics and, therefore, descriptive statistics and qualitative methods were used.\\nQuestionnaire data – responses were entered in a standard spread-\\nsheet (Microsoft Office Excel 2007). Data were entered twice to iden-tify data entry errors. Responses were analysed using descriptive statis-\\ntics and qualitative methods (for open-ended questions). Questionnaire \\nresponses were considered in respect to consultation observations.\\nObservation data – conversations were transcribed in a text docu-\\nment (Microsoft Office W ord 2007) for coding and thematic analy-sis (Boyatzis 1998). Thematic analysis was guided by the following research questions:\\n•\\t What\\t welfare\\tissues\\tare\\tdiscussed?\\n•\\t Who\\t instigates\\t these\\twelfare\\tconversations?\\nFollowing coding, the participant who instigated discussion of the \\ntopic was noted. Thematic and instigation data were analysed using descriptive statistics.\\nResults\\nTopics identified\\nThe mean duration of the 17 consultation appointments was nine minutes (range: 5–15 minutes). Thematic analysis of tran-\\nscripts identified 53 subthemes which were categorised into five main themes representing topics of discussion: (i) navigation, (ii) medical, \\n(iii) husbandry , (iv) behaviour and (v) cost (T able 1).\\nInstigation of topic discussion\\nOf the five topics identified, four were discussed in all 17 consulta -\\ntions (navigation, medical, husbandry , behaviour); cost was men-tioned least, featuring in five consultations. Contributions made by \\nveterinarians or clients to the discussion topics were considered by comparing the total number of statements instigated by each group \\n(Fig 1). V eterinarians led navigation of the consultation as indicated \\nby a greater number of statement instigations (n= 55/61) than clients \\n(n=6/61), as were discussions of cost (vets n =7/8, clients n =1/8). The \\nnumber of statements instigated relating to medical (vets n= 155/195, \\nclients 40/195) and husbandry themes (vets n= 117/163, clients \\nn=46/163) indicated that veterinarians led the discussion of these top-\\nics, with contributions from clients. Instigation of behaviour discus-sion was shared between veterinarians and clients (vets n= 55/122, \\nclients n=67/122), and was the least discussed welfare topic.\\nBehaviour discussion during consultations\\nClients’ evaluation of the frequency their dog performed 18 behaviours (see Box), and the extent to which this was a problem to the client are \\n 20427670, 2013, 9, Downloaded from https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1136/vr.101125 by Readcube-Labtiva, Wiley Online Library on [24/03/2025].

Of these 58 behaviour concerns, 10 were mentioned dur-\\ning the consultation. Of these 58 concerns, 48 were considered by the owner to be ‘a bit of a problem’ . Of these 48, nine were mentioned in \\nthe consultation by eight of the 17 clients. Five clients (C2, C4, C15, \\nC16, C17) indicated at least one behaviour they considered to be ‘a big problem’; this totalled 10 problems. These ‘big problems’ included:  \\n(i) pull on the lead (C17), (ii) jump up at people (C2, C15), (iii) show signs of fear of fireworks (C2, C4), (iv) chew/eat your possessions (C4), (v) run off/roam/escape (C4), (vi) bark or howl when left alone (C16), \\n(vii) bark at passers-by (C16), (viii) guard their food/toys (C4). Only \\none client (C15) mentioned the ‘big problem’ to their veterinarian; this was a problem of jumping up at people, but this was not fully \\nexplored. T wo clients (C9, C10) mentioned a behaviour they had indi-\\ncated their dog rarely performed and was not a problem to them.\\nIn two consultations (C11 and C16), dogs were muzzled in order \\nto carry out the physical examination and vaccination. In both cases, it was the veterinarian’s decision to muzzle; (C16) because the dog snapped at the veterinarian (although at the end of the consultation \\nit transpired that the owners had a muzzle that the dog should have \\nbeen wearing), (C11) because it was on the dog’s record that a muzzle would be required.\\nIn total, 58 problems were identified by owners. Only 10 were \\nmentioned in the consultations (T able 2).

The satisfaction ratings were similar \\nacross all clients irrespective of their acquaintance with the veterinar-\\nian or whether behaviour problems were discussed. Only two clients rated satisfaction below excellent (C6-very good, C7-good).

V eterinarians led navigation of the consul-tation, which indicates managing the framework of the appointment. V eterinarians instigated the majority of medical and husbandry discus-\\nsions; however, clients also made contributions. Regarding behaviour, \\nequal contributions were made by veterinarians and clients implying a shared discussion of this topic. Cost was infrequently mentioned \\nwhich is consistent with others’ findings (Coe and others 2009). In \\nthe context of the booster consultation, this is not surprising, as a standard fee was probably anticipated for this routine appointment; \\nor for clients subscribing to the practice club this appointment would \\nalready be paid for. Care must be taken when extrapolating meaning from instigation data. Quantification by instigation is limited in that \\nit is not clear how long discussions lasted, the questions or comments \\nmade, or the quality of the information provided.Discussions relating to behaviour\\nThough clients contributed to discussion of medical and husbandry issues, these topics were more likely to be instigated by the veterinar-\\nian. They consistently included the subthemes of weight, flea and \\nworming treatments. The client’s instigation of these topics prob -\\nably reflects media awareness, especially as obesity is a human health \\nconcern. Also, these aspects of animal care are more tangible, where \\nweight can be measured and monitored; flea and worming are routine procedures for owners to implement. Neither topic requires ‘prior’ \\nowner knowledge, unlike identifying behaviour issues where often \\nthe onus is on the owner to recognise and report a problem that may not be apparent in the clinic. Discussions of behaviour were instigated \\napproximately equally by veterinarian and client.\\nThe majority of the owner participants indicated they were experi-\\nenced dog owners. Even experienced owners can misinterpret their dog’s behaviour (Horowitz and Horowitz 2009, T ami and Gallagher 2009) \\nand, therefore, underestimate problems. Clients’ interpretations of their dog’s behaviour and whether this indicated the dog did or did \\nnot like coming to the practice, suggested that many of these clients \\nwere perceptive to behaviour and may interpret some of it accurately .

Separation-related vocalisations may indicate an anxiety issue. \\nSeveral clients rated this as ‘no problem’ (C1, C12, C14 where fre -\\nquency was sometimes, and C3, C7 where frequency was rarely), \\nperhaps this rating was because of the frequency of the problem \\nor thinking that barking is acceptable behaviour, and/or because it occurs when they are away from the home the barking does not \\ndirectly affect them. However, the dog’s welfare may be compro-\\nmised, it could be a nuisance to neighbours, and there are potential legal implications for the owner. Alternatively , perhaps a rating of no \\nproblem indicates the client’s willingness to work through the prob-\\nlem. Further questioning would be needed to clarify if the owners had obtained advice about the problem, and to clarify whether such \\nadvice was appropriate.\\nWhere clients identified multiple concerns, these were not neces-\\nsarily discussed. A few clients mentioned behaviours they considered problematic, and a missed opportunity occurs when such remarks are \\nnot fully explored by the veterinarian. An example of this was a client who rated their dogs jumping up behaviour as ‘a big problem’ . During \\nthe consultation they asked the veterinarian if the dog’s nails needed \\ntrimming:\\nV et: I guess because she jumps up a lot you feel her scratching.\\nClient: Oh it’s terrible, she bruises me terribly she does.\\nV et: UhuhClient: Don’t you?\\nThe jumping up behaviour was not discussed further. The client \\nmentioned earlier in the consultation that the dog was lively and they used a harness to help handle her on walks. In such scenarios, clients may appreciate the opportunity to discuss training or their veterinar-\\nian’s advice on where to seek appropriate support. In addition, veteri-\\nnarians may be considered to have an obligation to suggest such routes and advise owners of the potential legal ramifications of their pet’s \\nbehaviour, which can be extensive and extremely costly , even for such \\na case as this.\\nIt is possible that problems rated as ‘a bit of a problem’ may be \\ntolerated and go unstated until they become escalated (Horwitz 2008). However, five clients identified ‘a big problem’ and only one client mentioned this, and then possibly only because the behaviour (jump-\\ning up) was evident during the consultation.\\nSeveral dogs required muzzling during the consultation. Not only \\ndid this restrict the clinical examination able to be performed, but there are also implications of this behaviour outside of the consulta-\\ntion. Only one veterinarian asked how the dog behaved with other people, and the client acknowledged that the dog could be aggressive \\ntowards his wife, though it was unclear if this extended to others. \\nUnfortunately , although the veterinarian prompted this disclosure, it was not explored further. The implications of this behaviour outside \\nof the clinic are manifold, for example, compromised welfare (dog and \\nhuman), potential injury to owners and others, deterioration of the animal-owner and owner-owner bonds, criminal legal proceedings. \\nThe behaviour displayed by these dogs indicated that they would ben-\\nefit from behaviour support. Of course, not all issues will present in the clinic, for example, one client identified their dog was territorial at \\nhome and calm at the veterinary practice, and therefore, these prob-\\nlems can go undetected unless the client is questioned.\\nThis lack of mentioning behaviour, and thus detecting and being \\nable to address problems at an early stage, is regrettable and has wel-fare implications for animal and owner. Generally , the longer a behav-iour problem exists, the more established it becomes and the more \\ndifficult it is to change. This is particularly so for those that involve fear and/or aggression (Horwitz and others 2002). In addition, the \\nowner’s bond with the animal is likely to be damaged to the point that \\nrelinquishment or even euthanasia is the favoured option (Salman and \\nothers 2000).\\nWhy behaviours were only mentioned in passing or not at all will \\nnow be considered.\\nBarriers to discussion\\nA client-centred approach leads to increased client satisfaction (Kinnersley and others 1999) and enables clients to express their con-\\ncerns. Although veterinarians offered a variation on the question ‘do \\nyou\\thave\\tany\\tconcerns?’,\\t two\\tmain\\tbarriers\\tto\\texpressing\\t concerns \\t\\nare recognised: (i) psychological barrier: where respondents are anxious \\nor embarrassed to mention something because it is serious, perceived \\nas socially unacceptable, embarrassing or it feels trivial; (ii) interac-tional barrier : respondents tend not to mention concerns randomly \\nbut require conversation flow to facilitate introduction of new topics (Robinson 2001).\\nOne aspect of overcoming the first psychological barrier includes \\ndeveloping trust and rapport and having a ‘safe’ environment to encourage disclosure. Possibly , there is no opportunity to foster such a relationship, particularly if clients visit infrequently , for a short con-\\nsultation, or they do not have a regular veterinarian. Developing the \\nclient’s trust requires the employment of good questioning and listen-ing skills. Research indicates these areas need further addressing in \\nveterinary education (Dysart and others 2011, Roshier and McBride \\n2012). Perhaps those clients who discuss concerns with reception staff do so because frequent interactions occur here, and clients may feel \\nmore at ease with this team.\\nOvercoming the second interactional barrier relies on creating \\nopportunities to raise concerns. Particularly pertinent is the finding that some clients do not think they should mention behaviour in a \\nmedical appointment (Bergman and others 2002). It seems advisable for veterinarians to inquire about behaviour directly , as this approach \\nappeared effective for stimulating discussion on other aspects, for \\nexample,\\t ‘any\\tlumps\\tor\\tbumps?’:\\nV et: Any lumps or bumps that you’ve noticed at all?Client F: No, no.Client M: No.\\nClient F: The only one she got really was, was it around here? was it? like \\ner, er like a mole or something.\\nClient satisfaction scoring of consultations was generally very \\nhigh and no unstated concerns were disclosed in the questionnaire. \\nTherefore, other possibilities for not discussing behaviour concerns \\ncould be:\\n1. Concerns are discussed at another time, or with another practice \\nmember. This is possible given the wellness pet scheme employed at the sample practices. This scheme provides owners the opportu-\\nnity to visit veterinarians and nurses for additional appointments \\n(eg, weight check, general examination). In addition, as previously mentioned, a member of reception staff may be perceived as more \\napproachable than the veterinarian.\\n2. The perceived timeliness of the problem, for example, firework \\nphobias, are discussed at certain times of the year (Sheppard and \\nMills 2003), or when the problem has escalated. In either case, \\nmore efficacious help may have been provided if it had been dis -\\ncussed earlier.\\n3. Clients did not realise behaviour support was available; one study found that owners did not realise they could speak to their veteri-narian about noise phobias (Blackwell and others 2005), and this \\nmay also be true for other behaviour issues.\\n4. Clients are not confident in the behaviour support offered by the \\nveterinarian, so do not ask, or\\n5. Clients choose to access behaviour support elsewhere.\\nThe People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) recently pro-\\nduced an Animal W ellbeing (P A W) Report (PDSA 2011) that iden-tified that owners do not access all the support available to them, including from their veterinarians. Therefore, it would have been use -\\nful to have asked those clients who identified behaviour concerns in \\n 20427670, 2013, 9, Downloaded from https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1136/vr.101125 by Readcube-Labtiva, Wiley Online Library on [24/03/2025].

Only C1 suggested an \\nadditional area of support, and this was for guidance on socialisation \\nof their dog. This owner indicated that they would speak to their veterinary practice but not a behaviourist for advice. Perhaps they \\nviewed behaviourists as providing support for established behaviour \\nproblem issues and not for supportive or preventative advice. Further studies are needed to find out why clients seek behaviour informa-\\ntion, or why they choose not to, and what influences the choice of \\nsources of support.\\nConclusion\\nThe intention of this study was to provide an initial investigation into the relationship between veterinarians and the addressing of problem \\nbehaviour, focussing on one scenario in the veterinary practice, that \\nis, dogs having their annual booster. It was a small sample and cannot be considered to provide a representative view of the profession and \\nits clients.\\nThe data indicated that there was a paucity of assessment of \\nbehaviour concerns, even though these are potentially seriously det-rimental to welfare. Assessment of how an animal behaves in vari-\\nous situations should be an integral aspect of veterinary examination. Appropriate further support can be offered directly , or indirectly by \\nreferral.\\nThe study findings have highlighted areas for future research to \\nfurther understand the practising of behavioural medicine. Clients indicated they would source support from the veterinary practice, \\nthough not necessarily from the veterinarian. Therefore, other sce-narios in the veterinary practice should be explored, including services \\nprovided by other staff, different consultation formats, and the sup-\\nport provided to other species. A greater understanding of how own-ers address behaviour concerns is needed, including their reasons for \\nmaking these choices. Understanding the needs of owners and ani-\\nmals enables the opportunities for the veterinary profession to sup-port behaviour welfare to be optimised. When support is not accessed \\nor provided, animal welfare, the human-animal bond, and the dog’s \\nimpact on society can be compromised.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors would like to thank the veterinarians and owners who took part in the study .

We have a vet appointment tomorrow but after nearly 24 hours of straight aggression I’m considering doing what I believe the humane thing would be. \\n\\nNow before anyone says anything please let me explain and I’m happy to receive constructive feedback.\\n\\nI’ve had my (4 year old) female cat since 6 weeks old. Ever since getting her she has been violent. I initially let some of her behavior slide as she was a kitten but clearly she never grew out of this behavior. By a year old she had attacked me 3-4 times if not more over peeing on my bed/random events. These weren’t just small scratches. She would explode, bushy tail big eyes, screaming and spitting. I took her to the vet multiple times only to be told this was behavioral. \\n\\nNow in the past 4 years I’ve been attacked more times than I can count. She’s tried attacking every roommate I’ve had, most people that come over and my other cat. I personally have been the only one mauled enough to the point of blood and scars. Never had to go to the ER but horrible enough that I’m physically scared on multiple parts of my body. \\n\\nAgain I’ve been to the vet after each incident. Never once receiving medication for the behavior. I was told she has crystals in her urine and that a wet food diet will fix this. I made the switch and didn’t see a change. \\n\\nLast night was probably one of the worst attacks in awhile. I take a lot of blame as our apartment has been extremely stressful for the past month. See my last post. \\n\\n24 hours later I let her out of my room and she’s still hissing and spitting at me. I’m scared to even get her into her crate to be seen by the vet. I have a TNR trap I’m going to use but probably will stress her out further. \\n\\nOur vet appointment for tomorrow is with a new vet. I’m hoping for answers but I’m emotionally scarred from this. I would consider rehoming or even giving her up to a rescue but I live in NYC and we are packed to the brim with shelter cats. I also don’t feel comfortable giving her up in this condition. \\n\\nMaybe I’m crazy but this seems like a genetic issue paired with possible kidney issues and I hate saying it but I can’t go on like this. Between my own health issues this environment isn’t conducive for either of us. I love her so dearly but again she’s in pain and so am I.

We have a vet appointment tomorrow but after nearly 24 hours of straight aggression I’m considering doing what I believe the humane thing would be. \\n\\nNow before anyone says anything please let me explain and I’m happy to receive constructive feedback.\\n\\nI’ve had my (4 year old) female cat since 6 weeks old. Ever since getting her she has been violent. I initially let some of her behavior slide as she was a kitten but clearly she never grew out of this behavior. By a year old she had attacked me 3-4 times if not more over peeing on my bed/random events. These weren’t just small scratches. She would explode, bushy tail big eyes, screaming and spitting. I took her to the vet multiple times only to be told this was behavioral. \\n\\nNow in the past 4 years I’ve been attacked more times than I can count. She’s tried attacking every roommate I’ve had, most people that come over and my other cat. I personally have been the only one mauled enough to the point of blood and scars. Never had to go to the ER but horrible enough that I’m physically scared on multiple parts of my body. \\n\\nAgain I’ve been to the vet after each incident. Never once receiving medication for the behavior. I was told she has crystals in her urine and that a wet food diet will fix this. I made the switch and didn’t see a change. \\n\\nLast night was probably one of the worst attacks in awhile. I take a lot of blame as our apartment has been extremely stressful for the past month. See my last post. \\n\\n24 hours later I let her out of my room and she’s still hissing and spitting at me. I’m scared to even get her into her crate to be seen by the vet. I have a TNR trap I’m going to use but probably will stress her out further. \\n\\nOur vet appointment for tomorrow is with a new vet. I’m hoping for answers but I’m emotionally scarred from this. I would consider rehoming or even giving her up to a rescue but I live in NYC and we are packed to the brim with shelter cats. I also don’t feel comfortable giving her up in this condition. \\n\\nMaybe I’m crazy but this seems like a genetic issue paired with possible kidney issues and I hate saying it but I can’t go on like this. Between my own health issues this environment isn’t conducive for either of us. I love her so dearly but again she’s in pain and so am I. ', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}]\n",

The next day he was still yelling sporadically when touched or approached. I told my partner to take him to the local vet who couldn’t localise any pain but thought it might be an acute arthritis flare up so he was given some carprofen. \\n\\nThat seemed to work wonders up until a week ago where he woke up in the middle of the night screaming in pain, it was very loud and very distressing. I thought perhaps he might be constipated as he was looking hunched over and like he wanted to go outside but nothing happened. Strangely he was ok with being picked up and fed treats during this time. I took him to the vet and they gave us some trazodone and gabapentin on top of his carprofen and suggested a CT to investigate any spinal problems, and he seemed ok after, however yesterday morning he had another episode in the middle of the night. I was on placement at a hospital with an emergency department so I took him with me to be monitored there for the day. The vet there also thought it was an acute arthritis flare up and said she could give him a buprenorphine injection to see if that helped. I honestly couldn’t tell because he was so zonked out after. That night he was crying again, it almost seemed as if he was distressed from being so disoriented while recovering from the bupe.\\n\\nSince then he has been ok and we have continued on the carprofen/traz/gaba but he’s still not quite himself.\\n\\nMy question is whether or not this could be something neurological ie CCD or brain tumour? He has definitely been acting more senile and these always seem to happen at night like some sort of sundowner syndrome. Another question of mine is whether it could be some sort of PTSD - one night after we first got him my boyfriend’s dog inexplicably decided to move to my dog’s bed in the middle of the night and it gave them both a fright and they had a go at each other. My dog was behaving very similar to now and was shaken up but recovered fine and that was over a year ago. He does seem to be more settled when sleeping in the living room.\\n\\nVery interested to hear any vet’s thoughts as I am completely stumped and just want my little man back to his cheery self again ☹️\\n\\nThanks for reading!', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/xpso8s/at_a_loss_about_whats_happening_with_my_senior/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 4, 'content': \"Doglang: An Artificial Language for Dog Commands\\nHi everyone! I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': \"Dementia food (Bright Mind) for dog with recurring pancreatitis\\n \\n\\n* **Species: Dog**\\n* **Age: 13**\\n* **Sex/Neuter status: Neutered**\\n* **Breed: Dachshund**\\n* **Body weight: 13 lbs**\\n* **History: Pancreatitis**\\n* **Clinical signs:** \\n* **Duration: 3 months**\\n* **Your general location: Dallas, TX**\\n* **Links to test results, vet reports, X-rays etc.**  \\n\\n\\nHi all - appreciate any advice on this.  \\n\\n\\nA few months ago our dog had a pretty bad bout of pancreatitis, had to stay overnight at an emergency vet and was in bad shape. They told us that the likelihood of recurrence was pretty high and we needed to monitor her diet closely.   \\n\\n\\nShe had another pancreatitis scare a few weeks ago, it wasn't nearly as bad as the first one though. She did test positive but didn't need to be hospitalized and it was managed by putting her on prescription GI food and gabapentin for awhile.   \\n\\n\\nHowever during this last session of vet visits for the pancreatitis, we also realized that she is experiencing signs of doggy dementia. On a day when our vet wasn't available her symptoms were really scaring us (pacing, barking at the walls, etc) and we took her to an emergency vet. They recommended we put her on a food like Bright Mind, but recommended that we call Purina to speak with a nutritionist to ask if Bright Mind is okay for a dog at high risk for pancreatitis. The nutritionist said they wouldn't give us any recommendations unless we had the vet on the line as well. The issue is our vet got really snarky about the recommendations from the emergency vet when we mentioned them to her, and we're not sure which vet to trust because the ER vet seemed very competent.   \\n\\n\\nSo what I'd really like opinions on is whether it's safe to switch our dog to Bright Mind. She is currently still on prescription GI food while we're trying to figure this out, previously she was on Canidae Senior dry kibble.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/z2dycv/dementia_food_bright_mind_for_dog_with_recurring/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 8, 'content': 'Cost concerns, two dogs needing procedures, not sure what to do, need advice please. \\nI’m in a bit of a predicament between my two dogs. Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics. I am having difficulty differentiating between panting due to anxiety and panting due to breathing issues.\\n\\nThanks so much if you made it this far, and TIA for advice/recommendations!!', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13hp4gc/dog_with_dementiaanxiety/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life.

However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 7, 'content': \"Suggestions for large breed Sundowners/Anxiety\\nOur 11 year old 85-90lb wonderful girl has undergone a massive shift in a weeks time.

I am trying to compress a long story as much as possible:\\n\\nWe have a female mixed breed rescue dog, weighing just about 10kg (22lbs). She is neutered and has been living with us for 4.5 years now. Up until now we had no behavioral issues and she integrated very well in our daily lives. The household consists of two adults, no kids, no other pets. No Medication or known issues.\\n\\nUnfortunately on 2nd January 2025 she had an accident were a heavy object fell on her paw and injured it. She suffered a small fracture on a toe and has an open wound between two toes. We immediately went to a veterinary clinic. There she was x-rayed and examined. The fracture was seen as a minor issue that should heal on its own (this was later confirmed by an orthopedic surgeon), the cut was the more severe problem. The wound was cleaned and the foot was bandaged, no stitches were applied. The bandages were changed daily. She used the foot normally after that, no change in behavior was seen by us, we did only very short walks (about 3x 10 minutes/day).\\n\\nA week later the wound was examined again under sedation since she showed new signs of pain and was then stitched up. Pain medication was increased.\\n\\nThe (multiple) vets we saw say that the foot slowly needs to come out of the bandage for the wound to heal properly. Unfortunately amy starts to manically lick the paw as soon as she has any access to it. Muzzles or cones did not help (she is trained on both) and she reacts with unseen aggression to any attempt to stop her from licking. She growls loudly and snaps at my hands if i come close to the paw when she is licking it. Only getting her bandaged again at the vet stopped that behaviour.\\n\\nWe are now desperately looking for any insights or experience on how to keep a dog from licking the paw after it, this is our guess, now seems like a foreign object since it changed in smell and feel under the bandage. Especially when cones or muzzles are no option because she fights them violently.\\n\\nAll of this happened under close supervision of multiple vets, we are very certain that there are no other issues with the paw other then the aforementioned.\\n\\nThanks for any insights or ideas.

The next day he was still yelling sporadically when touched or approached. I told my partner to take him to the local vet who couldn’t localise any pain but thought it might be an acute arthritis flare up so he was given some carprofen. \\n\\nThat seemed to work wonders up until a week ago where he woke up in the middle of the night screaming in pain, it was very loud and very distressing. I thought perhaps he might be constipated as he was looking hunched over and like he wanted to go outside but nothing happened. Strangely he was ok with being picked up and fed treats during this time. I took him to the vet and they gave us some trazodone and gabapentin on top of his carprofen and suggested a CT to investigate any spinal problems, and he seemed ok after, however yesterday morning he had another episode in the middle of the night. I was on placement at a hospital with an emergency department so I took him with me to be monitored there for the day. The vet there also thought it was an acute arthritis flare up and said she could give him a buprenorphine injection to see if that helped. I honestly couldn’t tell because he was so zonked out after. That night he was crying again, it almost seemed as if he was distressed from being so disoriented while recovering from the bupe.\\n\\nSince then he has been ok and we have continued on the carprofen/traz/gaba but he’s still not quite himself.\\n\\nMy question is whether or not this could be something neurological ie CCD or brain tumour? He has definitely been acting more senile and these always seem to happen at night like some sort of sundowner syndrome. Another question of mine is whether it could be some sort of PTSD - one night after we first got him my boyfriend’s dog inexplicably decided to move to my dog’s bed in the middle of the night and it gave them both a fright and they had a go at each other. My dog was behaving very similar to now and was shaken up but recovered fine and that was over a year ago. He does seem to be more settled when sleeping in the living room.\\n\\nVery interested to hear any vet’s thoughts as I am completely stumped and just want my little man back to his cheery self again ☹️\\n\\nThanks for reading!', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/xpso8s/at_a_loss_about_whats_happening_with_my_senior/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 4, 'content': \"Doglang: An Artificial Language for Dog Commands\\nHi everyone! I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands.

They told us that the likelihood of recurrence was pretty high and we needed to monitor her diet closely.   \\n\\n\\nShe had another pancreatitis scare a few weeks ago, it wasn't nearly as bad as the first one though. She did test positive but didn't need to be hospitalized and it was managed by putting her on prescription GI food and gabapentin for awhile.   \\n\\n\\nHowever during this last session of vet visits for the pancreatitis, we also realized that she is experiencing signs of doggy dementia. On a day when our vet wasn't available her symptoms were really scaring us (pacing, barking at the walls, etc) and we took her to an emergency vet. They recommended we put her on a food like Bright Mind, but recommended that we call Purina to speak with a nutritionist to ask if Bright Mind is okay for a dog at high risk for pancreatitis. The nutritionist said they wouldn't give us any recommendations unless we had the vet on the line as well. The issue is our vet got really snarky about the recommendations from the emergency vet when we mentioned them to her, and we're not sure which vet to trust because the ER vet seemed very competent.   \\n\\n\\nSo what I'd really like opinions on is whether it's safe to switch our dog to Bright Mind. She is currently still on prescription GI food while we're trying to figure this out, previously she was on Canidae Senior dry kibble.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/z2dycv/dementia_food_bright_mind_for_dog_with_recurring/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 8, 'content': 'Cost concerns, two dogs needing procedures, not sure what to do, need advice please. \\nI’m in a bit of a predicament between my two dogs. Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness.

See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life.

Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 7, 'content': \"Suggestions for large breed Sundowners/Anxiety\\nOur 11 year old 85-90lb wonderful girl has undergone a massive shift in a weeks time.

I am trying to compress a long story as much as possible:\\n\\nWe have a female mixed breed rescue dog, weighing just about 10kg (22lbs). She is neutered and has been living with us for 4.5 years now. Up until now we had no behavioral issues and she integrated very well in our daily lives. The household consists of two adults, no kids, no other pets. No Medication or known issues.\\n\\nUnfortunately on 2nd January 2025 she had an accident were a heavy object fell on her paw and injured it. She suffered a small fracture on a toe and has an open wound between two toes. We immediately went to a veterinary clinic. There she was x-rayed and examined. The fracture was seen as a minor issue that should heal on its own (this was later confirmed by an orthopedic surgeon), the cut was the more severe problem. The wound was cleaned and the foot was bandaged, no stitches were applied. The bandages were changed daily. She used the foot normally after that, no change in behavior was seen by us, we did only very short walks (about 3x 10 minutes/day).\\n\\nA week later the wound was examined again under sedation since she showed new signs of pain and was then stitched up. Pain medication was increased.\\n\\nThe (multiple) vets we saw say that the foot slowly needs to come out of the bandage for the wound to heal properly. Unfortunately amy starts to manically lick the paw as soon as she has any access to it. Muzzles or cones did not help (she is trained on both) and she reacts with unseen aggression to any attempt to stop her from licking. She growls loudly and snaps at my hands if i come close to the paw when she is licking it. Only getting her bandaged again at the vet stopped that behaviour.\\n\\nWe are now desperately looking for any insights or experience on how to keep a dog from licking the paw after it, this is our guess, now seems like a foreign object since it changed in smell and feel under the bandage. Especially when cones or muzzles are no option because she fights them violently.\\n\\nAll of this happened under close supervision of multiple vets, we are very certain that there are no other issues with the paw other then the aforementioned.\\n\\nThanks for any insights or ideas.

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to\\nproduce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.\\n\\nAnxitane\\n-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.\\n-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.\\n\\nValerian Root:\\n-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.\\n-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room.

I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 8, 'content': 'Cost concerns, two dogs needing procedures, not sure what to do, need advice please. \\nI’m in a bit of a predicament between my two dogs. Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

Gus has suddenly developed severe separation anxiety and goes CRAZY when I leave the house--loudly vocalizing, pacing, panting, trying to escape the gated-in kitchen area. It just started about a month ago, and has gotten to such a level that I feel like I can never leave my house. I teach, so my schedule is very laid-back in the summer and more rigorous when school starts (about now). So I HAVE to find some answers. Some quick background on Gus's medical condition:\\n\\n--he has arthritis and was on anti-inflammatories (Metacam, then Deramax) and had back GI issues that led to irritable bowel. He's now off the meds, but to help with the IBS, I also transitioned him from a duck and sweet potato food to a duck grain free food. It's high protein and I'd say he's been on it for a few months. I read that high protein can sometimes cause anxiety. Is this true?\\n\\n--because he can't take NSAIDs for arthritis, he's on 25mg 2x/day of Tramadol for pain. I've read that sometimes Tramadol can negatively effect a dog with canine cognitive disorder, which his litter mate did develop. (the other dog is now on a variety of supplements, which has almost taken the symptoms away). Could a similar thing be happening to Gus? Other meds Gus takes: --Carafate (once at night for GI coating) --1/2 Pepcid with meals (to settle IBS stomach) --25 mgs of Tramadol 2x/day --3mg melatonin (which I thought would help calm him but hasn't)\\n\\nXanax (which I tried, b/c my other dog had it and they're the same age/breed/weight, etc) only made him MORE hyper, but maybe because he was already amped up when I gave it to him. I also tried a Thundershirt (with the suggested gradual training) and it only made his cry a bit quieter. Not really helpful and not something I feel comfortable leaving him in for 6-7 hours.\\n\\nAnd Gus does appear anxious at other times, too, though the anxiety is worst when I leave. But even when I'm making dinner or cleaning (anytime I'm not sitting next to him) he'll stand and cry. After a while he will go lie down, but it takes a while. He cries in the car too, and anytime something happens he doesn't expect. He does get exercise every day--several shorter walks because of his arthritis.\\n\\nSo what can I do!? Medications? I tried behavioral work, but feel like I need something else to go along with those modifications. Should I change foods? Supplements that work? I'm afraid he's going to harm himself or have a heart attack because he's SO anxious and stressed for hours when I'm gone.

Recently she awoke from deep sleep panting heavily while in a cool room and did not stop for atleast 20 minutes, then proceeded to obsessively lick her paws for over an hour.\\nDuration: the unexplained whining, licking, and general anxiety began about 18 months ago and has progressively become more severe.

I am concerned about and seeking a second opinion on several concerns, and would appreciate any advice to promote superior care and comfort for my dog.\\n\\nOver this past year, Bella Jane’s dementia and resulting symptoms have progressively worsened. The vet prescribed trazadone to help her feel more calm and relaxed during anxious times, especially during the evenings. Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics. I am having difficulty differentiating between panting due to anxiety and panting due to breathing issues.\\n\\nThanks so much if you made it this far, and TIA for advice/recommendations!!', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13hp4gc/dog_with_dementiaanxiety/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 7, 'content': 'At a loss about what’s happening with my senior dog despite being a final year vet student\\nHello, I’m looking for insight into what might be the best approach to my senior dog as it seems to be a complicated case and all the vets at my uni have had vastly different opinions!\\n\\n- Roughly 13yo (he was a stray so mystery background) MN Pomeranian x\\n- Rescued him around 2.5 years ago\\n- Only previous history I have from the rescue org is that his left eye was removed due to what was thought to be a deep ulcer that had become completely keratinised and he was blind in that eye, plus some spondylosis and narrowed disc space in his lumbar region\\n- Recent bloods and urinalysis from this week and one year ago were unremarkable\\n\\nThe problem:\\nA few weeks ago I was away on rural placement for a week and my partner said our dog woke up in the middle of the night yelping before managing to settle again. The next day he was still yelling sporadically when touched or approached. I told my partner to take him to the local vet who couldn’t localise any pain but thought it might be an acute arthritis flare up so he was given some carprofen. \\n\\nThat seemed to work wonders up until a week ago where he woke up in the middle of the night screaming in pain, it was very loud and very distressing. I thought perhaps he might be constipated as he was looking hunched over and like he wanted to go outside but nothing happened. Strangely he was ok with being picked up and fed treats during this time. I took him to the vet and they gave us some trazodone and gabapentin on top of his carprofen and suggested a CT to investigate any spinal problems, and he seemed ok after, however yesterday morning he had another episode in the middle of the night. I was on placement at a hospital with an emergency department so I took him with me to be monitored there for the day. The vet there also thought it was an acute arthritis flare up and said she could give him a buprenorphine injection to see if that helped. I honestly couldn’t tell because he was so zonked out after. That night he was crying again, it almost seemed as if he was distressed from being so disoriented while recovering from the bupe.\\n\\nSince then he has been ok and we have continued on the carprofen/traz/gaba but he’s still not quite himself.\\n\\nMy question is whether or not this could be something neurological ie CCD or brain tumour? He has definitely been acting more senile and these always seem to happen at night like some sort of sundowner syndrome. Another question of mine is whether it could be some sort of PTSD - one night after we first got him my boyfriend’s dog inexplicably decided to move to my dog’s bed in the middle of the night and it gave them both a fright and they had a go at each other. My dog was behaving very similar to now and was shaken up but recovered fine and that was over a year ago. He does seem to be more settled when sleeping in the living room.\\n\\nVery interested to hear any vet’s thoughts as I am completely stumped and just want my little man back to his cheery self again ☹️\\n\\nThanks for reading!', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/xpso8s/at_a_loss_about_whats_happening_with_my_senior/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}], 'link': ['https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/3nb8nu/curious_do_you_use_aromatherapy_on_your_dog/', 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1cd5lak/13_year_old_extra_large_breed_dog_having_good/', 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/pxgjr0/spike_two_year_old_staffy_who_is_very_active_and/', 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hxuh07/cost_concerns_two_dogs_needing_procedures_not/', 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/2e5cmd/help_for_senior_jack_russell_with_sudden/', 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13hp4gc/dog_with_dementiaanxiety/', 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/xpso8s/at_a_loss_about_whats_happening_with_my_senior/'], 'content': [], 'documents': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]}, 'professional': {'metadata': [], 'content': [], 'documents': []}, 'images': {'metadata': [], 'paths': [], 'relevance': []}}\n",

(Apologies for crappy formatting in the list -- I\\'m copy/pasting it from a PDF.)\\n\\nDoes anyone have experience with any of them? Do you recommend any of them, in addition to the usual clicker training/positive reinforcement/lots of exercise? I\\'m particularly curious about the DAP collar, Chillout spray, and Bach Flower Essences.\\n\\nLIST:\\n\\nD.A.P. Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to\\nproduce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.\\n\\nAnxitane\\n-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.\\n-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.\\n\\nValerian Root:\\n-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.\\n-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals. Its central nervous system effects are thought to be associated with an action on the\\ninhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

Despite receiving treatment for arthritis, tie back surgery for laryngeal paralysis/GOLPP, canine cognitive dysfunction, removal of a malignant tumour on his lip, and other ailments, he’s been struggling more recently.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life.

We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 4, 'content': \"Doglang: An Artificial Language for Dog Commands\\nHi everyone! I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 8, 'content': 'Cost concerns, two dogs needing procedures, not sure what to do, need advice please. \\nI’m in a bit of a predicament between my two dogs. Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

Gus has suddenly developed severe separation anxiety and goes CRAZY when I leave the house--loudly vocalizing, pacing, panting, trying to escape the gated-in kitchen area. It just started about a month ago, and has gotten to such a level that I feel like I can never leave my house. I teach, so my schedule is very laid-back in the summer and more rigorous when school starts (about now). So I HAVE to find some answers. Some quick background on Gus's medical condition:\\n\\n--he has arthritis and was on anti-inflammatories (Metacam, then Deramax) and had back GI issues that led to irritable bowel. He's now off the meds, but to help with the IBS, I also transitioned him from a duck and sweet potato food to a duck grain free food. It's high protein and I'd say he's been on it for a few months. I read that high protein can sometimes cause anxiety. Is this true?\\n\\n--because he can't take NSAIDs for arthritis, he's on 25mg 2x/day of Tramadol for pain. I've read that sometimes Tramadol can negatively effect a dog with canine cognitive disorder, which his litter mate did develop. (the other dog is now on a variety of supplements, which has almost taken the symptoms away). Could a similar thing be happening to Gus? Other meds Gus takes: --Carafate (once at night for GI coating) --1/2 Pepcid with meals (to settle IBS stomach) --25 mgs of Tramadol 2x/day --3mg melatonin (which I thought would help calm him but hasn't)\\n\\nXanax (which I tried, b/c my other dog had it and they're the same age/breed/weight, etc) only made him MORE hyper, but maybe because he was already amped up when I gave it to him. I also tried a Thundershirt (with the suggested gradual training) and it only made his cry a bit quieter. Not really helpful and not something I feel comfortable leaving him in for 6-7 hours.\\n\\nAnd Gus does appear anxious at other times, too, though the anxiety is worst when I leave. But even when I'm making dinner or cleaning (anytime I'm not sitting next to him) he'll stand and cry. After a while he will go lie down, but it takes a while. He cries in the car too, and anytime something happens he doesn't expect. He does get exercise every day--several shorter walks because of his arthritis.\\n\\nSo what can I do!? Medications? I tried behavioral work, but feel like I need something else to go along with those modifications. Should I change foods? Supplements that work? I'm afraid he's going to harm himself or have a heart attack because he's SO anxious and stressed for hours when I'm gone. Plus I feel trapped.\\n\\nThanks in advance for help!\\n\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/2e5cmd/help_for_senior_jack_russell_with_sudden/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 2, 'content': 'Dog with dementia/anxiety\\nHello vets!\\n\\nSpecies: dog\\nAge: 11 years 7 months\\nSex/neuter status: female/spayed\\nBreed: blue nose pit bull\\nBody weight: 69 lbs.\\nHistory: 3 mast cell tumor removals.

The vet prescribed trazadone to help her feel more calm and relaxed during anxious times, especially during the evenings. Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics.

The next day he was still yelling sporadically when touched or approached. I told my partner to take him to the local vet who couldn’t localise any pain but thought it might be an acute arthritis flare up so he was given some carprofen. \\n\\nThat seemed to work wonders up until a week ago where he woke up in the middle of the night screaming in pain, it was very loud and very distressing. I thought perhaps he might be constipated as he was looking hunched over and like he wanted to go outside but nothing happened. Strangely he was ok with being picked up and fed treats during this time. I took him to the vet and they gave us some trazodone and gabapentin on top of his carprofen and suggested a CT to investigate any spinal problems, and he seemed ok after, however yesterday morning he had another episode in the middle of the night. I was on placement at a hospital with an emergency department so I took him with me to be monitored there for the day. The vet there also thought it was an acute arthritis flare up and said she could give him a buprenorphine injection to see if that helped. I honestly couldn’t tell because he was so zonked out after. That night he was crying again, it almost seemed as if he was distressed from being so disoriented while recovering from the bupe.\\n\\nSince then he has been ok and we have continued on the carprofen/traz/gaba but he’s still not quite himself.\\n\\nMy question is whether or not this could be something neurological ie CCD or brain tumour?

I read that high protein can sometimes cause anxiety. Is this true?\\n\\n--because he can't take NSAIDs for arthritis, he's on 25mg 2x/day of Tramadol for pain. I've read that sometimes Tramadol can negatively effect a dog with canine cognitive disorder, which his litter mate did develop. (the other dog is now on a variety of supplements, which has almost taken the symptoms away). Could a similar thing be happening to Gus? Other meds Gus takes: --Carafate (once at night for GI coating) --1/2 Pepcid with meals (to settle IBS stomach) --25 mgs of Tramadol 2x/day --3mg melatonin (which I thought would help calm him but hasn't)\\n\\nXanax (which I tried, b/c my other dog had it and they're the same age/breed/weight, etc) only made him MORE hyper, but maybe because he was already amped up when I gave it to him. I also tried a Thundershirt (with the suggested gradual training) and it only made his cry a bit quieter. Not really helpful and not something I feel comfortable leaving him in for 6-7 hours.\\n\\nAnd Gus does appear anxious at other times, too, though the anxiety is worst when I leave. But even when I'm making dinner or cleaning (anytime I'm not sitting next to him) he'll stand and cry. After a while he will go lie down, but it takes a while. He cries in the car too, and anytime something happens he doesn't expect. He does get exercise every day--several shorter walks because of his arthritis.\\n\\nSo what can I do!? Medications? I tried behavioral work, but feel like I need something else to go along with those modifications. Should I change foods? Supplements that work? I'm afraid he's going to harm himself or have a heart attack because he's SO anxious and stressed for hours when I'm gone. Plus I feel trapped.\\n\\nThanks in advance for help!\\n\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/2e5cmd/help_for_senior_jack_russell_with_sudden/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': \"Senior Dog- Anxiety? \\nHi! \\n\\nI have an 11 year old rescue dog who I love more than my life. ❤️ Over the past 6 months, I've noticed her acting stiff and sore after our hikes.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain.

After months of hesitation I gathered my courage and finally took my beloved 16 yo dog to an MRI scan.

However, the MRI diagnozed her with cognitive disfuction, for which obviously there is no treatment.\\n\\nNow, this diagnosis in itself doesn't come as a shocker given her age. However, the real shocker was the vet saying that this CCD is the main cause of her paralysis, and that there is no need for further investigation about a potential IVDD. After a few hours of grieving (all these months I’d had a glimmer of hope deep inside that her paralysis is treatable), I’ve now decided to do some research on my own about CCD, and, to my surprise, CCD is nowhere given as a potential cause for paralysis.\\n\\nI would like to have some more opinions here on this topic, because I want to fight for my dog till the end. Her quality of life is otherwise good: her blood work looks good, she eats eats normally, she drinks normally, she urinates/defecates normally, no vision loss, no hearing loss. She does sometimes get restless (and I can totally trace this to her dementia), but overall the only big issue is her paralysis. Should I accept that dementia lead to her paralysis and there is no coming back? Or should I request an opinion from another vet?

Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

The next day he was still yelling sporadically when touched or approached. I told my partner to take him to the local vet who couldn’t localise any pain but thought it might be an acute arthritis flare up so he was given some carprofen. \\n\\nThat seemed to work wonders up until a week ago where he woke up in the middle of the night screaming in pain, it was very loud and very distressing. I thought perhaps he might be constipated as he was looking hunched over and like he wanted to go outside but nothing happened. Strangely he was ok with being picked up and fed treats during this time. I took him to the vet and they gave us some trazodone and gabapentin on top of his carprofen and suggested a CT to investigate any spinal problems, and he seemed ok after, however yesterday morning he had another episode in the middle of the night. I was on placement at a hospital with an emergency department so I took him with me to be monitored there for the day. The vet there also thought it was an acute arthritis flare up and said she could give him a buprenorphine injection to see if that helped. I honestly couldn’t tell because he was so zonked out after. That night he was crying again, it almost seemed as if he was distressed from being so disoriented while recovering from the bupe.\\n\\nSince then he has been ok and we have continued on the carprofen/traz/gaba but he’s still not quite himself.\\n\\nMy question is whether or not this could be something neurological ie CCD or brain tumour? He has definitely been acting more senile and these always seem to happen at night like some sort of sundowner syndrome. Another question of mine is whether it could be some sort of PTSD - one night after we first got him my boyfriend’s dog inexplicably decided to move to my dog’s bed in the middle of the night and it gave them both a fright and they had a go at each other. My dog was behaving very similar to now and was shaken up but recovered fine and that was over a year ago.

Gus has suddenly developed severe separation anxiety and goes CRAZY when I leave the house--loudly vocalizing, pacing, panting, trying to escape the gated-in kitchen area. It just started about a month ago, and has gotten to such a level that I feel like I can never leave my house. I teach, so my schedule is very laid-back in the summer and more rigorous when school starts (about now). So I HAVE to find some answers. Some quick background on Gus's medical condition:\\n\\n--he has arthritis and was on anti-inflammatories (Metacam, then Deramax) and had back GI issues that led to irritable bowel. He's now off the meds, but to help with the IBS, I also transitioned him from a duck and sweet potato food to a duck grain free food. It's high protein and I'd say he's been on it for a few months. I read that high protein can sometimes cause anxiety. Is this true?\\n\\n--because he can't take NSAIDs for arthritis, he's on 25mg 2x/day of Tramadol for pain. I've read that sometimes Tramadol can negatively effect a dog with canine cognitive disorder, which his litter mate did develop. (the other dog is now on a variety of supplements, which has almost taken the symptoms away). Could a similar thing be happening to Gus? Other meds Gus takes: --Carafate (once at night for GI coating) --1/2 Pepcid with meals (to settle IBS stomach) --25 mgs of Tramadol 2x/day --3mg melatonin (which I thought would help calm him but hasn't)\\n\\nXanax (which I tried, b/c my other dog had it and they're the same age/breed/weight, etc) only made him MORE hyper, but maybe because he was already amped up when I gave it to him. I also tried a Thundershirt (with the suggested gradual training) and it only made his cry a bit quieter. Not really helpful and not something I feel comfortable leaving him in for 6-7 hours.\\n\\nAnd Gus does appear anxious at other times, too, though the anxiety is worst when I leave. But even when I'm making dinner or cleaning (anytime I'm not sitting next to him) he'll stand and cry. After a while he will go lie down, but it takes a while. He cries in the car too, and anytime something happens he doesn't expect. He does get exercise every day--several shorter walks because of his arthritis.\\n\\nSo what can I do!? Medications? I tried behavioral work, but feel like I need something else to go along with those modifications. Should I change foods? Supplements that work? I'm afraid he's going to harm himself or have a heart attack because he's SO anxious and stressed for hours when I'm gone. Plus I feel trapped.\\n\\nThanks in advance for help!\\n\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/2e5cmd/help_for_senior_jack_russell_with_sudden/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': \"Senior Dog- Anxiety? \\nHi! \\n\\nI have an 11 year old rescue dog who I love more than my life. ❤️ Over the past 6 months, I've noticed her acting stiff and sore after our hikes.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life.

After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': \"16 yo dog with CCD\\nHello! After months of hesitation I gathered my courage and finally took my beloved 16 yo dog to an MRI scan.

However, the MRI diagnozed her with cognitive disfuction, for which obviously there is no treatment.\\n\\nNow, this diagnosis in itself doesn't come as a shocker given her age. However, the real shocker was the vet saying that this CCD is the main cause of her paralysis, and that there is no need for further investigation about a potential IVDD.

Her quality of life is otherwise good: her blood work looks good, she eats eats normally, she drinks normally, she urinates/defecates normally, no vision loss, no hearing loss. She does sometimes get restless (and I can totally trace this to her dementia), but overall the only big issue is her paralysis.

Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

The next day he was still yelling sporadically when touched or approached. I told my partner to take him to the local vet who couldn’t localise any pain but thought it might be an acute arthritis flare up so he was given some carprofen. \\n\\nThat seemed to work wonders up until a week ago where he woke up in the middle of the night screaming in pain, it was very loud and very distressing. I thought perhaps he might be constipated as he was looking hunched over and like he wanted to go outside but nothing happened. Strangely he was ok with being picked up and fed treats during this time. I took him to the vet and they gave us some trazodone and gabapentin on top of his carprofen and suggested a CT to investigate any spinal problems, and he seemed ok after, however yesterday morning he had another episode in the middle of the night. I was on placement at a hospital with an emergency department so I took him with me to be monitored there for the day. The vet there also thought it was an acute arthritis flare up and said she could give him a buprenorphine injection to see if that helped. I honestly couldn’t tell because he was so zonked out after. That night he was crying again, it almost seemed as if he was distressed from being so disoriented while recovering from the bupe.\\n\\nSince then he has been ok and we have continued on the carprofen/traz/gaba but he’s still not quite himself.\\n\\nMy question is whether or not this could be something neurological ie CCD or brain tumour?

Another question of mine is whether it could be some sort of PTSD - one night after we first got him my boyfriend’s dog inexplicably decided to move to my dog’s bed in the middle of the night and it gave them both a fright and they had a go at each other. My dog was behaving very similar to now and was shaken up but recovered fine and that was over a year ago.

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states.

I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 7, 'content': 'From one pet parent to another, I’m sorry that you’re going through this now.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness.

See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact.

Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 8, 'content': 'Cost concerns, two dogs needing procedures, not sure what to do, need advice please. \\nI’m in a bit of a predicament between my two dogs. Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

The routine labs always came back with “slightly high liver” which never concerned the two vets I was seeing before we moved in 2021. We’ve been going to a different vet since 2021 when we relocated across the US. \\n\\nApril 2024: routine annual exam, labs were all normal and I agreed to several vaccines reluctantly, aside from the mandatory rabies vaccine. \\n\\nI Increased CBD dosage to about 34mg/2x day because I thought she would benefit as she was getting slower I think. I can’t remember but I had a good reason for it. \\n\\nAugust 2024: noticed a hanging growth under her tongue (video above). Went to our vet on 8/5 who recommended surgery to remove it in case it’s a malignant tumor that’s missing pigment, I forgot the medical term. We stopped all supplements including the CBD in preparation for the surgery. \\n\\n8/7/2024 night: She threw up her breakfast a couple of hours after giving a piece of banana. We didn’t fast her since it was 12 hours since eating breakfast and gave her dinner not long after. After dinner, she got 1/2 of an Oravet dental chew but seemingly chewed in two halves before swallowing. \\n\\nShe threw up several more times into the following morning which included her undigested meal and both halves of the Oravet chew. We fasted her for 16 hours occasionally giving only coconut water (no sugar added)  until we finally decided to feed her due to her lethargy. Fed a little pureed boiled chicken breast and white rice every few hours. We noticed she had a fever that crept up to 104.7 overnight Friday 8/9 into Saturday so we applied a cold compress to her feet and ears, while she wore her cooling vest. We brought the fever down to 103.5 during the night and 102.4 right before going to the vet. \\n\\nWhen we went to the vet the following morning (Saturday 8/10), we told the vet everything including the fact that she was now eating. He recommended postponing the surgery. We requested labs that showed ALT 16x higher than in April and slightly low WBC. Pictures of the last two sets of labs above - April labs were sent out, and August labs were done in-house. She also lost two lbs since April because of the vomiting?\\n\\nThe vet prescribed Enrofloxacin 204mg flex tabs  - 1/2 tablet twice daily for ten days and a supplement for her liver called Denamarin 225 mg S-Adenosylmethionine* and 82 mg Silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (SPC)' (SAMe) two tablets daily on an empty stomach one-hour minimum before food. \\n\\nHer temperature was 102.6 at the the vet and it's now 101.6 after two doses of antibiotics. She is showing signs of improvement when she’s awake however she is still tired and is sleeping a lot today, only a little more than she usually does. I can see her face is still tired. \\n\\nAlso, it’s probably worth mentioning that she had an emergency stomach exploratory surgery two years ago because she ate a sanitary pad. She recovered well and she has not eaten anything foreign since then. \\n\\n\\nMy wife suggested we don’t do the surgery at all since it’s taking her quite some time to bounce back and we don’t know how the anesthesia will affect her considering her age.  We believe he cares about his patients even though he doesn’t seem to absorb all the details we tell him until we reiterate it. We just want additional opinion(s) on the overall situation including the kidney and surgery. \\n\\nThank you for your time. \\n\\nLink to video showing tongue, pics of labwork, pics of medication and pics of supplements \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/VYLdEHg\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1eq1x3q/second_opinion_request/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': 'Mystery Condition, 13.5 year old Male Norwegian Elkhound Mix\\nHello,\\n\\n**We are looking for anyone’s help to generate potential ideas/diagnoses/illnesses we should consider for our dog.

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to\\nproduce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.\\n\\nAnxitane\\n-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.\\n-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.\\n\\nValerian Root:\\n-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.\\n-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals. Its central nervous system effects are thought to be associated with an action on the\\ninhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 7, 'content': 'From one pet parent to another, I’m sorry that you’re going through this now.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness.

It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

Spayed “Shepherd Terrier” mix\\nLocation: Central Florida, USA\\n\\nActivity: 0.84-mile slow walk 5-6 days a week before the sun comes up, then walks around the house for an hour before breakfast, then sleeps all day getting up a few times here and there, then gets up and walks around for an hour before dinner, walks around after dinner, plays, then bed. She was diagnosed as having “canine Alzheimers” since she is constantly getting stuck in corners and tight spaces. \\n\\nFood: BJs Premium and Supreme Raw blend complete meal for two years until 7/2024 (she got tired of eating it) when we switched to FreshPet cooked chicken complete meal with raw sardines. \\n\\nSupplements: soil-based probiotics, rejensa joint chews (modified glucosamine, from the vet), Dr. Bill’s Canine Cognitive Support, kelp (150mcg iodine per day), and turmeric golden paste\\n\\nMedications: Heartgard plus heartworm preventive\\n\\nI have been giving her CBD from good companies with 3rd party testing since ~2016. 2016-2022 was CBD isolate and the last two years have been giving broad spectrum CBD. The routine labs always came back with “slightly high liver” which never concerned the two vets I was seeing before we moved in 2021. We’ve been going to a different vet since 2021 when we relocated across the US. \\n\\nApril 2024: routine annual exam, labs were all normal and I agreed to several vaccines reluctantly, aside from the mandatory rabies vaccine. \\n\\nI Increased CBD dosage to about 34mg/2x day because I thought she would benefit as she was getting slower I think. I can’t remember but I had a good reason for it. \\n\\nAugust 2024: noticed a hanging growth under her tongue (video above). Went to our vet on 8/5 who recommended surgery to remove it in case it’s a malignant tumor that’s missing pigment, I forgot the medical term. We stopped all supplements including the CBD in preparation for the surgery. \\n\\n8/7/2024 night: She threw up her breakfast a couple of hours after giving a piece of banana. We didn’t fast her since it was 12 hours since eating breakfast and gave her dinner not long after. After dinner, she got 1/2 of an Oravet dental chew but seemingly chewed in two halves before swallowing. \\n\\nShe threw up several more times into the following morning which included her undigested meal and both halves of the Oravet chew. We fasted her for 16 hours occasionally giving only coconut water (no sugar added)  until we finally decided to feed her due to her lethargy. Fed a little pureed boiled chicken breast and white rice every few hours. We noticed she had a fever that crept up to 104.7 overnight Friday 8/9 into Saturday so we applied a cold compress to her feet and ears, while she wore her cooling vest. We brought the fever down to 103.5 during the night and 102.4 right before going to the vet. \\n\\nWhen we went to the vet the following morning (Saturday 8/10), we told the vet everything including the fact that she was now eating. He recommended postponing the surgery. We requested labs that showed ALT 16x higher than in April and slightly low WBC. Pictures of the last two sets of labs above - April labs were sent out, and August labs were done in-house. She also lost two lbs since April because of the vomiting?\\n\\nThe vet prescribed Enrofloxacin 204mg flex tabs  - 1/2 tablet twice daily for ten days and a supplement for her liver called Denamarin 225 mg S-Adenosylmethionine* and 82 mg Silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (SPC)' (SAMe) two tablets daily on an empty stomach one-hour minimum before food. \\n\\nHer temperature was 102.6 at the the vet and it's now 101.6 after two doses of antibiotics. She is showing signs of improvement when she’s awake however she is still tired and is sleeping a lot today, only a little more than she usually does. I can see her face is still tired. \\n\\nAlso, it’s probably worth mentioning that she had an emergency stomach exploratory surgery two years ago because she ate a sanitary pad. She recovered well and she has not eaten anything foreign since then. \\n\\n\\nMy wife suggested we don’t do the surgery at all since it’s taking her quite some time to bounce back and we don’t know how the anesthesia will affect her considering her age.  We believe he cares about his patients even though he doesn’t seem to absorb all the details we tell him until we reiterate it. We just want additional opinion(s) on the overall situation including the kidney and surgery. \\n\\nThank you for your time. \\n\\nLink to video showing tongue, pics of labwork, pics of medication and pics of supplements \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/VYLdEHg\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1eq1x3q/second_opinion_request/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': 'Mystery Condition, 13.5 year old Male Norwegian Elkhound Mix\\nHello,\\n\\n**We are looking for anyone’s help to generate potential ideas/diagnoses/illnesses we should consider for our dog.

If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**\\n\\n*No, I have owned a Cane Corso, American Pitbull Terrier and a GSD Mix. All of my dogs were trained in basic obedience (Sit, Stay, Down, Recall, loose lead walking)*\\n\\n**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**\\n\\n*I just lost my Cane Corse to Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and my APBT to bone cancer within a year of each other. They were 10 and 9, respectively. So, I'll be going the reputable breeder route to minimize any health issues moving forward.*\\n\\n**Describe your ideal dog.**\\n\\n*My dream dog is medium - X- Large, minimal-moderate shedding, easily trainable, happy on a hike or in the house for a movie night. They will accompany me almost everywhere, other than work.*\\n\\n**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**\\n\\n*My dream breed is a Dutch Shepherd, they are the most beautiful breed I've ever seen. Unfortunately, my research has built up some fear of not being able to sufficiently meet the breeds physical exercise requirements, (From my understanding, they are like Malinois level energizer bunnies that just go and go) and I've also read that they do not enjoy cuddling after a days work, which is something I absolutely need in a breed lol.*\\n\\n*This has led me to lean towards the GSD breed. I do not particularly like the look of the showline GSD, but their temperament and exercise requirements seem to be exactly what I need. I LOVE the look of the dark sable working line shepherds, with the more square structure and healthier hips / elbows, but I have the same hesitations that come with the Dutch Shepherds regarding the 23.5hrs a day of exercise required to make them happy lol.*\\n\\n*I also feel like the Doberman could be ideal for me, but their breed-specific health issues seem way too common. Kind of scares me, do NOT want another dog to get sick on me.*\\n\\n**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**\\n\\n*Advanced Obedience (Strict heel, down, stay, sit, place, recall, off-lead obedience for hikes), I will be putting a TON of time and energy into the socialization of my pup so he can go to lots of places with me and be comfortable and happy, and, potentially some bite and scent work training that could translate into IPO-style dog sports for fun.*\\n\\n**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**\\n\\n*This is a possibilty down the road when I think he's bored with our normal training routines. I have 0 experience in this field, however.*\\n\\nCare Commitments\\n\\n**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**\\n\\n*I will be doing about 30-60 mins of obedience training, 60-90mins of physcial play, 2-3 walks about 2 miles each, and as much socialization I can each day. At home, my family will be interacting with him nonstop (light play indoors, cuddling, etc.)*\\n\\n**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**\\n\\n*an hour - hour and a half of physical exercise is a realistic number I can hit daily (more on weekends as I go for hikes or walk through state parks on saturday mornings), I also calculate mental and physical exercise as separate activities, so we will also be doing another 30/60 mins of mental exercise via obedience training and puzzles. This includes walks around the neghborhood, playing in our fenced backyard, going to any of the local parks, hiking, etc.*\\n\\n*I will NOT be using a dog park. I have seen way too many untrained dogs at dog parks that just become a danger to have around my pups. my pit was attacked at a dog park, it took me years to make her comfortable around strange dogs again. We will walk through dog parks, but we will not be going into the kennel areas and going off leash for unstructured play with strange dogs.*\\n\\n**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**\\n\\n*I'd prefer a brushing once or twice a week, cleaning ears is fine with me, but I do not want to have to pay a groomer for constant haircuts.*\\n\\nPersonal Preferences\\n\\n**10) What size dog are you looking for?**\\n\\n*Medium to large but Extra Large is also fine with me.*\\n\\n**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**\\n\\n*My Cane Corso slobbered me out, I am now looking for as little drool as I can get while maintaining some of the traits I need. He will be my going everywhere he’s allowed to with me, so slobbering can make people uncomfortable in public or at BBQ's or something lol.*\\n\\n**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**\\n\\n*I would love to be able to keep my dog off-lead whenever it is safe to do so. I'd say very important.*\\n\\nDog Personality and Behavior\\n\\n**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**\\n\\n*I actually love both of these personalities. My APBT was a snuggle bug, while my Cane Corso would get up and go lay across the room after a few minutes of petting. If I had to choose, I'd say I prefer a snuggly dog.*\\n\\n**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**\\n\\n*Eagerness to please is a necessity for my plans with my pup.*\\n\\n**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**\\n\\n*I would prefer for the dog to have guarding instincts, for sure. I have a son who plays in my yard and If a stranger enters my yard, they should know IMMEDIATELY  that they are not welcome. (My Corso was EXCEPTIONAL at this, while my Pit just wanted to love on everyone she saw lol). Knocking on my door -- I'd prefer an alert bark. The dog will be put into a place while I answer the door.*\\n\\n**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**\\n\\n*I hope, with the amount of socialization I'd be working on through puppyhood, that this wouldn't be an issue but, if it was, I would absolutely put the work in to fix this behaviour.*\\n\\n**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**\\n\\n*The way people talk about Huskies just bolting over fences or out of doors because they want to roam seems like an absolute nightmare. Insanely high prey drive is also something I'd like to avoid, as I live in an area that has a LOT of rabbits and small dogs walking around with their owners.*\\n\\nLifestyle\\n\\n**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**\\n\\n*The dog will be alone for 4-6hrs, 2-3 times a week.*\\n\\n**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**\\n\\n*Minimal-Moderate shedding, she will be prepping the dogs meals sometimes and playing / training with him often.*\\n\\n**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**\\n\\n*Unfortunately, no, not anymore.*\\n\\n**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**\\n\\n*Yes, I have a son (2 yrs old) and we spend a lot of time around family members ranging from 3 yrs old to 13 yrs old. I worked with my pit, who would get over excited when she saw my son and I am aware of the rough play risk a dog can pose. I am willing and able to work around this.*\\n\\n**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**\\n\\n*Never renting again.*\\n\\n**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**\\n\\n*I live in PA, USA, North America, Earth. No breed restrictions.*\\n\\n**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**\\n\\n*Peak Summer: \\\\\\\\\\\\~85 F, Peak winter: \\\\\\\\\\\\~30 F*\\n\\nAdditional Information and Questions\\n\\n**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**\\n\\n*I have a 2yr old son, a half acre yard surrounded by 6ft fences.

I'm sorry for being another annoying breed recommendation post, but I'd really love the help of more knowledgeable people in looking on what breed fits my lifestyle and some recommendations for further research.\\n\\n  \\n**Introduction**\\n\\n1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\\n   * No. I've had dogs all my life. My girl, Bean, was the first puppy I've ever owned and trained (very successfully; she was often mistaken for a service dog due to how well she followed commands and her attention to her handler, me). However, I have lived with dogs my entire life. \\n2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a\\xa0[reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?\\n   * I've never purchased a dog and would like to rescue, but I am afraid of potential health issues  like Bean's, which is forcing me to consider purchasing a puppy from a reputable breeder with proven healthy lineages. \\n3. Describe your ideal dog.\\n   * I'd love a cuddly dog, handler-focused, clingy, and energetic but not so much as a working breed. I also LOVE dogs with goofy personalities, but that's more specific to the dog and less to a breed, I assume. \\n4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\\n   * Aesthetically, I love Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Anatolian Shepards, Rottweilers, and American Alsatians (which I recently heard are BYB dogs, which really put a damper on things, since they sounded pretty perfect to me). I just LOVE a huge dog with a big ole head and floppy ears. I also love Pitties/Bullies, but I can't really narrow it down to one specific breed, since I've only ever had pittie mix rescues. I just don't know enough about breed standards to provide a standard I'm interested in. I don't typically like curly haired breeds.\\n5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\\n   * Basic obedience and possibly dog sports, if the breed has more intense enrichment needs. This would be a companion dog, not a working dog.\\n6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\\n   * No desire/need to compete or have the dog work, but I'm willing to do anything to meet my dog's needs.\\n\\n**Care Commitments**\\n\\n7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\\n\\n   * At least an hour to two hours a day, but I was planning on leaving them at training/ doggy daycare while I work so that they get appropriate enrichment time. I enjoy training, playing, and walking with my dog and would love a dog that can both do that and also is happy to lay in bed with me on a lazy sunday. \\n\\n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?\\n\\n   * I volunteer at my local shelter and have done animal handling training, which makes me believe that dog parks are unnecessarily dangerous to dogs and can put undue stress on them because of the mixed playstyles and constant rotation of new players. I will not be doing dog parks. I like nature walks, short hikes, taking my dog out on the town (to dog-friendly areas), and I have a large backyard. I'd also walk them at least once a day on top of our outdoor time. \\n\\n9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\\n\\n   * I can groom regularly at home but am much more likely to pay a professional. My Bean was a short-haired bully mix and got groomed every 2-3 weeks. I love long-haired dogs but am afraid they'll overheat (Florida). \\n\\n**Personal Preferences**\\n\\n10) What size dog are you looking for?\\n\\n   * L-XL breeds. The bigger the better so long as their average lifespan is above 10. \\n\\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\\n\\n   * All of it. No such thing as too much from my baby. I deep clean regularly.\\n\\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\\n\\n   * Not at all. I have a fenced backyard and never let my dog off-leash in public due to danger from people or other dogs' behavior. \\n\\n**Dog Personality and Behavior**\\n\\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\\n\\n   * Snugglebug. \\n\\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?\\n\\n   * Either is fine. \\n\\n15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?\\n\\n   * Friendly is preferred, but Aloof is fine. I would not like a dog breed prone to reactivity. Of course, I will be training and de-sensitizing, but there are some more prone to reactivity than others, as you know.\\n\\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\\n\\n   * No. I would prefer that they are either ambivalent or dog-friendly, as I work with many dogs and would like to continue fostering.\\n\\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?\\n\\n   * High prey drive cannot be a factor, I have two cats and foster. I would prefer if they were friendly to small animals or felt the need to protect them, as my deceased baby did. \\n\\n**Lifestyle**\\n\\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\\n\\n   * Almost never. There is almost always someone home, but I will be the sole caretaker. \\n\\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?\\n\\n   * I will be the sole caretaker. The others can let them out to use the bathroom in the backyard, but I will be taking full care of the dog. They have no specific preferences outside of wanting a dog that will not harm other dogs or cats.\\n\\n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?\\n\\n   * Two cats. My mom, whom I live with, has a small lhasapoo that she rescued.\\n\\n21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\\n\\n   * No.\\n\\n22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\\n\\n   * No. I own.\\n\\n23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\\n\\n   * No breed restrictions. \\n\\n24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\\n\\n   * An average summer day is about 95 F with a Feels Like temp that CAN hit 106 due to high humidity. Typical winter day is around 70 F, but sometimes dips below 50 F (not frequently, maybe 30 days total in a year and always scattered between several winter months). \\n\\n**Additional Information and Questions**\\n\\n25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.\\n\\n   * My Bean died of osteosarcoma and I am petrified of another serious illness like osteosarcoma or hemangiosarcoma. I know must dog breeds suffer from cancer, but I would appreciate any feedback on how to lessen their odds of having to go through that. \\n\\n26) Feel free to ask any questions below.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's it!!

I would love any experiences you can share about training dogs with this condition as well as tips on exercising your dog on leash and running with your dog.\\nWe got our Springer Spaniel when he was a year and 2 months and have now had him for seven months. We didn\\'t know about his condition before we adopted him. We live in an apartment but have a large park nearby that we walk him in for at least 1.5 hours a day. We also used to do gun dog training there until his condition no longer allowed the required focus. His leash walking was terrible when he first got here and we have managed to improve it a lot, however he still lounges at birds and as his condition is deteriorating so his his leash walking. We take him out for a half hour leash walk a day to practice. My boyfriends previous dog was a field trial champion gun dog and we currently have a wonderful cocker spaniel bitch that we also do gun dog training with so we are by no means inexperienced dog owners.\\n\\nHis compulsive behavior is staring at walls and panting indoors even when there are no shadows to chase and outside he has outbursts of chasing either the shadow of his own ears or nothing at all. It makes it impossible to get reliable recall. We try to interrupt this behavior at all times. My boyfriend works from home and I study online so we are around most of the time. Inside this is very annoying and disruptive to anything we may be doing as he will randomly jump up and stare at the wall  but it is possible. I am currently trialling tethering him to me (attaching the leash to my waist) so I can get some work done and it seems to be working ok. Outside we have tried managing him with a long leash, however he is very fast and if he manages to slip away he gets tangled in the trees and gets very distressed and over threshold. His condition is continuously worsening. I don\\'t know for how much longer we can keep trying. I am exhausted and feel like crying after every walk.\\n\\nWe have gotten help from a behaviourist. He said we were likely overtraining him with the gun dog training which was making him stressed out and increasing his obsessive behavior so we cut this out. He also said we should try to make every walk a \"good walk\" without him freaking out. As his chasing behavior outside has gotten worse we have had to restrict him to on leash walking to manage his condition as well as fetch and recall training in our buildings tiny fenced dog park. This doesn\\'t seem like nearly enough exercise for a springer spaniel and the pulling that still occurs of walks is causing me constant shoulder pain. I am afraid lack of exercise will worsen his condition. I am trying to fit in training sessions on settle and renew his recall training indoors and in the dog park. If I can get his leash walking a bit better I may be able to take him to walk in the park instead of by the road so nature doesn\\'t become even more exciting. I would also love to take him running. However, I am not sure how to get him to not pull without having to correct all the time. Also, running seems to excite him and increase his pulling. We are currently trying him on mementadine but it doesn\\'t seem to be working. The next step will be selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors. However our behaviourist wants to do neurological tests, orthopaedic exams of his legs and eye tests before we can try them which will take months. I don\\'t know if I can hold on for that long. The insurance is treating this as a pre-existing condition and isn\\'t paying so all these tests will cost us thousands of pounds. He is also really afraid of the vets at this point because we have to keep bringing him so he has special meds to take on days he has to go to the vet. However, they don\\'t seem to be working. We will try to convince them to let us try the SSRIs without all these tests.\\n\\nI am looking for any advice from people that have experience with compulsive disorders in dogs from a training or medication perspective. Does it ever get better? I am so tired. Please don\\'t bring up that \"It\\'s me or the dog!\" episode. I have seen it and I wish any of it worked for us. Any suggestions on providing sufficient exercise and mental stimulation without stressing him out would also be greatly appreciated. If you have dogs with different behavioural issues, what management techniques do you use? Also, do any of you run with your dogs on lead? How did you get them not to pull?', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/s7x8br/our_springer_spaniels_compulsive_disorder_is/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it.

We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life.

Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 5, 'content': 'Questions about Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD)\\nLast week, I started noticing signs of cognitive decline in my 11-year-old dog.

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to\\nproduce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.\\n\\nAnxitane\\n-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.\\n-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.\\n\\nValerian Root:\\n-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.\\n-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals.

The nutritionist said they wouldn't give us any recommendations unless we had the vet on the line as well.

If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**\\n\\n*No, I have owned a Cane Corso, American Pitbull Terrier and a GSD Mix. All of my dogs were trained in basic obedience (Sit, Stay, Down, Recall, loose lead walking)*\\n\\n**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**\\n\\n*I just lost my Cane Corse to Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and my APBT to bone cancer within a year of each other. They were 10 and 9, respectively. So, I'll be going the reputable breeder route to minimize any health issues moving forward.*\\n\\n**Describe your ideal dog.**\\n\\n*My dream dog is medium - X- Large, minimal-moderate shedding, easily trainable, happy on a hike or in the house for a movie night. They will accompany me almost everywhere, other than work.*\\n\\n**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**\\n\\n*My dream breed is a Dutch Shepherd, they are the most beautiful breed I've ever seen. Unfortunately, my research has built up some fear of not being able to sufficiently meet the breeds physical exercise requirements, (From my understanding, they are like Malinois level energizer bunnies that just go and go) and I've also read that they do not enjoy cuddling after a days work, which is something I absolutely need in a breed lol.*\\n\\n*This has led me to lean towards the GSD breed. I do not particularly like the look of the showline GSD, but their temperament and exercise requirements seem to be exactly what I need. I LOVE the look of the dark sable working line shepherds, with the more square structure and healthier hips / elbows, but I have the same hesitations that come with the Dutch Shepherds regarding the 23.5hrs a day of exercise required to make them happy lol.*\\n\\n*I also feel like the Doberman could be ideal for me, but their breed-specific health issues seem way too common. Kind of scares me, do NOT want another dog to get sick on me.*\\n\\n**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**\\n\\n*Advanced Obedience (Strict heel, down, stay, sit, place, recall, off-lead obedience for hikes), I will be putting a TON of time and energy into the socialization of my pup so he can go to lots of places with me and be comfortable and happy, and, potentially some bite and scent work training that could translate into IPO-style dog sports for fun.*\\n\\n**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**\\n\\n*This is a possibilty down the road when I think he's bored with our normal training routines. I have 0 experience in this field, however.*\\n\\nCare Commitments\\n\\n**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**\\n\\n*I will be doing about 30-60 mins of obedience training, 60-90mins of physcial play, 2-3 walks about 2 miles each, and as much socialization I can each day. At home, my family will be interacting with him nonstop (light play indoors, cuddling, etc.)*\\n\\n**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**\\n\\n*an hour - hour and a half of physical exercise is a realistic number I can hit daily (more on weekends as I go for hikes or walk through state parks on saturday mornings), I also calculate mental and physical exercise as separate activities, so we will also be doing another 30/60 mins of mental exercise via obedience training and puzzles. This includes walks around the neghborhood, playing in our fenced backyard, going to any of the local parks, hiking, etc.*\\n\\n*I will NOT be using a dog park. I have seen way too many untrained dogs at dog parks that just become a danger to have around my pups. my pit was attacked at a dog park, it took me years to make her comfortable around strange dogs again. We will walk through dog parks, but we will not be going into the kennel areas and going off leash for unstructured play with strange dogs.*\\n\\n**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**\\n\\n*I'd prefer a brushing once or twice a week, cleaning ears is fine with me, but I do not want to have to pay a groomer for constant haircuts.*\\n\\nPersonal Preferences\\n\\n**10) What size dog are you looking for?**\\n\\n*Medium to large but Extra Large is also fine with me.*\\n\\n**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**\\n\\n*My Cane Corso slobbered me out, I am now looking for as little drool as I can get while maintaining some of the traits I need. He will be my going everywhere he’s allowed to with me, so slobbering can make people uncomfortable in public or at BBQ's or something lol.*\\n\\n**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**\\n\\n*I would love to be able to keep my dog off-lead whenever it is safe to do so. I'd say very important.*\\n\\nDog Personality and Behavior\\n\\n**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**\\n\\n*I actually love both of these personalities. My APBT was a snuggle bug, while my Cane Corso would get up and go lay across the room after a few minutes of petting. If I had to choose, I'd say I prefer a snuggly dog.*\\n\\n**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**\\n\\n*Eagerness to please is a necessity for my plans with my pup.*\\n\\n**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**\\n\\n*I would prefer for the dog to have guarding instincts, for sure. I have a son who plays in my yard and If a stranger enters my yard, they should know IMMEDIATELY  that they are not welcome. (My Corso was EXCEPTIONAL at this, while my Pit just wanted to love on everyone she saw lol). Knocking on my door -- I'd prefer an alert bark. The dog will be put into a place while I answer the door.*\\n\\n**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**\\n\\n*I hope, with the amount of socialization I'd be working on through puppyhood, that this wouldn't be an issue but, if it was, I would absolutely put the work in to fix this behaviour.*\\n\\n**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**\\n\\n*The way people talk about Huskies just bolting over fences or out of doors because they want to roam seems like an absolute nightmare. Insanely high prey drive is also something I'd like to avoid, as I live in an area that has a LOT of rabbits and small dogs walking around with their owners.*\\n\\nLifestyle\\n\\n**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**\\n\\n*The dog will be alone for 4-6hrs, 2-3 times a week.*\\n\\n**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**\\n\\n*Minimal-Moderate shedding, she will be prepping the dogs meals sometimes and playing / training with him often.*\\n\\n**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**\\n\\n*Unfortunately, no, not anymore.*\\n\\n**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**\\n\\n*Yes, I have a son (2 yrs old) and we spend a lot of time around family members ranging from 3 yrs old to 13 yrs old. I worked with my pit, who would get over excited when she saw my son and I am aware of the rough play risk a dog can pose. I am willing and able to work around this.*\\n\\n**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**\\n\\n*Never renting again.*\\n\\n**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**\\n\\n*I live in PA, USA, North America, Earth.

I'm sorry for being another annoying breed recommendation post, but I'd really love the help of more knowledgeable people in looking on what breed fits my lifestyle and some recommendations for further research.\\n\\n  \\n**Introduction**\\n\\n1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\\n   * No. I've had dogs all my life. My girl, Bean, was the first puppy I've ever owned and trained (very successfully; she was often mistaken for a service dog due to how well she followed commands and her attention to her handler, me). However, I have lived with dogs my entire life. \\n2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a\\xa0[reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?\\n   * I've never purchased a dog and would like to rescue, but I am afraid of potential health issues  like Bean's, which is forcing me to consider purchasing a puppy from a reputable breeder with proven healthy lineages. \\n3. Describe your ideal dog.\\n   * I'd love a cuddly dog, handler-focused, clingy, and energetic but not so much as a working breed. I also LOVE dogs with goofy personalities, but that's more specific to the dog and less to a breed, I assume. \\n4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\\n   * Aesthetically, I love Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Anatolian Shepards, Rottweilers, and American Alsatians (which I recently heard are BYB dogs, which really put a damper on things, since they sounded pretty perfect to me). I just LOVE a huge dog with a big ole head and floppy ears. I also love Pitties/Bullies, but I can't really narrow it down to one specific breed, since I've only ever had pittie mix rescues. I just don't know enough about breed standards to provide a standard I'm interested in. I don't typically like curly haired breeds.\\n5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\\n   * Basic obedience and possibly dog sports, if the breed has more intense enrichment needs. This would be a companion dog, not a working dog.\\n6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\\n   * No desire/need to compete or have the dog work, but I'm willing to do anything to meet my dog's needs.\\n\\n**Care Commitments**\\n\\n7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\\n\\n   * At least an hour to two hours a day, but I was planning on leaving them at training/ doggy daycare while I work so that they get appropriate enrichment time. I enjoy training, playing, and walking with my dog and would love a dog that can both do that and also is happy to lay in bed with me on a lazy sunday. \\n\\n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?\\n\\n   * I volunteer at my local shelter and have done animal handling training, which makes me believe that dog parks are unnecessarily dangerous to dogs and can put undue stress on them because of the mixed playstyles and constant rotation of new players. I will not be doing dog parks. I like nature walks, short hikes, taking my dog out on the town (to dog-friendly areas), and I have a large backyard. I'd also walk them at least once a day on top of our outdoor time. \\n\\n9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\\n\\n   * I can groom regularly at home but am much more likely to pay a professional. My Bean was a short-haired bully mix and got groomed every 2-3 weeks. I love long-haired dogs but am afraid they'll overheat (Florida). \\n\\n**Personal Preferences**\\n\\n10) What size dog are you looking for?\\n\\n   * L-XL breeds. The bigger the better so long as their average lifespan is above 10. \\n\\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\\n\\n   * All of it. No such thing as too much from my baby. I deep clean regularly.\\n\\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\\n\\n   * Not at all. I have a fenced backyard and never let my dog off-leash in public due to danger from people or other dogs' behavior. \\n\\n**Dog Personality and Behavior**\\n\\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\\n\\n   * Snugglebug. \\n\\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?\\n\\n   * Either is fine. \\n\\n15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?\\n\\n   * Friendly is preferred, but Aloof is fine. I would not like a dog breed prone to reactivity. Of course, I will be training and de-sensitizing, but there are some more prone to reactivity than others, as you know.\\n\\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\\n\\n   * No. I would prefer that they are either ambivalent or dog-friendly, as I work with many dogs and would like to continue fostering.\\n\\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?\\n\\n   * High prey drive cannot be a factor, I have two cats and foster. I would prefer if they were friendly to small animals or felt the need to protect them, as my deceased baby did. \\n\\n**Lifestyle**\\n\\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\\n\\n   * Almost never. There is almost always someone home, but I will be the sole caretaker. \\n\\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?\\n\\n   * I will be the sole caretaker. The others can let them out to use the bathroom in the backyard, but I will be taking full care of the dog. They have no specific preferences outside of wanting a dog that will not harm other dogs or cats.\\n\\n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?\\n\\n   * Two cats. My mom, whom I live with, has a small lhasapoo that she rescued.\\n\\n21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\\n\\n   * No.\\n\\n22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\\n\\n   * No. I own.\\n\\n23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\\n\\n   * No breed restrictions. \\n\\n24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\\n\\n   * An average summer day is about 95 F with a Feels Like temp that CAN hit 106 due to high humidity. Typical winter day is around 70 F, but sometimes dips below 50 F (not frequently, maybe 30 days total in a year and always scattered between several winter months). \\n\\n**Additional Information and Questions**\\n\\n25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.\\n\\n   * My Bean died of osteosarcoma and I am petrified of another serious illness like osteosarcoma or hemangiosarcoma. I know must dog breeds suffer from cancer, but I would appreciate any feedback on how to lessen their odds of having to go through that. \\n\\n26) Feel free to ask any questions below.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's it!!

I would love any experiences you can share about training dogs with this condition as well as tips on exercising your dog on leash and running with your dog.\\nWe got our Springer Spaniel when he was a year and 2 months and have now had him for seven months. We didn\\'t know about his condition before we adopted him. We live in an apartment but have a large park nearby that we walk him in for at least 1.5 hours a day. We also used to do gun dog training there until his condition no longer allowed the required focus. His leash walking was terrible when he first got here and we have managed to improve it a lot, however he still lounges at birds and as his condition is deteriorating so his his leash walking. We take him out for a half hour leash walk a day to practice. My boyfriends previous dog was a field trial champion gun dog and we currently have a wonderful cocker spaniel bitch that we also do gun dog training with so we are by no means inexperienced dog owners.\\n\\nHis compulsive behavior is staring at walls and panting indoors even when there are no shadows to chase and outside he has outbursts of chasing either the shadow of his own ears or nothing at all. It makes it impossible to get reliable recall. We try to interrupt this behavior at all times. My boyfriend works from home and I study online so we are around most of the time. Inside this is very annoying and disruptive to anything we may be doing as he will randomly jump up and stare at the wall  but it is possible. I am currently trialling tethering him to me (attaching the leash to my waist) so I can get some work done and it seems to be working ok. Outside we have tried managing him with a long leash, however he is very fast and if he manages to slip away he gets tangled in the trees and gets very distressed and over threshold. His condition is continuously worsening. I don\\'t know for how much longer we can keep trying. I am exhausted and feel like crying after every walk.\\n\\nWe have gotten help from a behaviourist. He said we were likely overtraining him with the gun dog training which was making him stressed out and increasing his obsessive behavior so we cut this out. He also said we should try to make every walk a \"good walk\" without him freaking out. As his chasing behavior outside has gotten worse we have had to restrict him to on leash walking to manage his condition as well as fetch and recall training in our buildings tiny fenced dog park. This doesn\\'t seem like nearly enough exercise for a springer spaniel and the pulling that still occurs of walks is causing me constant shoulder pain. I am afraid lack of exercise will worsen his condition. I am trying to fit in training sessions on settle and renew his recall training indoors and in the dog park. If I can get his leash walking a bit better I may be able to take him to walk in the park instead of by the road so nature doesn\\'t become even more exciting. I would also love to take him running. However, I am not sure how to get him to not pull without having to correct all the time. Also, running seems to excite him and increase his pulling. We are currently trying him on mementadine but it doesn\\'t seem to be working. The next step will be selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors. However our behaviourist wants to do neurological tests, orthopaedic exams of his legs and eye tests before we can try them which will take months. I don\\'t know if I can hold on for that long. The insurance is treating this as a pre-existing condition and isn\\'t paying so all these tests will cost us thousands of pounds. He is also really afraid of the vets at this point because we have to keep bringing him so he has special meds to take on days he has to go to the vet. However, they don\\'t seem to be working. We will try to convince them to let us try the SSRIs without all these tests.\\n\\nI am looking for any advice from people that have experience with compulsive disorders in dogs from a training or medication perspective. Does it ever get better? I am so tired. Please don\\'t bring up that \"It\\'s me or the dog!\" episode. I have seen it and I wish any of it worked for us. Any suggestions on providing sufficient exercise and mental stimulation without stressing him out would also be greatly appreciated. If you have dogs with different behavioural issues, what management techniques do you use? Also, do any of you run with your dogs on lead? How did you get them not to pull?', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/s7x8br/our_springer_spaniels_compulsive_disorder_is/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it.

Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life.

Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 5, 'content': 'Questions about Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD)\\nLast week, I started noticing signs of cognitive decline in my 11-year-old dog.

The nutritionist said they wouldn't give us any recommendations unless we had the vet on the line as well.

I was searching for answers everywhere and could not find anything comprehensive. Even our vet wasn\\'t sure what was happening with our dog or what to suggest. Of course, what works for our dog may not work for everyone but it may give you some hope!\\n\\nWe have a 15 yo lab mix who started having incontinence issues approximately seven months ago. Shortly thereafter she started hanging out in odd places (like under the dining room table in another room when she\\'s usually wherever we are), climbing on furniture (think: standing on top of the dining room table which she had NEVER done before), panting/pacing constantly (would lay down and immediately get back up), climbing into the tub while we were showering and standing under the water (a dog who hates baths), and just would not settle down, day or night. We took her to the vet who suspected separation anxiety.\\n\\nAt first we first tried CBD supplements recommended by our vet which did nothing. We tried another brand of CBD - nothing. We also tried the Thunder Shirt, Thunderwunders, calming music, leaving the tv on, putting something with our scent on her bed...nothing helped. \\n\\nSix months ago we started her on ??mg Prozac (sorry, cannot find the records) and 100mg Trazodone which may have helped a little at first but then did nothing. We were getting frustrated, not sleeping due to her being up all night and were concerned about her quality of life. We\\'d have to put her on a leash just so we could sit down to eat dinner because we feared her climbing/falling off something and injuring herself. We considered it may be the end for her.\\n\\nAfter a lot of research I found out about Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and subsequently Anipryl,  which is apparently the only medicine prescribed specifically for Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. Even our vets were not very familiar with Anipryl, but said they would prescribe it if we wanted to try it. After a daunting withdrawal from the Prozac (we learned after having our vet contact the manufacturer that she needed to be off the Prozac *14 days* before starting the Anipryl; our vet initially suggested 2 days which just shows how little they knew - it could have killed her), we started her on 15 mg Anipryl during the day and switched the Trazodone for .5 mg Alprazolam/5 mg Melatonin at night. **This combination made a world of difference.**\\n\\nNot to be dramatic, but it almost feels like we have our old dog back. She is no longer climbing on furniture, panting/pacing throughout the day. She does have an occasional \"episode\" but they are rare and short lived. She still gets up in the night and will dig in her bed, but she will eventually settle and sleep. We also have her in diapers for the incontinence issue and these have been life-changing as well. THEY WORK. Sometimes we\\'ll double them up (like at night) and put a washable diaper on top so she can\\'t wiggle out of them, but it saves us from having to wash her bed, and it saves our floors & furniture. FWIW she is also on estrogen but it does not prevent her from peeing inside (another thing she\\'d never done before). \\n\\nIt has been about seven months since she started exhibiting symptoms and she is doing so much better now. Aside from the CCD she is in great health; even if it only affords us a few more months with her, we are so happy to have found this protocol that works for us.\\n\\nI just wanted to share in case anyone is having similar issues and is not sure what to do.

I would love any experiences you can share about training dogs with this condition as well as tips on exercising your dog on leash and running with your dog.\\nWe got our Springer Spaniel when he was a year and 2 months and have now had him for seven months. We didn\\'t know about his condition before we adopted him. We live in an apartment but have a large park nearby that we walk him in for at least 1.5 hours a day. We also used to do gun dog training there until his condition no longer allowed the required focus. His leash walking was terrible when he first got here and we have managed to improve it a lot, however he still lounges at birds and as his condition is deteriorating so his his leash walking. We take him out for a half hour leash walk a day to practice. My boyfriends previous dog was a field trial champion gun dog and we currently have a wonderful cocker spaniel bitch that we also do gun dog training with so we are by no means inexperienced dog owners.\\n\\nHis compulsive behavior is staring at walls and panting indoors even when there are no shadows to chase and outside he has outbursts of chasing either the shadow of his own ears or nothing at all. It makes it impossible to get reliable recall. We try to interrupt this behavior at all times. My boyfriend works from home and I study online so we are around most of the time. Inside this is very annoying and disruptive to anything we may be doing as he will randomly jump up and stare at the wall  but it is possible. I am currently trialling tethering him to me (attaching the leash to my waist) so I can get some work done and it seems to be working ok. Outside we have tried managing him with a long leash, however he is very fast and if he manages to slip away he gets tangled in the trees and gets very distressed and over threshold. His condition is continuously worsening. I don\\'t know for how much longer we can keep trying. I am exhausted and feel like crying after every walk.\\n\\nWe have gotten help from a behaviourist. He said we were likely overtraining him with the gun dog training which was making him stressed out and increasing his obsessive behavior so we cut this out. He also said we should try to make every walk a \"good walk\" without him freaking out. As his chasing behavior outside has gotten worse we have had to restrict him to on leash walking to manage his condition as well as fetch and recall training in our buildings tiny fenced dog park. This doesn\\'t seem like nearly enough exercise for a springer spaniel and the pulling that still occurs of walks is causing me constant shoulder pain. I am afraid lack of exercise will worsen his condition. I am trying to fit in training sessions on settle and renew his recall training indoors and in the dog park. If I can get his leash walking a bit better I may be able to take him to walk in the park instead of by the road so nature doesn\\'t become even more exciting. I would also love to take him running. However, I am not sure how to get him to not pull without having to correct all the time. Also, running seems to excite him and increase his pulling. We are currently trying him on mementadine but it doesn\\'t seem to be working. The next step will be selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors. However our behaviourist wants to do neurological tests, orthopaedic exams of his legs and eye tests before we can try them which will take months. I don\\'t know if I can hold on for that long. The insurance is treating this as a pre-existing condition and isn\\'t paying so all these tests will cost us thousands of pounds. He is also really afraid of the vets at this point because we have to keep bringing him so he has special meds to take on days he has to go to the vet. However, they don\\'t seem to be working. We will try to convince them to let us try the SSRIs without all these tests.\\n\\nI am looking for any advice from people that have experience with compulsive disorders in dogs from a training or medication perspective. Does it ever get better? I am so tired. Please don\\'t bring up that \"It\\'s me or the dog!\" episode. I have seen it and I wish any of it worked for us. Any suggestions on providing sufficient exercise and mental stimulation without stressing him out would also be greatly appreciated. If you have dogs with different behavioural issues, what management techniques do you use? Also, do any of you run with your dogs on lead?

When I met my now husband he was living alone with his little dog. His home was tidy but smelled awful of dog pee and there were dried turds we found in the basement when we moved. His little dog is a chihuahua dachshund mix and was morbidly obese. It seemed he was loved but struggling in the behavior department and his owner was not taking the best care of him. He would leave him home alone all day which I assumed was the cause for going to the bathroom in the house because when you would let him out into the fenced yard he would do his business immediately and come in for his treat. Little guy was very fat, barked incessantly at the dog, would get the zoomies for half an hour straight when you came into the house but knew basic commands and once he calmed down would just go take a nap or chew a bone peacefully. When DH moved into my home I did not own a dog but did all I knew how to help the little dude. He went to the vet for overdue care, was put on a new food and spent a lot more time outside running and getting exercise. \\n\\nWe found that he was not going potty in the house because he wasn’t well trained but because he liked to mark. I would take him out for a long walk and he would do his business and mark outside quite a bit. Then right after coming in, I would catch him squeezing what he could out right onto my couch. He is crate trained and loves to chill in his crate so I found that he could just not be trusted to be left unsupervised and used the crate intermittently to ensure he would do as little marking as possible. I am not a fan of filth and have a daughter that I prefer to keep a clean home for. He would find opportunities like when my back was turned in the kitchen to go mark. Very frustrating because I wanted him to feel like part of the family and not be locked up all the time. \\n\\nLittle guy has an extremely loud and aggressive bark, he reacts to any sound at the door as well as imperceivable triggers. He has multiple barking episodes an hour and it takes a long time to calm him. This issue has only gotten worse over the years. He will also whine and cry out/bark in his crate for hours. You will let him out and give water and let him go to the bathroom, but all he cares about is checking to see if there’s anything on the kitchen floor and then he’s off to sniff the couch (we’ve had quite a few couches be replaced since he moved in) and lift his leg. So it’s back in the crate. He makes all this noise not just when people are in the room moving around but through the night and when no one is home. I’m not able to relax for even a second. \\n\\nAlthough he loves to spend time with me and my daughter he has bit us both multiple times in our hands and face. He will do it when we help unwrap his lead outside from around a chair leg, he will be giving kisses and suddenly bite, he will happily run in his crate when we go to leave, gently take a treat from your fingers then snap at you as you close the crate. Generally unpredictably with the exception of when he is resource guarding. He used to be allowed out at times when people were eating but just telling him to back off he would get aggressive. \\n\\nWe now have a very sweet bulldog who is 2.5. We got her as a puppy and up until 6 month’s ago, her and little guy were besties. He began snapping at her, biting her to resource guard and just doing all he could to maintain dominance over the situation. The problem is that he is 13lbs and she is 57lbs. So one day it became an altercation. She was not going to tolerate being attacked for wanting to be in the same room as him and the people he wanted to hang out with. She tackled him to the ground and pinned him. She did not hurt him, or try to bite but he screamed bloody murder and was doing all he could to bite her. I reached in to pull them apart and got bit to the point of needing medical care as the meat of my palm was ripped open quite deeply.  The dogs have not been able to be in the same room together since. They remain crated and switched out through the day. \\n\\nAfter a couple of years he is at a very healthy weight and maintaining it. He has routine vet care and we’ve asked if he is in any pain as he is now an older dog. He is perfectly healthy and his issues seem to be completely behavioral. After the big fight, we discussed the issues with our vet and she suggested he be put down. We opted to try Prozac which he has been on for 4 months now. We’ve seen no difference. We’ve also contacted three different trainers who said they felt they would be unable to help due to his age. DH down plays the severity of the issues, points out everything the other dog does wrong, ignores and avoids the amount of daily effort and the stress it causes me throughout each day. He absolutely will not hear of rehousing the dog and it would break my heart to have him put down even if this is what the vet suggested.I am now 7 months pregnant and the stress of dealing with this dog is really putting me over the edge. I am not looking forward to him waking the baby up and later having to navigate keeping him away from the baby for fear of biting, as well as not allowing him near baby’s things as he may try to pee on them. \\n\\nOut of stubbornness of my husband I am left to handle full time work, carrying and later caring for the little one, maintaining the home and dealing with the constant chaos that is coordinating/mitigating dog issues.

He has also become food obsessed and is starting to bite. I’ve had him for most of his life and neither of these is a big deal to me aside from sleeping arrangements because he goes through phases where he *won’t lay down without me laying next to him and even then often wants to get up in the night.*   \\n\\n\\nTaken him to three different vets and had X-rays and other scans and he seems in excellent physical health; his teeth aren’t optimal but so far we haven’t had any major issues. He tends to wander and cry a lot… I was worried he’s in pain from arthritis but even with medication (CBD and an NSAID) the symptoms haven’t changed. He was having seizures for a bit but the CBD seems to have solved a lot and he’s going on two months seizure free. Deafness and blindness are creeping in but I've had older and more disabled dogs and this is different.  \\n\\n\\nHe sleeps with me every night and I have to let him up and down a lot; it’s inconvenient but I adore him as does my girlfriend so this is really just about him. He stopped responding to his name or any cue commands like snapping or clapping(he was never great at these anyways) over a year or two ago. He uses a pee pad in the house to go but has started doing weird things like pooping in the kitchen or dragging his refuse places. If we try and walk him with the other dog it's impossibly slow and if we let him out into the field we have he just stands there, yet sometimes he will get crazed and start darting around the apartment like he's looking for something and get very active. He has no interest in toys and never has, never really engaged in play with other dogs.  \\n\\n\\n**TL:DR I guess I'm just looking for perspective and advice on this stage from similar dog friends and what the outlook is; I've had old dogs before and the physical side always came into play first.

TL;DR at end. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads and/or comments. Formatted on mobile. I tried to organize it in a way that makes sense. \\n\\nPicture of my dog and 19 pictures of some (not all) of the damage he’s done when left alone in the last three months [can be found here](https://imgur.com/a/ViQUkWG). Warning, there are some light bloodstains in some pictures. \\n\\n# General Background\\n\\n* My dog Khan is about 10 or 11 years old, he weighs 60lbs, and he is very loved. I adopted him a little over 4.5 years ago. The shelter said he was a black mouth mountain cur, but he’s probably mixed. All I know about his past is he was shipped up from the south like many dogs are to avoid kill shelters, and a woman had him for a month before me but gave him back because he was too clingy. \\n\\n* Khan has always been clingy, but in the past three months his separation anxiety has become very severe and keeps escalating. I’ve brought him to the vet (bloodwork was fine) and consulted with a separation anxiety behaviorist, and they both think in addition to the separation anxiety he is also suffering from canine cognitive dysfunction (dog dementia). He seems physically fine, and he has a cushioned step for my bed in case he is hiding joint pain, which he uses sometimes. He is on Prozac and Valium, details can be found below. \\n\\n* For years he was totally fine being left alone even though he was clingy. He always had free range, he’s not a crate dog. The vet and behaviorist both said a crate would make him suffer even more and I agree. \\n\\n* We live in an apartment in a city right next to a huge park and a huge dog park. My room is also pretty big. He goes to the park twice a day and goes out once more at night. When I\\'m at work he has a dogwalker who he loves. \\n\\n* We also live with a roommate who he is very bonded to, he used to sleep with her instead of me every night (heartbreaking!) until the dementia set in and she couldn\\'t handle him waking her up, now she shuts him out of her room at all times which I think stresses him out more. This all started after she went on vacation one week a month for about three months but didn\\'t stop when she came back, she\\'s been home for three months now. But she is going to be gone three weeks next month and that means he\\'s going to freak out even more than he has been the past three months when she was home. The other night she told me I should consider putting him to sleep which shocked me. Then she suggested I give him away which also shocked me. It would be so cruel to abandon a dog with abandonment issues, and I doubt anyone else would do as much as I am to help him. I love him so much, I thought she did too. I think the apartment damage is really stressing her out but I\\'m going to pay to fix it. We\\'re friends but the whole situation is becoming a source of tension. My family and co-workers also think it\\'s time. \\n\\n* For three years we lived with my exSO who he was very bonded with, but he handled the transition when we moved about 10 months ago way better than I expected. They still see each other about once a month. He frequently travels out of state for work though so he can\\'t really help out a lot. \\n\\n* Whoever trained him did a great job, I worry they were strict though because he isn’t very playful. He likes to chew on antlers and ostrich knuckles and plays with a frozen treat Kong but only for a little bit and only if we are home, he won\\'t touch them if we\\'re gone. He never destroyed anything in the past. I could leave a steak on the floor and tell him not to touch it and leave the apartment and he wouldn’t. So what I’m about to describe is very out of character. We eventually decided to get a tall thick metal gate to keep him in my room because he was so destructive to the apartment and my roommate\\'s things.\\n\\n* I work full time, but in four days (have a dogwalker as mentioned above). So three days of the week I\\'m home all day with him, I don\\'t go out and don\\'t have anyone over because that stresses him out too. Sometimes I have errands or appointments and have to leave a little bit. I used to practice leaving in short increments to desensitize him before I was told by a behaviorist that was futile because of the severity of anxiety, more details on that below. I have to practically wrestle him into my gated room before I leave, he really resists it. If I could work from home I would. \\n\\n# Symptoms\\n\\n### Separation Anxiety\\n\\n* I want to preface this by saying I value him way above the damage he has caused, and I do not punish him for it. In the past three months he has clawed/chewed up six door frames, six doors, a windowsill, a tall teal standing cabinet (and knocked it over and shredded the shreddable contents twice), a dresser, a vanity, a laundry basket, a chair, part of a vacuum cleaner, two thick metal bars from a gate, etc. I leave cardboard for him and he\\'ll chew that but it doesn\\'t prevent him from scratching up wood. I\\'m really worried he\\'s going to hurt himself, so far he\\'s split a few nails and when he ripped the bars off the gate there was blood. He also pushed my vanity into my room and the legs are unstable, so for weeks all my furniture has been clumped in a corner surrounded by barriers so he cant move it, but he still finds ways to chew and scratch it. \\n\\n* He never has accidents, but gets terrified when I take him out to pee at night and he usually refuses and drags me back to the stoop. In the daytime he doesn\\'t pee on multiple things on our walks like he used to, just pees once. He won\\'t eat or drink or play with his toys when we\\'re gone. When he panics he pants and individual drops of drool fall, by the time I get home there\\'s a huge puddle by the gate. I\\'ve filmed him before and the destruction starts as soon as I leave. Some days the Valium works better than other days and he barely destroys anything. \\n\\n* He also is not as interested in food and only eats a little bit at a time, instead of excitedly wolfing it down. He usually still likes treats though, unless he is panicking, then he refuses to eat anything. As I mentioned before he will not eat or drink alone. \\n\\n### Dementia\\n\\n* The reason he also was diagnosed with dementia is sometimes he\\'ll just stare off into space in the middle of the room and he\\'ll try to go into a different apartment than ours after walks and he panics even when I\\'m home (but is only destructive when alone), and he gets worse at night. He forgets his \"sit\" command unless the Valium works better than usual, things like that. \\n\\n* At nighttime he frequently wakes me up panicking. At his worst he\\'ll wake me up every 20 minutes, pretty much as soon as I fall back asleep. If I\\'m lucky and the Valium works better than usual it happens in two hour increments. He will be shaking and panting and have a crazy look in his eye, and he\\'ll jam his nose in my eye socket and thrust his head upward, or sit on my face or chest or step on my long hair and rip it out or straddle my chest and refuse to move trapping me, etc. I used to try taking him outside but he doesn\\'t have to pee because he just panics there too, like I described earlier. \\n\\n# Medication\\n\\n* He has been on Prozac titrating up for two months, he’s been on 60mg for about two weeks. He also gets a total of 30mg of Valium a day, split into two doses for when I’m at work and nighttime. In the past we tried Xanax and Trazodone but neither helped. He also gets strong strength dog CBD everyday. \\n\\n* The Prozac/Valium/CBD is helping a little, but not that much, and it’s clear he’s going to keep getting worse. Last time I talked to my vet she said she was out of ideas for medication but I’ll reach out to her again. I was told to see a board certified vet behaviorist, essentially a vet psychiatrist, because they have more training in the nuances of brain medication, but there are very few in the country and I was quoted $900 for a consultation which unfortunately I can’t afford. I was also told by the separation anxiety specialist that we can’t work on training him unless the medication worked because when dogs are too anxious their brains can’t create memories necessary for training. \\n\\n# Other Things I\\'ve Tried\\n\\nThings I\\'ve tried (open to ideas if you have them): \\n* Taping cardboard over the door, thick gaffe and duct tape over the door, taping a towel over the door, putting a vacuum in the way, doing a lemon/vinegar rub (this worked but caused him to move onto furniture). \\n* Various types of calming treats and a calming pheromone scent. \\n* Medication described above. \\n* Extra exercise and longs walks.\\n* Leaving a fan, lights, Bob Ross, and calming dog music playlist or long audiobook on. Leaving a frozen Kong which he won\\'t touch anymore.\\n* Thundershirt. \\n* My ex took him for three days so I could paint my dark navy room a light color which I thought might help with the nighttime anxiety but it hasn\\'t. I also spackled and painted over some of the damage but his first day back he tore the door frame up again. \\n* Getting ready to leave but sitting around, leaving in seconds to minutes increasing increments, not acknowledging or making a big deal about coming home or leaving.\\n\\n# Other Factors\\n\\n* I try really hard to be patient with him at night but the sleep deprivation is taking a toll. Unfortunately when I get woken up repeatedly I sometimes lose control of my mood and react before thinking and get frustrated with him and push him away or yell, then I feel so guilty because I know it\\'s not his fault and getting frustrated makes it worse. Full disclosure I have bipolar disorder and anxiety, I\\'m well medicated and have been for years but can\\'t take my insomnia medication anymore because him waking me up on it would make me hallucinate. \\n\\n* I\\'m trying to keep the effects on all of this on me out of my decision about when it\\'s time to let go, even though it is taking a financial (vet bills, apartment repairs, various potential remedies, etc), physical, and mental toll. The decision when/if to let go will be made with his quality of life in mind first and foremost. I just don\\'t know though. I feel bad because I know how panic attacks feel and I don\\'t know if it\\'s cruel to keep him alive when he experiences them so frequently and for so long. He is also terrified of thunderstorms and fireworks, and doesn\\'t handle heat well (for example frantically digs holes to lay in and cool down during walks despite drinking lots of water) and it\\'s getting to be that time of the year. My roommate also just dropped the bombshell that she wants to terminate the lease this September 2019 instead of 2020 like we planned, and I don\\'t think he can handle another move. I love him so much. He\\'s definitely suffering but has good moments sometimes, but the bad times are bad. He isn\\'t the dog he used to be, and I know the prognosis is his brain will keep deteriorating. \\n\\nTL;DR My senior dog has severe separation anxiety and dementia and is not responding to medication. He is physically fine, I don\\'t know when/if his mental suffering is too cruel for him to endure.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/bg810v/help_i_dont_know_whenif_its_time_to_let_go_of_my/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': \"I need help with a dog who has an extremely high prey drive with a major lack of impulse control\\nFor starters, I am a dog trainer. I've been in the field for nearly 10 years and have never seen a dog quite like this one. Gir, is a frenchie/pit mix who is roughly 9m old. He has come such a long way when it comes to walking on leash, leave it, waiting at doors, focus work, etc. so he has definitely shown some improvement in his impulse control. The problem comes in when the kids have any kind of balls on the trampoline. On leash, he will easily leave them alone and not try to get them. Full slack and waiting patiently. Off leash, is a completely different story. He will jump underneath the trampoline and pop the ball into the air continuously until we are finally able to pull him away. He will not stop on his own and can get snappy when you are trying to get him to come out because he is in a heightened state of arousal or over stimulated. When I can finally get him out, he will have abrasions on his nose, cuts on his tongue, and he will easily walk away and drop into a down because he's beyond exhausted. I've talked to a vet who doesn't think it's any form of OCD or CCD. I'm pretty sure the reason why he is doing it is because he essentially can't fulfill his need to catch the ball, each time he goes for it, it pops and goes to a new spot, thus restarting the cycle. I can't figure out what I can do to help work with him more than he has already learned. I even had him on a 20ft leash and he was great, wouldn't even try, but the second the leash is off, he is 100% unreliable in any kind of recall or leave it. \\n\\nWe've done hand targeting to help his recall, we've done Leave It extensively on and off leash and he is around 90% reliable outside of this situation. He understands his cues for going inside, to settle, and so on, but I have hit a wall with this one. I would love any recommendations you can give, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels trying to figure this out and I don't have any other trainers in the area to brainstorm with. \\n\\nTLDR: Dog has a high prey drive when it can't fulfill it's need to catch the prey, outside of that is strongly reliable in other commands on and off leash.

I work at home so I am with the pets all day, my wife works outside the house and is home mornings and evenings. The cat hides in the basement since the puppy has been introduced. We want her to eventually be able to be comfortable around the young chi to join us upstairs. Dogs get walked multiple (4+) times per day. They also both sleep with us in our bed.\\n\\nWe found the younger chihuahua this past August on the street. When no one claimed him, we decided to keep him and he was neutered eight weeks ago. He is very sweet and affectionate 95% of the time, but occasionally will snap, go berserk and viciously snap at the 13m chihuahua and occasionally my wife.  He has now bit my wife on 3 occasions. Each time these bites happen if he is disturbed when resting or woken up. We will also have to hold him back because he has a tendency to redirect it towards our older Chihuahua if he is nearby. His demeanor always goes back to normal (which is very affectionate/tolerant) after a quick separation, but. We have hired a dog trainer who has told us that this behavior is because he is scared, and that when he is burrowed up or sleeping he becomes really reactive. we are working on training methods to lesson these responses, which will hopefully calm him down enough for our cat and our elder Chihuahua\\n\\nThe 13m chihuahua is our primary concern. My wife has had him since he was a puppy, and he has always been a very snuggly and affectionate dog. After finding the younger chi the 13m Chihuahua was diagnosed with pituitary Cushing\\'s disease (which was otherwise not in full swing yet), and found to have some mass cell tumors that had to be removed (one in the center of his chest and the other on his rear leg leaving some pretty serious scars). These tumors were rated low on both of the relevant grading scales when lab work was done, and they had clean margins when removed. They also did an x-ray of his lungs, which were clear of any cancer and they did his bloodwork, which did not alert them to anything other than the Cushing\\'s. When in recovery  the younger chi because the younger would snap at our senior about once per day, and as a toothless old man, he wasn\\'t really able to defend himself. Fortunately we were able to intervene before any real conflict broke out. The 13m Chi had to get stitches removed 2 weeks post-op and did not take the experience well by yelling and howling throughout the whole process (he turned 13 the day after). Now, six weeks post-op and four weeks post stitch removal, our once very affectionate and physical chi is acting totally different.  The combination of the new stressful younger chi puppy, medical scares for the older chi, and a recent tragic loss of a friend, has caused an overall very anxious and sad vibe in our home since the beginning of October, which I fear is exacerbating these problems.\\n\\nWhat was once a very snuggly, kissy, and physically affectionate dog has gotten very touch sensitive and will yelp, growl, and retreat just a few feet away when we attempt to touch.  This behavior is more pronounced in the evening, which is unfortunate, because this is when my wife gets home and she is unable to love her baby boy.  He will stand a few feet away from us, and just growl lowly, tail wagging. He will then hop up and beg to be held, only by me at this point, where he can be touched and pet as normal (he will also give kisses). If we are on the couch, he will sit in physical contact with us (either next to us or on top of us directly) but any attempt to touch him with our hands is met with the response mentioned above. We brought him to our vet, who did a routine physical, and ruled out any obvious physical pain through applying pressure to his body and joint manipulation. He had been in surgery recently, and so they had a fairly recent physical and bloodwork for him, and we had just dropped off a stool sample with no red flags. She also ruled out any cataract caused blindness and hearing loss. She prescribed Senilife, which he has been on a little less than 2 weeks, to help with any potential cognitive decline, and she also prescribed painkillers in case any residual pain from the surgery was causing this behavior. He was only on the painkillers for a few days, before she took him off of them to see if there was any change. I was out of town at this time, and my wife was their primary caretaker. During this week of my absence, she said that he was feeling and acting a lot better. When I came back from my trip, he started acting up again. Our vet told us not to start him back on the painkillers, but encouraged us to provide chewable CBD tablets (5mg / day) and Melatonin in the evening. With another week of no visible improvement, she has now prescribed Gabapentin in the evenings, which we started yesterday. As of now, he has not been on any of these supplements or medications for more than 2 weeks. Maybe we need to stick with the routine a little longer to begin seeing results?\\n\\nHe is still excited for food and has a healthy appetite, very alert, and has a good trotting when he is on his many daily walks (he is enthusiastic when we put on his harness, no touch sensitivity at all). He doesn\\'t play as much with the new puppy as he did when they first were introduced, but I attribute that to the age difference, the surgery, and any residual pain he might be in. He does get very short tempered when the puppy wants to play with him, but they sleep next to each other all day by my feet when I am working with no incident.  I had a dog with CCD before, and she was not acting like this when she succumbed, but maybe this is early stages? He doesn\\'t get stuck behind things. At night he has some trouble using his doggy steps (which he was normally very proficient in) but that has been occurring ever since the new dog was introduced, and there was a lot of early nighttime conflict on the steps between the two. Throughout the day he manages to use them fine. He will sleep cuddled in my wife\\'s arms the whole night, occasionally waking up and going to the bathroom, or he will get up and growl at us from the bed (perhaps at the puppy?). He will then come back to his spot in her arms when asked. He has always been trained to use an indoor pee-pad for all of his bathroom needs and he is consistent in using them (when I don\\'t take them out). I filled out a CCDR evaluation, and depending on how I interpreted some of his recent behaviors, he was either not suffering from CCD, or in the \"At Risk\" bracket. I have one of those cross body dog carry bags, and when he is it he is as snuggly and calm as he has always been. He is more tolerant of my contact then of my wife.\\n\\nFor our older Chihuahua we mainly have the following concerns:\\n\\n1. He is in still in some form of pain from the surgery or from another source.\\n\\n2. He has developed touch sensitivity as a result from the trauma of the last few weeks of surgery and overall environment of our house. We hope that this can be modified or will lessen with training / time / pharmaceutical intervention.\\n\\n3. He is exhibiting symptoms of CCD and we will need to start some kind of treatment. I\\'ve heard positive things about \"herbal\" oil, as well as Senilife. I have read that Anipryl (Selegiline) is the only FDA approved medication for CCD treatment as well as Cushings. \\n\\n4. Some combination of the above.\\n\\nLooking for any advice or anecdotes. Part of me knows that the treatments he is on have just started, and they will take time. But I also try and practice \"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.\". We just want to have our sweet old dog back to normal, or at the very least comfortable and at ease.

Each time these bites happen if he is disturbed when resting or woken up. We will also have to hold him back because he has a tendency to redirect it towards our older Chihuahua if he is nearby. His demeanor always goes back to normal (which is very affectionate/tolerant) after a quick separation, but. We have hired a dog trainer who has told us that this behavior is because he is scared, and that when he is burrowed up or sleeping he becomes really reactive. we are working on training methods to lesson these responses, which will hopefully calm him down enough for our cat and our elder Chihuahua\\n\\nThe 13m chihuahua is our primary concern. My wife has had him since he was a puppy, and he has always been a very snuggly and affectionate dog. After finding the younger chi the 13m Chihuahua was diagnosed with pituitary Cushing\\'s disease (which was otherwise not in full swing yet), and found to have some mass cell tumors that had to be removed (one in the center of his chest and the other on his rear leg leaving some pretty serious scars). These tumors were rated low on both of the relevant grading scales when lab work was done, and they had clean margins when removed. They also did an x-ray of his lungs, which were clear of any cancer and they did his bloodwork, which did not alert them to anything other than the Cushing\\'s. When in recovery  the younger chi because the younger would snap at our senior about once per day, and as a toothless old man, he wasn\\'t really able to defend himself. Fortunately we were able to intervene before any real conflict broke out. The 13m Chi had to get stitches removed 2 weeks post-op and did not take the experience well by yelling and howling throughout the whole process (he turned 13 the day after). Now, six weeks post-op and four weeks post stitch removal, our once very affectionate and physical chi is acting totally different.  The combination of the new stressful younger chi puppy, medical scares for the older chi, and a recent tragic loss of a friend, has caused an overall very anxious and sad vibe in our home since the beginning of October, which I fear is exacerbating these problems.\\n\\nWhat was once a very snuggly, kissy, and physically affectionate dog has gotten very touch sensitive and will yelp, growl, and retreat just a few feet away when we attempt to touch.  This behavior is more pronounced in the evening, which is unfortunate, because this is when my wife gets home and she is unable to love her baby boy.  He will stand a few feet away from us, and just growl lowly, tail wagging. He will then hop up and beg to be held, only by me at this point, where he can be touched and pet as normal (he will also give kisses). If we are on the couch, he will sit in physical contact with us (either next to us or on top of us directly) but any attempt to touch him with our hands is met with the response mentioned above. We brought him to our vet, who did a routine physical, and ruled out any obvious physical pain through applying pressure to his body and joint manipulation. He had been in surgery recently, and so they had a fairly recent physical and bloodwork for him, and we had just dropped off a stool sample with no red flags. She also ruled out any cataract caused blindness and hearing loss. She prescribed Senilife, which he has been on a little less than 2 weeks, to help with any potential cognitive decline, and she also prescribed painkillers in case any residual pain from the surgery was causing this behavior. He was only on the painkillers for a few days, before she took him off of them to see if there was any change. I was out of town at this time, and my wife was their primary caretaker. During this week of my absence, she said that he was feeling and acting a lot better. When I came back from my trip, he started acting up again. Our vet told us not to start him back on the painkillers, but encouraged us to provide chewable CBD tablets (5mg / day) and Melatonin in the evening. With another week of no visible improvement, she has now prescribed Gabapentin in the evenings, which we started yesterday. As of now, he has not been on any of these supplements or medications for more than 2 weeks. Maybe we need to stick with the routine a little longer to begin seeing results?\\n\\nHe is still excited for food and has a healthy appetite, very alert, and has a good trotting when he is on his many daily walks (he is enthusiastic when we put on his harness, no touch sensitivity at all). He doesn\\'t play as much with the new puppy as he did when they first were introduced, but I attribute that to the age difference, the surgery, and any residual pain he might be in. He does get very short tempered when the puppy wants to play with him, but they sleep next to each other all day by my feet when I am working with no incident.  I had a dog with CCD before, and she was not acting like this when she succumbed, but maybe this is early stages? He doesn\\'t get stuck behind things. At night he has some trouble using his doggy steps (which he was normally very proficient in) but that has been occurring ever since the new dog was introduced, and there was a lot of early nighttime conflict on the steps between the two. Throughout the day he manages to use them fine. He will sleep cuddled in my wife\\'s arms the whole night, occasionally waking up and going to the bathroom, or he will get up and growl at us from the bed (perhaps at the puppy?). He will then come back to his spot in her arms when asked. He has always been trained to use an indoor pee-pad for all of his bathroom needs and he is consistent in using them (when I don\\'t take them out). I filled out a CCDR evaluation, and depending on how I interpreted some of his recent behaviors, he was either not suffering from CCD, or in the \"At Risk\" bracket. I have one of those cross body dog carry bags, and when he is it he is as snuggly and calm as he has always been. He is more tolerant of my contact then of my wife.\\n\\nFor our older Chihuahua we mainly have the following concerns:\\n\\n1. He is in still in some form of pain from the surgery or from another source.\\n\\n2. He has developed touch sensitivity as a result from the trauma of the last few weeks of surgery and overall environment of our house. We hope that this can be modified or will lessen with training / time / pharmaceutical intervention.\\n\\n3. He is exhibiting symptoms of CCD and we will need to start some kind of treatment. I\\'ve heard positive things about \"herbal\" oil, as well as Senilife. I have read that Anipryl (Selegiline) is the only FDA approved medication for CCD treatment as well as Cushings. \\n\\n4. Some combination of the above.\\n\\nLooking for any advice or anecdotes. Part of me knows that the treatments he is on have just started, and they will take time. But I also try and practice \"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.\". We just want to have our sweet old dog back to normal, or at the very least comfortable and at ease.  I have done a QoL evaluation, and he seems to be still very much in the healthy range. We hope that with a few weeks of treatment and training, this behavior will subside.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/17wyccy/pain_ptsd_or_ccd_for_a_13_year_old_chihuahua/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest.

See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly.

It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency.

I was searching for answers everywhere and could not find anything comprehensive. Even our vet wasn\\'t sure what was happening with our dog or what to suggest. Of course, what works for our dog may not work for everyone but it may give you some hope!\\n\\nWe have a 15 yo lab mix who started having incontinence issues approximately seven months ago. Shortly thereafter she started hanging out in odd places (like under the dining room table in another room when she\\'s usually wherever we are), climbing on furniture (think: standing on top of the dining room table which she had NEVER done before), panting/pacing constantly (would lay down and immediately get back up), climbing into the tub while we were showering and standing under the water (a dog who hates baths), and just would not settle down, day or night. We took her to the vet who suspected separation anxiety.\\n\\nAt first we first tried CBD supplements recommended by our vet which did nothing. We tried another brand of CBD - nothing. We also tried the Thunder Shirt, Thunderwunders, calming music, leaving the tv on, putting something with our scent on her bed...nothing helped. \\n\\nSix months ago we started her on ??mg Prozac (sorry, cannot find the records) and 100mg Trazodone which may have helped a little at first but then did nothing. We were getting frustrated, not sleeping due to her being up all night and were concerned about her quality of life. We\\'d have to put her on a leash just so we could sit down to eat dinner because we feared her climbing/falling off something and injuring herself. We considered it may be the end for her.\\n\\nAfter a lot of research I found out about Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and subsequently Anipryl,  which is apparently the only medicine prescribed specifically for Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. Even our vets were not very familiar with Anipryl, but said they would prescribe it if we wanted to try it. After a daunting withdrawal from the Prozac (we learned after having our vet contact the manufacturer that she needed to be off the Prozac *14 days* before starting the Anipryl; our vet initially suggested 2 days which just shows how little they knew - it could have killed her), we started her on 15 mg Anipryl during the day and switched the Trazodone for .5 mg Alprazolam/5 mg Melatonin at night. **This combination made a world of difference.**\\n\\nNot to be dramatic, but it almost feels like we have our old dog back. She is no longer climbing on furniture, panting/pacing throughout the day. She does have an occasional \"episode\" but they are rare and short lived. She still gets up in the night and will dig in her bed, but she will eventually settle and sleep. We also have her in diapers for the incontinence issue and these have been life-changing as well. THEY WORK. Sometimes we\\'ll double them up (like at night) and put a washable diaper on top so she can\\'t wiggle out of them, but it saves us from having to wash her bed, and it saves our floors & furniture. FWIW she is also on estrogen but it does not prevent her from peeing inside (another thing she\\'d never done before). \\n\\nIt has been about seven months since she started exhibiting symptoms and she is doing so much better now. Aside from the CCD she is in great health; even if it only affords us a few more months with her, we are so happy to have found this protocol that works for us.\\n\\nI just wanted to share in case anyone is having similar issues and is not sure what to do. Sadly we had to do most of the research/legwork ourselves because our vets were just not educated about this disease and how to treat it.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/xw9wtx/canine_cognitive_dysfunction_whats_working_for_us/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 2, 'content': 'Our Springer Spaniel\\'s compulsive disorder is worsening. I would love any experiences you can share about training dogs with this condition as well as tips on exercising your dog on leash and running with your dog.\\nWe got our Springer Spaniel when he was a year and 2 months and have now had him for seven months. We didn\\'t know about his condition before we adopted him. We live in an apartment but have a large park nearby that we walk him in for at least 1.5 hours a day. We also used to do gun dog training there until his condition no longer allowed the required focus. His leash walking was terrible when he first got here and we have managed to improve it a lot, however he still lounges at birds and as his condition is deteriorating so his his leash walking. We take him out for a half hour leash walk a day to practice. My boyfriends previous dog was a field trial champion gun dog and we currently have a wonderful cocker spaniel bitch that we also do gun dog training with so we are by no means inexperienced dog owners.\\n\\nHis compulsive behavior is staring at walls and panting indoors even when there are no shadows to chase and outside he has outbursts of chasing either the shadow of his own ears or nothing at all. It makes it impossible to get reliable recall. We try to interrupt this behavior at all times. My boyfriend works from home and I study online so we are around most of the time. Inside this is very annoying and disruptive to anything we may be doing as he will randomly jump up and stare at the wall  but it is possible. I am currently trialling tethering him to me (attaching the leash to my waist) so I can get some work done and it seems to be working ok. Outside we have tried managing him with a long leash, however he is very fast and if he manages to slip away he gets tangled in the trees and gets very distressed and over threshold. His condition is continuously worsening. I don\\'t know for how much longer we can keep trying. I am exhausted and feel like crying after every walk.\\n\\nWe have gotten help from a behaviourist. He said we were likely overtraining him with the gun dog training which was making him stressed out and increasing his obsessive behavior so we cut this out. He also said we should try to make every walk a \"good walk\" without him freaking out. As his chasing behavior outside has gotten worse we have had to restrict him to on leash walking to manage his condition as well as fetch and recall training in our buildings tiny fenced dog park. This doesn\\'t seem like nearly enough exercise for a springer spaniel and the pulling that still occurs of walks is causing me constant shoulder pain. I am afraid lack of exercise will worsen his condition. I am trying to fit in training sessions on settle and renew his recall training indoors and in the dog park. If I can get his leash walking a bit better I may be able to take him to walk in the park instead of by the road so nature doesn\\'t become even more exciting. I would also love to take him running. However, I am not sure how to get him to not pull without having to correct all the time. Also, running seems to excite him and increase his pulling. We are currently trying him on mementadine but it doesn\\'t seem to be working. The next step will be selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors. However our behaviourist wants to do neurological tests, orthopaedic exams of his legs and eye tests before we can try them which will take months. I don\\'t know if I can hold on for that long. The insurance is treating this as a pre-existing condition and isn\\'t paying so all these tests will cost us thousands of pounds. He is also really afraid of the vets at this point because we have to keep bringing him so he has special meds to take on days he has to go to the vet. However, they don\\'t seem to be working. We will try to convince them to let us try the SSRIs without all these tests.\\n\\nI am looking for any advice from people that have experience with compulsive disorders in dogs from a training or medication perspective. Does it ever get better? I am so tired. Please don\\'t bring up that \"It\\'s me or the dog!\" episode. I have seen it and I wish any of it worked for us. Any suggestions on providing sufficient exercise and mental stimulation without stressing him out would also be greatly appreciated. If you have dogs with different behavioural issues, what management techniques do you use? Also, do any of you run with your dogs on lead? How did you get them not to pull?', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/s7x8br/our_springer_spaniels_compulsive_disorder_is/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': 'Need Advice: The dogs are running our life and I see no escape\\nSo I must start by saying that this has become an emotionally overwhelming and complex issue. When I met my now husband he was living alone with his little dog. His home was tidy but smelled awful of dog pee and there were dried turds we found in the basement when we moved. His little dog is a chihuahua dachshund mix and was morbidly obese. It seemed he was loved but struggling in the behavior department and his owner was not taking the best care of him. He would leave him home alone all day which I assumed was the cause for going to the bathroom in the house because when you would let him out into the fenced yard he would do his business immediately and come in for his treat. Little guy was very fat, barked incessantly at the dog, would get the zoomies for half an hour straight when you came into the house but knew basic commands and once he calmed down would just go take a nap or chew a bone peacefully. When DH moved into my home I did not own a dog but did all I knew how to help the little dude. He went to the vet for overdue care, was put on a new food and spent a lot more time outside running and getting exercise. \\n\\nWe found that he was not going potty in the house because he wasn’t well trained but because he liked to mark. I would take him out for a long walk and he would do his business and mark outside quite a bit. Then right after coming in, I would catch him squeezing what he could out right onto my couch. He is crate trained and loves to chill in his crate so I found that he could just not be trusted to be left unsupervised and used the crate intermittently to ensure he would do as little marking as possible. I am not a fan of filth and have a daughter that I prefer to keep a clean home for. He would find opportunities like when my back was turned in the kitchen to go mark. Very frustrating because I wanted him to feel like part of the family and not be locked up all the time. \\n\\nLittle guy has an extremely loud and aggressive bark, he reacts to any sound at the door as well as imperceivable triggers. He has multiple barking episodes an hour and it takes a long time to calm him. This issue has only gotten worse over the years. He will also whine and cry out/bark in his crate for hours. You will let him out and give water and let him go to the bathroom, but all he cares about is checking to see if there’s anything on the kitchen floor and then he’s off to sniff the couch (we’ve had quite a few couches be replaced since he moved in) and lift his leg. So it’s back in the crate. He makes all this noise not just when people are in the room moving around but through the night and when no one is home. I’m not able to relax for even a second. \\n\\nAlthough he loves to spend time with me and my daughter he has bit us both multiple times in our hands and face. He will do it when we help unwrap his lead outside from around a chair leg, he will be giving kisses and suddenly bite, he will happily run in his crate when we go to leave, gently take a treat from your fingers then snap at you as you close the crate. Generally unpredictably with the exception of when he is resource guarding. He used to be allowed out at times when people were eating but just telling him to back off he would get aggressive. \\n\\nWe now have a very sweet bulldog who is 2.5. We got her as a puppy and up until 6 month’s ago, her and little guy were besties. He began snapping at her, biting her to resource guard and just doing all he could to maintain dominance over the situation. The problem is that he is 13lbs and she is 57lbs. So one day it became an altercation. She was not going to tolerate being attacked for wanting to be in the same room as him and the people he wanted to hang out with. She tackled him to the ground and pinned him. She did not hurt him, or try to bite but he screamed bloody murder and was doing all he could to bite her. I reached in to pull them apart and got bit to the point of needing medical care as the meat of my palm was ripped open quite deeply.  The dogs have not been able to be in the same room together since. They remain crated and switched out through the day. \\n\\nAfter a couple of years he is at a very healthy weight and maintaining it. He has routine vet care and we’ve asked if he is in any pain as he is now an older dog. He is perfectly healthy and his issues seem to be completely behavioral. After the big fight, we discussed the issues with our vet and she suggested he be put down. We opted to try Prozac which he has been on for 4 months now. We’ve seen no difference. We’ve also contacted three different trainers who said they felt they would be unable to help due to his age. DH down plays the severity of the issues, points out everything the other dog does wrong, ignores and avoids the amount of daily effort and the stress it causes me throughout each day. He absolutely will not hear of rehousing the dog and it would break my heart to have him put down even if this is what the vet suggested.I am now 7 months pregnant and the stress of dealing with this dog is really putting me over the edge. I am not looking forward to him waking the baby up and later having to navigate keeping him away from the baby for fear of biting, as well as not allowing him near baby’s things as he may try to pee on them. \\n\\nOut of stubbornness of my husband I am left to handle full time work, carrying and later caring for the little one, maintaining the home and dealing with the constant chaos that is coordinating/mitigating dog issues.

He has also become food obsessed and is starting to bite. I’ve had him for most of his life and neither of these is a big deal to me aside from sleeping arrangements because he goes through phases where he *won’t lay down without me laying next to him and even then often wants to get up in the night.*   \\n\\n\\nTaken him to three different vets and had X-rays and other scans and he seems in excellent physical health; his teeth aren’t optimal but so far we haven’t had any major issues. He tends to wander and cry a lot… I was worried he’s in pain from arthritis but even with medication (CBD and an NSAID) the symptoms haven’t changed. He was having seizures for a bit but the CBD seems to have solved a lot and he’s going on two months seizure free. Deafness and blindness are creeping in but I've had older and more disabled dogs and this is different.  \\n\\n\\nHe sleeps with me every night and I have to let him up and down a lot; it’s inconvenient but I adore him as does my girlfriend so this is really just about him. He stopped responding to his name or any cue commands like snapping or clapping(he was never great at these anyways) over a year or two ago. He uses a pee pad in the house to go but has started doing weird things like pooping in the kitchen or dragging his refuse places. If we try and walk him with the other dog it's impossibly slow and if we let him out into the field we have he just stands there, yet sometimes he will get crazed and start darting around the apartment like he's looking for something and get very active. He has no interest in toys and never has, never really engaged in play with other dogs.  \\n\\n\\n**TL:DR I guess I'm just looking for perspective and advice on this stage from similar dog friends and what the outlook is; I've had old dogs before and the physical side always came into play first. We have some options for local play dates and maybe could try walking him more? He's in such good physical health and ability.... I don't want my guy to suffer and be sad.**\\n\\nEDIT: I have another dog, half Pit/Irish wolfhound named Obi. They get along together even though Obi gets along with almost no one, because Obi grew up with him from a pup; that’s the other dog, he’s half his age and much more active. Never fixed.

TL;DR at end. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads and/or comments. Formatted on mobile. I tried to organize it in a way that makes sense. \\n\\nPicture of my dog and 19 pictures of some (not all) of the damage he’s done when left alone in the last three months [can be found here](https://imgur.com/a/ViQUkWG). Warning, there are some light bloodstains in some pictures. \\n\\n# General Background\\n\\n* My dog Khan is about 10 or 11 years old, he weighs 60lbs, and he is very loved. I adopted him a little over 4.5 years ago. The shelter said he was a black mouth mountain cur, but he’s probably mixed. All I know about his past is he was shipped up from the south like many dogs are to avoid kill shelters, and a woman had him for a month before me but gave him back because he was too clingy. \\n\\n* Khan has always been clingy, but in the past three months his separation anxiety has become very severe and keeps escalating. I’ve brought him to the vet (bloodwork was fine) and consulted with a separation anxiety behaviorist, and they both think in addition to the separation anxiety he is also suffering from canine cognitive dysfunction (dog dementia). He seems physically fine, and he has a cushioned step for my bed in case he is hiding joint pain, which he uses sometimes. He is on Prozac and Valium, details can be found below. \\n\\n* For years he was totally fine being left alone even though he was clingy. He always had free range, he’s not a crate dog. The vet and behaviorist both said a crate would make him suffer even more and I agree. \\n\\n* We live in an apartment in a city right next to a huge park and a huge dog park. My room is also pretty big. He goes to the park twice a day and goes out once more at night. When I\\'m at work he has a dogwalker who he loves. \\n\\n* We also live with a roommate who he is very bonded to, he used to sleep with her instead of me every night (heartbreaking!) until the dementia set in and she couldn\\'t handle him waking her up, now she shuts him out of her room at all times which I think stresses him out more. This all started after she went on vacation one week a month for about three months but didn\\'t stop when she came back, she\\'s been home for three months now. But she is going to be gone three weeks next month and that means he\\'s going to freak out even more than he has been the past three months when she was home. The other night she told me I should consider putting him to sleep which shocked me. Then she suggested I give him away which also shocked me. It would be so cruel to abandon a dog with abandonment issues, and I doubt anyone else would do as much as I am to help him. I love him so much, I thought she did too. I think the apartment damage is really stressing her out but I\\'m going to pay to fix it. We\\'re friends but the whole situation is becoming a source of tension. My family and co-workers also think it\\'s time. \\n\\n* For three years we lived with my exSO who he was very bonded with, but he handled the transition when we moved about 10 months ago way better than I expected. They still see each other about once a month. He frequently travels out of state for work though so he can\\'t really help out a lot. \\n\\n* Whoever trained him did a great job, I worry they were strict though because he isn’t very playful. He likes to chew on antlers and ostrich knuckles and plays with a frozen treat Kong but only for a little bit and only if we are home, he won\\'t touch them if we\\'re gone. He never destroyed anything in the past. I could leave a steak on the floor and tell him not to touch it and leave the apartment and he wouldn’t. So what I’m about to describe is very out of character. We eventually decided to get a tall thick metal gate to keep him in my room because he was so destructive to the apartment and my roommate\\'s things.\\n\\n* I work full time, but in four days (have a dogwalker as mentioned above). So three days of the week I\\'m home all day with him, I don\\'t go out and don\\'t have anyone over because that stresses him out too. Sometimes I have errands or appointments and have to leave a little bit. I used to practice leaving in short increments to desensitize him before I was told by a behaviorist that was futile because of the severity of anxiety, more details on that below. I have to practically wrestle him into my gated room before I leave, he really resists it. If I could work from home I would. \\n\\n# Symptoms\\n\\n### Separation Anxiety\\n\\n* I want to preface this by saying I value him way above the damage he has caused, and I do not punish him for it. In the past three months he has clawed/chewed up six door frames, six doors, a windowsill, a tall teal standing cabinet (and knocked it over and shredded the shreddable contents twice), a dresser, a vanity, a laundry basket, a chair, part of a vacuum cleaner, two thick metal bars from a gate, etc. I leave cardboard for him and he\\'ll chew that but it doesn\\'t prevent him from scratching up wood. I\\'m really worried he\\'s going to hurt himself, so far he\\'s split a few nails and when he ripped the bars off the gate there was blood. He also pushed my vanity into my room and the legs are unstable, so for weeks all my furniture has been clumped in a corner surrounded by barriers so he cant move it, but he still finds ways to chew and scratch it. \\n\\n* He never has accidents, but gets terrified when I take him out to pee at night and he usually refuses and drags me back to the stoop. In the daytime he doesn\\'t pee on multiple things on our walks like he used to, just pees once. He won\\'t eat or drink or play with his toys when we\\'re gone. When he panics he pants and individual drops of drool fall, by the time I get home there\\'s a huge puddle by the gate. I\\'ve filmed him before and the destruction starts as soon as I leave. Some days the Valium works better than other days and he barely destroys anything. \\n\\n* He also is not as interested in food and only eats a little bit at a time, instead of excitedly wolfing it down. He usually still likes treats though, unless he is panicking, then he refuses to eat anything. As I mentioned before he will not eat or drink alone. \\n\\n### Dementia\\n\\n* The reason he also was diagnosed with dementia is sometimes he\\'ll just stare off into space in the middle of the room and he\\'ll try to go into a different apartment than ours after walks and he panics even when I\\'m home (but is only destructive when alone), and he gets worse at night. He forgets his \"sit\" command unless the Valium works better than usual, things like that. \\n\\n* At nighttime he frequently wakes me up panicking. At his worst he\\'ll wake me up every 20 minutes, pretty much as soon as I fall back asleep. If I\\'m lucky and the Valium works better than usual it happens in two hour increments. He will be shaking and panting and have a crazy look in his eye, and he\\'ll jam his nose in my eye socket and thrust his head upward, or sit on my face or chest or step on my long hair and rip it out or straddle my chest and refuse to move trapping me, etc. I used to try taking him outside but he doesn\\'t have to pee because he just panics there too, like I described earlier. \\n\\n# Medication\\n\\n* He has been on Prozac titrating up for two months, he’s been on 60mg for about two weeks. He also gets a total of 30mg of Valium a day, split into two doses for when I’m at work and nighttime. In the past we tried Xanax and Trazodone but neither helped. He also gets strong strength dog CBD everyday. \\n\\n* The Prozac/Valium/CBD is helping a little, but not that much, and it’s clear he’s going to keep getting worse. Last time I talked to my vet she said she was out of ideas for medication but I’ll reach out to her again. I was told to see a board certified vet behaviorist, essentially a vet psychiatrist, because they have more training in the nuances of brain medication, but there are very few in the country and I was quoted $900 for a consultation which unfortunately I can’t afford. I was also told by the separation anxiety specialist that we can’t work on training him unless the medication worked because when dogs are too anxious their brains can’t create memories necessary for training. \\n\\n# Other Things I\\'ve Tried\\n\\nThings I\\'ve tried (open to ideas if you have them): \\n* Taping cardboard over the door, thick gaffe and duct tape over the door, taping a towel over the door, putting a vacuum in the way, doing a lemon/vinegar rub (this worked but caused him to move onto furniture). \\n* Various types of calming treats and a calming pheromone scent. \\n* Medication described above. \\n* Extra exercise and longs walks.\\n* Leaving a fan, lights, Bob Ross, and calming dog music playlist or long audiobook on. Leaving a frozen Kong which he won\\'t touch anymore.\\n* Thundershirt. \\n* My ex took him for three days so I could paint my dark navy room a light color which I thought might help with the nighttime anxiety but it hasn\\'t. I also spackled and painted over some of the damage but his first day back he tore the door frame up again. \\n* Getting ready to leave but sitting around, leaving in seconds to minutes increasing increments, not acknowledging or making a big deal about coming home or leaving.\\n\\n# Other Factors\\n\\n* I try really hard to be patient with him at night but the sleep deprivation is taking a toll. Unfortunately when I get woken up repeatedly I sometimes lose control of my mood and react before thinking and get frustrated with him and push him away or yell, then I feel so guilty because I know it\\'s not his fault and getting frustrated makes it worse. Full disclosure I have bipolar disorder and anxiety, I\\'m well medicated and have been for years but can\\'t take my insomnia medication anymore because him waking me up on it would make me hallucinate. \\n\\n* I\\'m trying to keep the effects on all of this on me out of my decision about when it\\'s time to let go, even though it is taking a financial (vet bills, apartment repairs, various potential remedies, etc), physical, and mental toll. The decision when/if to let go will be made with his quality of life in mind first and foremost. I just don\\'t know though. I feel bad because I know how panic attacks feel and I don\\'t know if it\\'s cruel to keep him alive when he experiences them so frequently and for so long. He is also terrified of thunderstorms and fireworks, and doesn\\'t handle heat well (for example frantically digs holes to lay in and cool down during walks despite drinking lots of water) and it\\'s getting to be that time of the year. My roommate also just dropped the bombshell that she wants to terminate the lease this September 2019 instead of 2020 like we planned, and I don\\'t think he can handle another move. I love him so much. He\\'s definitely suffering but has good moments sometimes, but the bad times are bad. He isn\\'t the dog he used to be, and I know the prognosis is his brain will keep deteriorating. \\n\\nTL;DR My senior dog has severe separation anxiety and dementia and is not responding to medication. He is physically fine, I don\\'t know when/if his mental suffering is too cruel for him to endure.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/bg810v/help_i_dont_know_whenif_its_time_to_let_go_of_my/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': \"I need help with a dog who has an extremely high prey drive with a major lack of impulse control\\nFor starters, I am a dog trainer. I've been in the field for nearly 10 years and have never seen a dog quite like this one. Gir, is a frenchie/pit mix who is roughly 9m old. He has come such a long way when it comes to walking on leash, leave it, waiting at doors, focus work, etc. so he has definitely shown some improvement in his impulse control. The problem comes in when the kids have any kind of balls on the trampoline. On leash, he will easily leave them alone and not try to get them. Full slack and waiting patiently. Off leash, is a completely different story. He will jump underneath the trampoline and pop the ball into the air continuously until we are finally able to pull him away. He will not stop on his own and can get snappy when you are trying to get him to come out because he is in a heightened state of arousal or over stimulated. When I can finally get him out, he will have abrasions on his nose, cuts on his tongue, and he will easily walk away and drop into a down because he's beyond exhausted. I've talked to a vet who doesn't think it's any form of OCD or CCD. I'm pretty sure the reason why he is doing it is because he essentially can't fulfill his need to catch the ball, each time he goes for it, it pops and goes to a new spot, thus restarting the cycle. I can't figure out what I can do to help work with him more than he has already learned. I even had him on a 20ft leash and he was great, wouldn't even try, but the second the leash is off, he is 100% unreliable in any kind of recall or leave it. \\n\\nWe've done hand targeting to help his recall, we've done Leave It extensively on and off leash and he is around 90% reliable outside of this situation. He understands his cues for going inside, to settle, and so on, but I have hit a wall with this one. I would love any recommendations you can give, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels trying to figure this out and I don't have any other trainers in the area to brainstorm with. \\n\\nTLDR: Dog has a high prey drive when it can't fulfill it's need to catch the prey, outside of that is strongly reliable in other commands on and off leash.

After finding the younger chi the 13m Chihuahua was diagnosed with pituitary Cushing\\'s disease (which was otherwise not in full swing yet), and found to have some mass cell tumors that had to be removed (one in the center of his chest and the other on his rear leg leaving some pretty serious scars). These tumors were rated low on both of the relevant grading scales when lab work was done, and they had clean margins when removed. They also did an x-ray of his lungs, which were clear of any cancer and they did his bloodwork, which did not alert them to anything other than the Cushing\\'s. When in recovery  the younger chi because the younger would snap at our senior about once per day, and as a toothless old man, he wasn\\'t really able to defend himself. Fortunately we were able to intervene before any real conflict broke out. The 13m Chi had to get stitches removed 2 weeks post-op and did not take the experience well by yelling and howling throughout the whole process (he turned 13 the day after). Now, six weeks post-op and four weeks post stitch removal, our once very affectionate and physical chi is acting totally different.  The combination of the new stressful younger chi puppy, medical scares for the older chi, and a recent tragic loss of a friend, has caused an overall very anxious and sad vibe in our home since the beginning of October, which I fear is exacerbating these problems.\\n\\nWhat was once a very snuggly, kissy, and physically affectionate dog has gotten very touch sensitive and will yelp, growl, and retreat just a few feet away when we attempt to touch.  This behavior is more pronounced in the evening, which is unfortunate, because this is when my wife gets home and she is unable to love her baby boy.  He will stand a few feet away from us, and just growl lowly, tail wagging. He will then hop up and beg to be held, only by me at this point, where he can be touched and pet as normal (he will also give kisses). If we are on the couch, he will sit in physical contact with us (either next to us or on top of us directly) but any attempt to touch him with our hands is met with the response mentioned above. We brought him to our vet, who did a routine physical, and ruled out any obvious physical pain through applying pressure to his body and joint manipulation. He had been in surgery recently, and so they had a fairly recent physical and bloodwork for him, and we had just dropped off a stool sample with no red flags. She also ruled out any cataract caused blindness and hearing loss. She prescribed Senilife, which he has been on a little less than 2 weeks, to help with any potential cognitive decline, and she also prescribed painkillers in case any residual pain from the surgery was causing this behavior. He was only on the painkillers for a few days, before she took him off of them to see if there was any change. I was out of town at this time, and my wife was their primary caretaker. During this week of my absence, she said that he was feeling and acting a lot better. When I came back from my trip, he started acting up again. Our vet told us not to start him back on the painkillers, but encouraged us to provide chewable CBD tablets (5mg / day) and Melatonin in the evening. With another week of no visible improvement, she has now prescribed Gabapentin in the evenings, which we started yesterday. As of now, he has not been on any of these supplements or medications for more than 2 weeks. Maybe we need to stick with the routine a little longer to begin seeing results?\\n\\nHe is still excited for food and has a healthy appetite, very alert, and has a good trotting when he is on his many daily walks (he is enthusiastic when we put on his harness, no touch sensitivity at all). He doesn\\'t play as much with the new puppy as he did when they first were introduced, but I attribute that to the age difference, the surgery, and any residual pain he might be in. He does get very short tempered when the puppy wants to play with him, but they sleep next to each other all day by my feet when I am working with no incident.  I had a dog with CCD before, and she was not acting like this when she succumbed, but maybe this is early stages? He doesn\\'t get stuck behind things. At night he has some trouble using his doggy steps (which he was normally very proficient in) but that has been occurring ever since the new dog was introduced, and there was a lot of early nighttime conflict on the steps between the two. Throughout the day he manages to use them fine. He will sleep cuddled in my wife\\'s arms the whole night, occasionally waking up and going to the bathroom, or he will get up and growl at us from the bed (perhaps at the puppy?). He will then come back to his spot in her arms when asked. He has always been trained to use an indoor pee-pad for all of his bathroom needs and he is consistent in using them (when I don\\'t take them out). I filled out a CCDR evaluation, and depending on how I interpreted some of his recent behaviors, he was either not suffering from CCD, or in the \"At Risk\" bracket. I have one of those cross body dog carry bags, and when he is it he is as snuggly and calm as he has always been. He is more tolerant of my contact then of my wife.\\n\\nFor our older Chihuahua we mainly have the following concerns:\\n\\n1. He is in still in some form of pain from the surgery or from another source.\\n\\n2. He has developed touch sensitivity as a result from the trauma of the last few weeks of surgery and overall environment of our house. We hope that this can be modified or will lessen with training / time / pharmaceutical intervention.\\n\\n3. He is exhibiting symptoms of CCD and we will need to start some kind of treatment. I\\'ve heard positive things about \"herbal\" oil, as well as Senilife. I have read that Anipryl (Selegiline) is the only FDA approved medication for CCD treatment as well as Cushings. \\n\\n4. Some combination of the above.\\n\\nLooking for any advice or anecdotes. Part of me knows that the treatments he is on have just started, and they will take time.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life.

We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}]\n",

If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**\\n\\n*No, I have owned a Cane Corso, American Pitbull Terrier and a GSD Mix. All of my dogs were trained in basic obedience (Sit, Stay, Down, Recall, loose lead walking)*\\n\\n**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**\\n\\n*I just lost my Cane Corse to Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and my APBT to bone cancer within a year of each other. They were 10 and 9, respectively. So, I'll be going the reputable breeder route to minimize any health issues moving forward.*\\n\\n**Describe your ideal dog.**\\n\\n*My dream dog is medium - X- Large, minimal-moderate shedding, easily trainable, happy on a hike or in the house for a movie night. They will accompany me almost everywhere, other than work.*\\n\\n**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**\\n\\n*My dream breed is a Dutch Shepherd, they are the most beautiful breed I've ever seen. Unfortunately, my research has built up some fear of not being able to sufficiently meet the breeds physical exercise requirements, (From my understanding, they are like Malinois level energizer bunnies that just go and go) and I've also read that they do not enjoy cuddling after a days work, which is something I absolutely need in a breed lol.*\\n\\n*This has led me to lean towards the GSD breed. I do not particularly like the look of the showline GSD, but their temperament and exercise requirements seem to be exactly what I need. I LOVE the look of the dark sable working line shepherds, with the more square structure and healthier hips / elbows, but I have the same hesitations that come with the Dutch Shepherds regarding the 23.5hrs a day of exercise required to make them happy lol.*\\n\\n*I also feel like the Doberman could be ideal for me, but their breed-specific health issues seem way too common. Kind of scares me, do NOT want another dog to get sick on me.*\\n\\n**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**\\n\\n*Advanced Obedience (Strict heel, down, stay, sit, place, recall, off-lead obedience for hikes), I will be putting a TON of time and energy into the socialization of my pup so he can go to lots of places with me and be comfortable and happy, and, potentially some bite and scent work training that could translate into IPO-style dog sports for fun.*\\n\\n**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**\\n\\n*This is a possibilty down the road when I think he's bored with our normal training routines. I have 0 experience in this field, however.*\\n\\nCare Commitments\\n\\n**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**\\n\\n*I will be doing about 30-60 mins of obedience training, 60-90mins of physcial play, 2-3 walks about 2 miles each, and as much socialization I can each day. At home, my family will be interacting with him nonstop (light play indoors, cuddling, etc.)*\\n\\n**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**\\n\\n*an hour - hour and a half of physical exercise is a realistic number I can hit daily (more on weekends as I go for hikes or walk through state parks on saturday mornings), I also calculate mental and physical exercise as separate activities, so we will also be doing another 30/60 mins of mental exercise via obedience training and puzzles. This includes walks around the neghborhood, playing in our fenced backyard, going to any of the local parks, hiking, etc.*\\n\\n*I will NOT be using a dog park. I have seen way too many untrained dogs at dog parks that just become a danger to have around my pups. my pit was attacked at a dog park, it took me years to make her comfortable around strange dogs again. We will walk through dog parks, but we will not be going into the kennel areas and going off leash for unstructured play with strange dogs.*\\n\\n**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**\\n\\n*I'd prefer a brushing once or twice a week, cleaning ears is fine with me, but I do not want to have to pay a groomer for constant haircuts.*\\n\\nPersonal Preferences\\n\\n**10) What size dog are you looking for?**\\n\\n*Medium to large but Extra Large is also fine with me.*\\n\\n**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**\\n\\n*My Cane Corso slobbered me out, I am now looking for as little drool as I can get while maintaining some of the traits I need. He will be my going everywhere he’s allowed to with me, so slobbering can make people uncomfortable in public or at BBQ's or something lol.*\\n\\n**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**\\n\\n*I would love to be able to keep my dog off-lead whenever it is safe to do so. I'd say very important.*\\n\\nDog Personality and Behavior\\n\\n**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**\\n\\n*I actually love both of these personalities. My APBT was a snuggle bug, while my Cane Corso would get up and go lay across the room after a few minutes of petting. If I had to choose, I'd say I prefer a snuggly dog.*\\n\\n**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**\\n\\n*Eagerness to please is a necessity for my plans with my pup.*\\n\\n**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**\\n\\n*I would prefer for the dog to have guarding instincts, for sure. I have a son who plays in my yard and If a stranger enters my yard, they should know IMMEDIATELY  that they are not welcome. (My Corso was EXCEPTIONAL at this, while my Pit just wanted to love on everyone she saw lol). Knocking on my door -- I'd prefer an alert bark. The dog will be put into a place while I answer the door.*\\n\\n**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**\\n\\n*I hope, with the amount of socialization I'd be working on through puppyhood, that this wouldn't be an issue but, if it was, I would absolutely put the work in to fix this behaviour.*\\n\\n**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**\\n\\n*The way people talk about Huskies just bolting over fences or out of doors because they want to roam seems like an absolute nightmare. Insanely high prey drive is also something I'd like to avoid, as I live in an area that has a LOT of rabbits and small dogs walking around with their owners.*\\n\\nLifestyle\\n\\n**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**\\n\\n*The dog will be alone for 4-6hrs, 2-3 times a week.*\\n\\n**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**\\n\\n*Minimal-Moderate shedding, she will be prepping the dogs meals sometimes and playing / training with him often.*\\n\\n**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**\\n\\n*Unfortunately, no, not anymore.*\\n\\n**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**\\n\\n*Yes, I have a son (2 yrs old) and we spend a lot of time around family members ranging from 3 yrs old to 13 yrs old. I worked with my pit, who would get over excited when she saw my son and I am aware of the rough play risk a dog can pose. I am willing and able to work around this.*\\n\\n**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**\\n\\n*Never renting again.*\\n\\n**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**\\n\\n*I live in PA, USA, North America, Earth. No breed restrictions.*\\n\\n**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**\\n\\n*Peak Summer: \\\\\\\\\\\\~85 F, Peak winter: \\\\\\\\\\\\~30 F*\\n\\nAdditional Information and Questions\\n\\n**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**\\n\\n*I have a 2yr old son, a half acre yard surrounded by 6ft fences. There are many parks around me that are dog friendly.*\\n\\n*I have experience dealing with trouble behaviors (ex. my Cane Corso had crazy resource guarding and food aggression when we first got him).*\\n\\n*I'm looking for a dog that can go on hikes with me, but also chill at family functions for extended periods of time. I also want to be able to train to very high levels of obedience.*\\n\\n**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**\\n\\n*I feel like the working line GSD would require far too much exercise than I could realistically provide, but I have no in-person experience with them.*\\n\\n*Based on my information provided, does any one with working line GSD experience think I could provide the stimulation that would let them live a happy and fulfilled life?*\\n\\n*Is there a breed out there (that isn't a poodle) that actually fits all of the things I'm looking for?*\\n\\nThank you for reading all of this, looking forward to hearing your recommendations!\\n\\nEdit: I removed any misused terms to avoid further issues.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 0, 'content': \"My Girl (5Y) Died of Cancer 8 Months Ago—Need Help Finding a Breed that Suits Me and Info on How to Avoid Significant Health Issues.  \\nHello Everyone! I'm sorry for being another annoying breed recommendation post, but I'd really love the help of more knowledgeable people in looking on what breed fits my lifestyle and some recommendations for further research.\\n\\n  \\n**Introduction**\\n\\n1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\\n   * No. I've had dogs all my life. My girl, Bean, was the first puppy I've ever owned and trained (very successfully; she was often mistaken for a service dog due to how well she followed commands and her attention to her handler, me). However, I have lived with dogs my entire life. \\n2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a\\xa0[reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?\\n   * I've never purchased a dog and would like to rescue, but I am afraid of potential health issues  like Bean's, which is forcing me to consider purchasing a puppy from a reputable breeder with proven healthy lineages. \\n3. Describe your ideal dog.\\n   * I'd love a cuddly dog, handler-focused, clingy, and energetic but not so much as a working breed. I also LOVE dogs with goofy personalities, but that's more specific to the dog and less to a breed, I assume. \\n4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\\n   * Aesthetically, I love Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Anatolian Shepards, Rottweilers, and American Alsatians (which I recently heard are BYB dogs, which really put a damper on things, since they sounded pretty perfect to me). I just LOVE a huge dog with a big ole head and floppy ears. I also love Pitties/Bullies, but I can't really narrow it down to one specific breed, since I've only ever had pittie mix rescues. I just don't know enough about breed standards to provide a standard I'm interested in. I don't typically like curly haired breeds.\\n5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\\n   * Basic obedience and possibly dog sports, if the breed has more intense enrichment needs. This would be a companion dog, not a working dog.\\n6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\\n   * No desire/need to compete or have the dog work, but I'm willing to do anything to meet my dog's needs.\\n\\n**Care Commitments**\\n\\n7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\\n\\n   * At least an hour to two hours a day, but I was planning on leaving them at training/ doggy daycare while I work so that they get appropriate enrichment time. I enjoy training, playing, and walking with my dog and would love a dog that can both do that and also is happy to lay in bed with me on a lazy sunday. \\n\\n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?\\n\\n   * I volunteer at my local shelter and have done animal handling training, which makes me believe that dog parks are unnecessarily dangerous to dogs and can put undue stress on them because of the mixed playstyles and constant rotation of new players. I will not be doing dog parks. I like nature walks, short hikes, taking my dog out on the town (to dog-friendly areas), and I have a large backyard. I'd also walk them at least once a day on top of our outdoor time. \\n\\n9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\\n\\n   * I can groom regularly at home but am much more likely to pay a professional. My Bean was a short-haired bully mix and got groomed every 2-3 weeks. I love long-haired dogs but am afraid they'll overheat (Florida). \\n\\n**Personal Preferences**\\n\\n10) What size dog are you looking for?\\n\\n   * L-XL breeds. The bigger the better so long as their average lifespan is above 10. \\n\\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\\n\\n   * All of it. No such thing as too much from my baby. I deep clean regularly.\\n\\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\\n\\n   * Not at all. I have a fenced backyard and never let my dog off-leash in public due to danger from people or other dogs' behavior. \\n\\n**Dog Personality and Behavior**\\n\\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\\n\\n   * Snugglebug. \\n\\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?\\n\\n   * Either is fine. \\n\\n15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?\\n\\n   * Friendly is preferred, but Aloof is fine. I would not like a dog breed prone to reactivity. Of course, I will be training and de-sensitizing, but there are some more prone to reactivity than others, as you know.\\n\\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\\n\\n   * No. I would prefer that they are either ambivalent or dog-friendly, as I work with many dogs and would like to continue fostering.\\n\\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?\\n\\n   * High prey drive cannot be a factor, I have two cats and foster. I would prefer if they were friendly to small animals or felt the need to protect them, as my deceased baby did. \\n\\n**Lifestyle**\\n\\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\\n\\n   * Almost never. There is almost always someone home, but I will be the sole caretaker. \\n\\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?\\n\\n   * I will be the sole caretaker. The others can let them out to use the bathroom in the backyard, but I will be taking full care of the dog. They have no specific preferences outside of wanting a dog that will not harm other dogs or cats.\\n\\n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?\\n\\n   * Two cats. My mom, whom I live with, has a small lhasapoo that she rescued.\\n\\n21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\\n\\n   * No.\\n\\n22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\\n\\n   * No. I own.\\n\\n23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\\n\\n   * No breed restrictions. \\n\\n24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\\n\\n   * An average summer day is about 95 F with a Feels Like temp that CAN hit 106 due to high humidity. Typical winter day is around 70 F, but sometimes dips below 50 F (not frequently, maybe 30 days total in a year and always scattered between several winter months). \\n\\n**Additional Information and Questions**\\n\\n25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.\\n\\n   * My Bean died of osteosarcoma and I am petrified of another serious illness like osteosarcoma or hemangiosarcoma. I know must dog breeds suffer from cancer, but I would appreciate any feedback on how to lessen their odds of having to go through that. \\n\\n26) Feel free to ask any questions below.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's it!! Thank you for any suggestions you may provide.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1hehhhe/my_girl_5y_died_of_cancer_8_months_agoneed_help/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'My 16 year old chi-mix also has dementia and I\\'ve been watching its progression for about 1-1.25 years now. Now, this is 1-1.25 years from when she really started showing clearer dementia symptoms (starting to whimper for no reason, starting to pace a bit aimlessly, neurological weakness in her hind legs, being unsettled more). However, even before that, the subtle symptoms  began around 2 years ago (age 13-14 or so). Those symptoms are like your Pom\\'s current symptoms. My sweet girl, who used to let us carry her around like a baby in our arms, and who used to be excited to meet every single stranger she came across (when younger she worked as a therapy dog visiting patients in long term elderly care) , started showing aggression to my spouse and I. She would growl when we approached her face for snuggles, occasionally bite us, starting forgetting her tricks (she used to know a ton), stopped wanting to be handled as much yet was still clingy, starting walking past our house and not recognizing it, spent more time by herself etc. It was a change in character that we initially chalked up to old age or slight body pains. At that time, we got her x-rayed, full body examined, blood panel, etc and she had a clean bill of health so we knew her change in demeanor was not due to pain at that moment. But 2 years later, now today, our girl is very deep and clearly into the late stages of dementia. She now walks in circles, gets stuck behind furniture, can no longer solve food puzzles shes had her whole life and used to previously crush with ease, doesnt seek our attention, and seemingly has lost her volition/intent in her actions...shes almost like a passenger in her own body and no longer in control...I\\'ve been accepting that her time with us is coming to end. \\n\\nI wish I had recognized her symptoms earlier, when they first began. It was only about 1 year ago when my vet and I started coming up with a gameplan in terms of supplements/treatment/medication to help slow the dementia down. CCD will 100 percent progress in its severity, but the rate of which may be slowed if you take action. Even so, while we had managed her dementia well for the last 6 months, it still took a sudden turn for the worse this last week, even though we have continued the same program. Its the unfortunate nature of this terrible disease. \\n\\nMy advice for u is to ensure that you are treating all the possible causations that are possibly due to pain (make sure her dental is good, and that she has treatment for arthritis if she has that, have her ears examined for infections etc), and if that doesn\\'t change your dogs demeanor, you should start thinking about dementia as the causation. If your vet is not familiar with CCD, and many are not, change vets. Many vets just think its anxiety, and prescribe meds for those symptoms. I had to find a vet that understood CCD and that would prescribe me Anipryl/Selegeline, which is the only FDA approved drug to treat CCD in dogs. Our girl is also on senilife supplement.  That being said, the most helpful for us has been the introduction of Gabapentin, which both calms her anxiety and helps with pain  If you want a great resource on this topic, considering reading Eileen Anderson\\'s book \"Remember Me.\"  It consolidates a lot of info about dementia in dogs. My vet also provided me with great summary about other potential  drugs/supps that we should try throughout this journey. DM me and I\\'ll forward to you. \\n\\nThe tough part about dogs at this age is that there are often comorbidities. Their vision can be getting worse, there hearing is diminishing, and in turn that also affects their ability to interact with the environment and keep their brain stimulated and strong. My girl got worse as she became more deaf, and more recently her vision has gotten worse which also seems to have made her symptoms worse. She started having more accidents in the house, not only because of her dementia, but also because she started showing signs of kidney disease at age 15.  If you can, try to keep your dog engaged with exercise, training, or some other mental stimulation, to the extent that she is comfortable doing so...studies show that dogs on dementia meds do even better when they have exercise/stimulation. Lastly, please baby proof their environment. Consider putting down yoga mats for traction throughout the house.  As dogs progress in dementia, they started doing wild Sh\\\\*t they never would have done before. My girl who used to train agility, would now face plant jumping off sidewalk curbs because she couldn\\'t judge distance anymore. She also zoomied straight into a wall the other day.  My first dog that had dementia who passed 4 years ago, jumped through the rungs of our 2nd story railing, he survived but it clearly was not good for him.  Lastly, be patient with your pup and yourself and dont be too hard on yourself. Realize that none of the things your dog is doing, is out of spite or within their control, and realize that there will be bumps along the way and that you are doing the best you can to control the things within your reach.

After a few weeks of this, he started to become reactive when I got close to him so I stopped the medication. Luckily, it’s summer and he no longer has dry eyes. \\n\\nIn the past few months, he’s become more and more aggressive towards me, my boyfriend and everyone that he knows. It’s to the point where I can’t even put his leash on without him biting my hands. I’m not sure if it’s to do with being upset about the past treatment plan, but I’m also starting to wonder if it’s dementia/cognitive decline. \\n\\nHe seems upset and confused most of the day and was the most cuddly dog in the past. \\n\\nHe still eats normally, uses the washroom outside, does tricks (on some days) and knows his way to the park. He’s friendly with other dogs on the street but barely walks- he’s incredibly slow and has trouble turning corners. I can see his legs shaking but if I pick him up, he’ll bark loudly in my arms and try his best to bite me. \\n\\nAt night, he lays in bed and barks as if someone is there when I’m in the other room. I try to calm him down but he threatens to attack me so I just try to leave him alone. He also stopped letting my boyfriend get near him even though he’s been in his life since he was a puppy. \\n\\nI took him to the vet, he thinks the sudden aggression is to do with pain, arthritis and cognitive decline. He mentioned the main signs of dementia are things like house soiling, pacing, forgetting where his dish his but he doesn’t do any of those things. \\nInstead, he just has a total change of character- more aggressive, reactive, doesn’t want to be touched/looked at. \\n\\nAll of my friends think it’s time to euthanize him because he’s a completely different dog than he was a year ago, but I’m honestly not sure if this is a case of negative conditioning from his past treatment or if he is seriously confused/in pain. \\n\\nIf you could please let me know your thoughts/experiences with senior dogs with CCD I would greatly appreciate it. \\n\\nI don’t want to euthanize a healthy dog that is just upset, but I also don’t want to make him live in pain if that’s the case. \", 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it.

Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things.

It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation.

I want a dog who won\\'t rip my arm out of its socket to greet every rando it sees but one who can be trusted around strangers. My husband and I love to go to breweries and our favorites are dog friendly, so my dream is to have a dog who enjoys that sort of environment but will remain calm and content to just hang with us.

I see it more as an opportunity for the dog to kind of sniff around outside the home while off leash in a secured area than the ideal way to burn energy off it. _x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n9)\\tHow much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\*I currently work a part time job in a grooming salon as a bather so I\\'m already brushing other peoples\\' dogs for hours every week and have no problem brushing out my own multiple times a week as needed. I have minimal experience doing full haircuts but am comfortable in trimming a dog\\'s paw pads and sanitary. If I got something that needed a more complex haircut I didn\\'t feel comfortable attempting, I would absolutely bring it in as often as needed. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\*\\\\*Personal Preferences\\\\*\\\\*_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n10)\\tWhat size dog are you looking for?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Ideally something in the medium range, like 35-50 pounds but am willing to go larger or somewhat smaller. Husband is not on board with very small breeds (has already said \"absolutely not\" to Chihuahuas)\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Shedding I\\'m fine with though I\\'m more okay with fluffy hairs or dust bunnies then the tiny stabby hairs my current short-coated dog leaves everywhere. At the risk of sounding like a freak, I feel it extremely satisfying to brush or blow out huge amounts of fluffy undercoat on a thick double coated dog. \\n\\nBarking I can handle and I realize I may be over-confident at times in my abilities but I did manage to train my once-barky mix to be, well, significantly less barky. To the point at least where she wouldn\\'t bark at any strange noise but would alert for the doorbell/a knock but would settle quickly when asked. I understand that dogs will bark and just prefer that they can be taught to tone it down or stop when called off, if that makes sense or sounds realistic? \\n\\n Slobber I would rather not have._x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Not at all important. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\*\\\\*Dog Personality and Behavior\\\\*\\\\*_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* More on the snuggly side \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Eager to please\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  _x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I would appreciate a dog who is alert but whose first response is not \"attack\". If someone is being welcomed into my home, I don\\'t need them to be exuberantly greeting them but don\\'t want to have to worry about someone getting hurt or the dog being anxious at their presence. Neutral is probably the word I\\'m looking for. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I want to be able to take the dog into public and to get-togethers with family who have dogs so I would rather not have one that is a potential danger to others.\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I would really not want to deal with true separation anxiety, which I know is a concern potentially in some of the breeds I like\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\*\\\\*Lifestyle\\\\*\\\\*_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Right now I only work 3-4 days a week because I\\'m in school, which is mostly online. With the way my schedule lines up with my husbands, the dog is looking at being alone for a maximum of maybe 5 hours a couple days a week. _x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? _x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* My husband is much more of a cat person and while he is accepting of a dog, he will mainly be taking it outside on bathroom breaks and feeding it at times I cannot. He mainly wants a dog that is not too small, not brachy, and will listen to him. While I\\'m going to be the one who mainly works with the dog training-wise, he understands he needs to help reinforce the behaviors. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I\\'m not expecting to get this hypothetical dog until my current one passes, so future dog would be for a time at least the only dog in the household though I do want to be a multi-dog household eventually. We do have a cat who has lived with current dog all his life and previously also lived in a house with retired racing greyhounds so he is at least moderately dog-savvy. We also have a couple of small reptiles who of course will never come into contact with any other pet. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Not likely\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* We do currently rent an apartment. No weight restrictions, but your expected banned breeds (no bully breeds, Dobermans, Rotties, Akitas, Huskies, German or Belgian shepherds)\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I live in Southern California, USA and no breed bans. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Summer in my area can get over 90 degrees F.

Our apartment itself isn\\'t a struggle to keep cool in the summer due to its position and our central air so I don\\'t feel super concerned about keeping a double coated dog comfortable during the hot months. It\\'s also surprisingly well sound-proofed in that I share a living room wall with someone who has a husky I can never hear unless I\\'m outside and they have the windows open, so I\\'m not worried about getting in trouble with neighbors if I do end up with a barky dog.

TL;DR at end. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads and/or comments. Formatted on mobile. I tried to organize it in a way that makes sense. \\n\\nPicture of my dog and 19 pictures of some (not all) of the damage he’s done when left alone in the last three months [can be found here](https://imgur.com/a/ViQUkWG). Warning, there are some light bloodstains in some pictures. \\n\\n# General Background\\n\\n* My dog Khan is about 10 or 11 years old, he weighs 60lbs, and he is very loved. I adopted him a little over 4.5 years ago. The shelter said he was a black mouth mountain cur, but he’s probably mixed. All I know about his past is he was shipped up from the south like many dogs are to avoid kill shelters, and a woman had him for a month before me but gave him back because he was too clingy. \\n\\n* Khan has always been clingy, but in the past three months his separation anxiety has become very severe and keeps escalating. I’ve brought him to the vet (bloodwork was fine) and consulted with a separation anxiety behaviorist, and they both think in addition to the separation anxiety he is also suffering from canine cognitive dysfunction (dog dementia). He seems physically fine, and he has a cushioned step for my bed in case he is hiding joint pain, which he uses sometimes. He is on Prozac and Valium, details can be found below. \\n\\n* For years he was totally fine being left alone even though he was clingy. He always had free range, he’s not a crate dog. The vet and behaviorist both said a crate would make him suffer even more and I agree. \\n\\n* We live in an apartment in a city right next to a huge park and a huge dog park. My room is also pretty big. He goes to the park twice a day and goes out once more at night. When I\\'m at work he has a dogwalker who he loves. \\n\\n* We also live with a roommate who he is very bonded to, he used to sleep with her instead of me every night (heartbreaking!) until the dementia set in and she couldn\\'t handle him waking her up, now she shuts him out of her room at all times which I think stresses him out more. This all started after she went on vacation one week a month for about three months but didn\\'t stop when she came back, she\\'s been home for three months now. But she is going to be gone three weeks next month and that means he\\'s going to freak out even more than he has been the past three months when she was home. The other night she told me I should consider putting him to sleep which shocked me. Then she suggested I give him away which also shocked me. It would be so cruel to abandon a dog with abandonment issues, and I doubt anyone else would do as much as I am to help him. I love him so much, I thought she did too. I think the apartment damage is really stressing her out but I\\'m going to pay to fix it. We\\'re friends but the whole situation is becoming a source of tension. My family and co-workers also think it\\'s time. \\n\\n* For three years we lived with my exSO who he was very bonded with, but he handled the transition when we moved about 10 months ago way better than I expected. They still see each other about once a month. He frequently travels out of state for work though so he can\\'t really help out a lot. \\n\\n* Whoever trained him did a great job, I worry they were strict though because he isn’t very playful. He likes to chew on antlers and ostrich knuckles and plays with a frozen treat Kong but only for a little bit and only if we are home, he won\\'t touch them if we\\'re gone. He never destroyed anything in the past. I could leave a steak on the floor and tell him not to touch it and leave the apartment and he wouldn’t. So what I’m about to describe is very out of character. We eventually decided to get a tall thick metal gate to keep him in my room because he was so destructive to the apartment and my roommate\\'s things.\\n\\n* I work full time, but in four days (have a dogwalker as mentioned above). So three days of the week I\\'m home all day with him, I don\\'t go out and don\\'t have anyone over because that stresses him out too. Sometimes I have errands or appointments and have to leave a little bit. I used to practice leaving in short increments to desensitize him before I was told by a behaviorist that was futile because of the severity of anxiety, more details on that below. I have to practically wrestle him into my gated room before I leave, he really resists it. If I could work from home I would. \\n\\n# Symptoms\\n\\n### Separation Anxiety\\n\\n* I want to preface this by saying I value him way above the damage he has caused, and I do not punish him for it. In the past three months he has clawed/chewed up six door frames, six doors, a windowsill, a tall teal standing cabinet (and knocked it over and shredded the shreddable contents twice), a dresser, a vanity, a laundry basket, a chair, part of a vacuum cleaner, two thick metal bars from a gate, etc. I leave cardboard for him and he\\'ll chew that but it doesn\\'t prevent him from scratching up wood. I\\'m really worried he\\'s going to hurt himself, so far he\\'s split a few nails and when he ripped the bars off the gate there was blood. He also pushed my vanity into my room and the legs are unstable, so for weeks all my furniture has been clumped in a corner surrounded by barriers so he cant move it, but he still finds ways to chew and scratch it. \\n\\n* He never has accidents, but gets terrified when I take him out to pee at night and he usually refuses and drags me back to the stoop. In the daytime he doesn\\'t pee on multiple things on our walks like he used to, just pees once. He won\\'t eat or drink or play with his toys when we\\'re gone. When he panics he pants and individual drops of drool fall, by the time I get home there\\'s a huge puddle by the gate. I\\'ve filmed him before and the destruction starts as soon as I leave. Some days the Valium works better than other days and he barely destroys anything. \\n\\n* He also is not as interested in food and only eats a little bit at a time, instead of excitedly wolfing it down. He usually still likes treats though, unless he is panicking, then he refuses to eat anything. As I mentioned before he will not eat or drink alone. \\n\\n### Dementia\\n\\n* The reason he also was diagnosed with dementia is sometimes he\\'ll just stare off into space in the middle of the room and he\\'ll try to go into a different apartment than ours after walks and he panics even when I\\'m home (but is only destructive when alone), and he gets worse at night. He forgets his \"sit\" command unless the Valium works better than usual, things like that. \\n\\n* At nighttime he frequently wakes me up panicking. At his worst he\\'ll wake me up every 20 minutes, pretty much as soon as I fall back asleep. If I\\'m lucky and the Valium works better than usual it happens in two hour increments. He will be shaking and panting and have a crazy look in his eye, and he\\'ll jam his nose in my eye socket and thrust his head upward, or sit on my face or chest or step on my long hair and rip it out or straddle my chest and refuse to move trapping me, etc. I used to try taking him outside but he doesn\\'t have to pee because he just panics there too, like I described earlier. \\n\\n# Medication\\n\\n* He has been on Prozac titrating up for two months, he’s been on 60mg for about two weeks. He also gets a total of 30mg of Valium a day, split into two doses for when I’m at work and nighttime. In the past we tried Xanax and Trazodone but neither helped. He also gets strong strength dog CBD everyday. \\n\\n* The Prozac/Valium/CBD is helping a little, but not that much, and it’s clear he’s going to keep getting worse. Last time I talked to my vet she said she was out of ideas for medication but I’ll reach out to her again. I was told to see a board certified vet behaviorist, essentially a vet psychiatrist, because they have more training in the nuances of brain medication, but there are very few in the country and I was quoted $900 for a consultation which unfortunately I can’t afford. I was also told by the separation anxiety specialist that we can’t work on training him unless the medication worked because when dogs are too anxious their brains can’t create memories necessary for training. \\n\\n# Other Things I\\'ve Tried\\n\\nThings I\\'ve tried (open to ideas if you have them): \\n* Taping cardboard over the door, thick gaffe and duct tape over the door, taping a towel over the door, putting a vacuum in the way, doing a lemon/vinegar rub (this worked but caused him to move onto furniture). \\n* Various types of calming treats and a calming pheromone scent. \\n* Medication described above. \\n* Extra exercise and longs walks.\\n* Leaving a fan, lights, Bob Ross, and calming dog music playlist or long audiobook on. Leaving a frozen Kong which he won\\'t touch anymore.\\n* Thundershirt. \\n* My ex took him for three days so I could paint my dark navy room a light color which I thought might help with the nighttime anxiety but it hasn\\'t. I also spackled and painted over some of the damage but his first day back he tore the door frame up again. \\n* Getting ready to leave but sitting around, leaving in seconds to minutes increasing increments, not acknowledging or making a big deal about coming home or leaving.\\n\\n# Other Factors\\n\\n* I try really hard to be patient with him at night but the sleep deprivation is taking a toll. Unfortunately when I get woken up repeatedly I sometimes lose control of my mood and react before thinking and get frustrated with him and push him away or yell, then I feel so guilty because I know it\\'s not his fault and getting frustrated makes it worse. Full disclosure I have bipolar disorder and anxiety, I\\'m well medicated and have been for years but can\\'t take my insomnia medication anymore because him waking me up on it would make me hallucinate. \\n\\n* I\\'m trying to keep the effects on all of this on me out of my decision about when it\\'s time to let go, even though it is taking a financial (vet bills, apartment repairs, various potential remedies, etc), physical, and mental toll. The decision when/if to let go will be made with his quality of life in mind first and foremost. I just don\\'t know though. I feel bad because I know how panic attacks feel and I don\\'t know if it\\'s cruel to keep him alive when he experiences them so frequently and for so long. He is also terrified of thunderstorms and fireworks, and doesn\\'t handle heat well (for example frantically digs holes to lay in and cool down during walks despite drinking lots of water) and it\\'s getting to be that time of the year. My roommate also just dropped the bombshell that she wants to terminate the lease this September 2019 instead of 2020 like we planned, and I don\\'t think he can handle another move. I love him so much. He\\'s definitely suffering but has good moments sometimes, but the bad times are bad. He isn\\'t the dog he used to be, and I know the prognosis is his brain will keep deteriorating. \\n\\nTL;DR My senior dog has severe separation anxiety and dementia and is not responding to medication.

I’ve tried nearly everything I can to help alleviate some of the problems that I am currently dealing with, and every single solution has turned up nothing. And so, I turn to you, hoping that you might be able to provide an answer. \\n\\nI have a two year old male corgi named Basco, who is honestly my favorite thing on this earth. He is kind, and sweet, and gentle (at least with living things), and he’s made my life feel a lot happier. But, he has had some incredibly serious behavioral issues that I cannot seem to find an explanation for. To be honest, I’m certain that somehow, I’m doing something wrong, but for the life of me, I cannot figure out what it is. I’ll go into detail on everything that has happened down below, but any and all advice you all can provide would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!\\n\\nThe issues started roughly 3 months ago. Basco has had some behavioral problems in the past, but they were mostly related to him not following commands outside of carefully controlled environments (despite lots of work with our trainer), and occasionally chewing on things. He also took nearly a year to be properly house trained. He’s an incredibly smart dog (as most corgis are), but he’s also really stubborn, and if he wants to do or to not do something, it’s his way or the highway. We actually had a previous trainer refer us to somebody else, because we went through several months of her classes and nothing about his behavior changed. His potty training has improved, and is down to around 1-2 accidents per week now, but he is still really stubborn, and lately, he has gotten incredibly destructive.\\n\\nWe recently moved to a new city for a new job of mine, and it’s my first job where I actually have to go into work, as I started work during the pandemic. I made a point to give him alone time during this period, so that way when I would eventually stop working from home, he wouldn’t have separation anxiety. When we moved to our new apartment, things started out fairly decent. However, in the past 3 months, he has cost me nearly a thousand dollars in damages, and now has to be confined to a very small part of my tiled kitchen when I am not home.\\n\\nIn the past 3 months he has destroyed: several wires, all of which should not have been in his reach, and I still to this day do not know how he got them, the legs of my coffee table, an entire couch (yes, the whole thing. It was equally impressive and frustrating. I had to throw out the couch. It was that bad), my bike, which I store indoors, a tv stand, and he has chewed his way through the bottom of my trash can, chewed a hole in my wall, and has annihilated my carpet to the point that I have to pay to re-carpet my entire apartment. He has also chewed and bent the electrical heating units along my baseboards in several places. Not sure what they’re properly called, but it’s the white metal bars that run along the wall near the floor in place of heating by ventilation. He also is not allowed to have dog beds, as he destroys them within minutes, and has even bent the bars of his kennel!\\n\\nAt first, I thought he was just confused or anxious about the new environment. So I made a point about slowly introducing him to new parts of my apartment. I know corgis have a lot of energy, so I make a point of working with him daily to get that out. We go to a doggie day care twice a week in the mornings so he can run and play with other dogs, and the other three days of the week, we either go on walks around my neighborhood or play indoors for at least an hour before I leave for work. (For context, I work 1-9pm, Monday-Friday) I also make sure to do several puzzle toys with him before I leave, and I leave him with a frozen kong of treats and two of those snuffle mat things with hidden treats while I’m at work. I also make sure to leave the tv on, either set to one of those 10 hour doggie TV videos or a long YouTube playlist. I also make time every day before I leave for work to practice commands with him, though if I’m being honest, progress in that department has been pretty poor. We also see a trainer on the weekends, and I make a point about following her directions exactly. \\n\\nBecause of my hours going late, I can’t just leave him at daycare all day, as every daycare within a 50 mile radius of me closes by 6pm, and my hours aren’t really something that I can change due to the nature of my job. The daycare nearest us does allow us to visit for a few hours during the week, (for a fee) which I am highly appreciative of. I’ve also tried using bitter apple sprays as a chew repellant, as well as a vinegar based chew repellant spray that I found online, and neither of these have any effect. I’m honestly convinced my dog doesn’t have taste buds, as neither of these sprays seem to prevent him at all from destroying stuff. Obviously, when I see him engaging in this behavior at home, I make a point of interrupting him, but he doesn’t really seem to learn anything by it, as his behavior there hasn’t changed in the past few months. I also make sure to buy him plenty of new toys to keep his interest, as he pretty much refuses to play with any toy that is more than a week old. \\n\\nHonestly, I’m at a total loss here. My trainer is out of ideas, I’m out of ideas, and as a result, it’s gotten to the point where I have to leave my poor Bosco in a pen, in the middle of my tiled kitchen floor, the entire time I’m at work. (To be clear, this is a recent development. I spent most of the past few months letting him roam the apartment and trying to solve the problem without confining him.) I came home today to find that he had somehow torn up a tile from my floor, meaning that I am now going to have to repair that. I honestly don’t even know how this is possible. I love my dog and truly want to give him the best home possible, and I genuinely want to solve this problem, but I have no clue where to start. So, I ask you, Reddit - what am I doing wrong? Am I getting bad advice? Could I be doing more? Any and all help is appreciated.

Monty never acted like a dog. Never interested in our other dogs. Never played. I\\'m not sure if he was in the beginning stages of canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) aka \"doggy dementia\" or if he simply was never treated like a dog. Either way, over the last year or so, he started showing clear signs of CCD. It started with him just standing in front of a mirror or window and staring. Then, he started walking in circles. He lost all ability to find his way outside (or back in), which meant constantly cleaning up after him. We finally had to secure him in one area of the bedroom whenever we leave the house because he will wander someplace and get \"stuck,\" then start screaming in frustration. A few months ago I had to start helping him eat, because he can no longer maintain his balance enough to stand long enough in one place to eat. We have to help him drink water because he usually can\\'t find the bowl, or can\\'t balance enough to drink from it. But he does know when it\\'s dinner time, and demands it! And, he wants to be around us, so when we\\'re home, he wanders in his circular way to follow wherever we go. His \"awareness\" of us, and his interest in food, have kept me from making the decision to let him go. But, the last few months, we had to switch him to a bland diet of chicken and rice because anything and everything gave him diarrhea. But then he started refusing to eat it (I suspect he\\'s losing almost all his senses, so the bland diet is simply too bland). The ONLY thing he will eat now is roasted chicken. And, that gives him diarrhea. So, yes, he\\'s eating. But he\\'s losing weight because he cannot sustain himself on what he will eat. He\\'s down to 5 pounds (was 8 pounds a year ago). Under all his fluff, he\\'s a skeleton. But, he still demands his food. He still follows us. And so, I\\'m tormented with the decision I must make. I will be going out of town for a week at the end of October. I have already decided that I won\\'t put my SO through having to care for poor Monty on his own, in addition to our other 2 dogs, especially since I have no idea how Monty will react in his declined mental state to my absence (I\\'m Monty\\'s \"person\" and when he\\'s upset, I can calm him by laying him on my chest). So, the latest I will wait is mid-October. But every single day I wonder if I am waiting too long. Or am I trying to justify making the decision because I am so very exhausted (physically, mentally and emotionally)? \\n\\nI\\'m not looking for answers...I know this is a personal decision that only I can make. But maybe someone out there will read my post and feel some comfort knowing they are not alone, as we struggle as caretakers for these wonderful animals, with making the hardest decision we often have to make...when to say goodbye...', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/cwoidn/ventdiscussion_deciding_its_time_when_your_dog/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}], 'link': ['https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/', 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1hehhhe/my_girl_5y_died_of_cancer_8_months_agoneed_help/', 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1e6lvt5/how_did_you_know_when_your_dog_got_dementia/', 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/18dcjbw/brainstorming_breed_ideas_for_the_future/', 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/bg810v/help_i_dont_know_whenif_its_time_to_let_go_of_my/', 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/vfxeuh/my_dog_wont_let_my_partner_sleep_in_our_bed/', 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ywlv34/please_help_my_dog_is_having_behavioral_problems/', 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/cwoidn/ventdiscussion_deciding_its_time_when_your_dog/'], 'content': [], 'documents': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]}, 'professional': {'metadata': [], 'content': [], 'documents': []}, 'images': {'metadata': [], 'paths': [], 'relevance': []}}\n",

If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**\\n\\n*No, I have owned a Cane Corso, American Pitbull Terrier and a GSD Mix. All of my dogs were trained in basic obedience (Sit, Stay, Down, Recall, loose lead walking)*\\n\\n**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**\\n\\n*I just lost my Cane Corse to Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and my APBT to bone cancer within a year of each other. They were 10 and 9, respectively. So, I'll be going the reputable breeder route to minimize any health issues moving forward.*\\n\\n**Describe your ideal dog.**\\n\\n*My dream dog is medium - X- Large, minimal-moderate shedding, easily trainable, happy on a hike or in the house for a movie night. They will accompany me almost everywhere, other than work.*\\n\\n**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**\\n\\n*My dream breed is a Dutch Shepherd, they are the most beautiful breed I've ever seen. Unfortunately, my research has built up some fear of not being able to sufficiently meet the breeds physical exercise requirements, (From my understanding, they are like Malinois level energizer bunnies that just go and go) and I've also read that they do not enjoy cuddling after a days work, which is something I absolutely need in a breed lol.*\\n\\n*This has led me to lean towards the GSD breed. I do not particularly like the look of the showline GSD, but their temperament and exercise requirements seem to be exactly what I need. I LOVE the look of the dark sable working line shepherds, with the more square structure and healthier hips / elbows, but I have the same hesitations that come with the Dutch Shepherds regarding the 23.5hrs a day of exercise required to make them happy lol.*\\n\\n*I also feel like the Doberman could be ideal for me, but their breed-specific health issues seem way too common. Kind of scares me, do NOT want another dog to get sick on me.*\\n\\n**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**\\n\\n*Advanced Obedience (Strict heel, down, stay, sit, place, recall, off-lead obedience for hikes), I will be putting a TON of time and energy into the socialization of my pup so he can go to lots of places with me and be comfortable and happy, and, potentially some bite and scent work training that could translate into IPO-style dog sports for fun.*\\n\\n**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**\\n\\n*This is a possibilty down the road when I think he's bored with our normal training routines. I have 0 experience in this field, however.*\\n\\nCare Commitments\\n\\n**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**\\n\\n*I will be doing about 30-60 mins of obedience training, 60-90mins of physcial play, 2-3 walks about 2 miles each, and as much socialization I can each day. At home, my family will be interacting with him nonstop (light play indoors, cuddling, etc.)*\\n\\n**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**\\n\\n*an hour - hour and a half of physical exercise is a realistic number I can hit daily (more on weekends as I go for hikes or walk through state parks on saturday mornings), I also calculate mental and physical exercise as separate activities, so we will also be doing another 30/60 mins of mental exercise via obedience training and puzzles. This includes walks around the neghborhood, playing in our fenced backyard, going to any of the local parks, hiking, etc.*\\n\\n*I will NOT be using a dog park. I have seen way too many untrained dogs at dog parks that just become a danger to have around my pups. my pit was attacked at a dog park, it took me years to make her comfortable around strange dogs again. We will walk through dog parks, but we will not be going into the kennel areas and going off leash for unstructured play with strange dogs.*\\n\\n**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**\\n\\n*I'd prefer a brushing once or twice a week, cleaning ears is fine with me, but I do not want to have to pay a groomer for constant haircuts.*\\n\\nPersonal Preferences\\n\\n**10) What size dog are you looking for?**\\n\\n*Medium to large but Extra Large is also fine with me.*\\n\\n**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**\\n\\n*My Cane Corso slobbered me out, I am now looking for as little drool as I can get while maintaining some of the traits I need. He will be my going everywhere he’s allowed to with me, so slobbering can make people uncomfortable in public or at BBQ's or something lol.*\\n\\n**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**\\n\\n*I would love to be able to keep my dog off-lead whenever it is safe to do so. I'd say very important.*\\n\\nDog Personality and Behavior\\n\\n**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**\\n\\n*I actually love both of these personalities. My APBT was a snuggle bug, while my Cane Corso would get up and go lay across the room after a few minutes of petting. If I had to choose, I'd say I prefer a snuggly dog.*\\n\\n**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**\\n\\n*Eagerness to please is a necessity for my plans with my pup.*\\n\\n**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**\\n\\n*I would prefer for the dog to have guarding instincts, for sure. I have a son who plays in my yard and If a stranger enters my yard, they should know IMMEDIATELY  that they are not welcome. (My Corso was EXCEPTIONAL at this, while my Pit just wanted to love on everyone she saw lol). Knocking on my door -- I'd prefer an alert bark. The dog will be put into a place while I answer the door.*\\n\\n**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**\\n\\n*I hope, with the amount of socialization I'd be working on through puppyhood, that this wouldn't be an issue but, if it was, I would absolutely put the work in to fix this behaviour.*\\n\\n**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**\\n\\n*The way people talk about Huskies just bolting over fences or out of doors because they want to roam seems like an absolute nightmare. Insanely high prey drive is also something I'd like to avoid, as I live in an area that has a LOT of rabbits and small dogs walking around with their owners.*\\n\\nLifestyle\\n\\n**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**\\n\\n*The dog will be alone for 4-6hrs, 2-3 times a week.*\\n\\n**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**\\n\\n*Minimal-Moderate shedding, she will be prepping the dogs meals sometimes and playing / training with him often.*\\n\\n**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**\\n\\n*Unfortunately, no, not anymore.*\\n\\n**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**\\n\\n*Yes, I have a son (2 yrs old) and we spend a lot of time around family members ranging from 3 yrs old to 13 yrs old. I worked with my pit, who would get over excited when she saw my son and I am aware of the rough play risk a dog can pose. I am willing and able to work around this.*\\n\\n**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**\\n\\n*Never renting again.*\\n\\n**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**\\n\\n*I live in PA, USA, North America, Earth. No breed restrictions.*\\n\\n**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**\\n\\n*Peak Summer: \\\\\\\\\\\\~85 F, Peak winter: \\\\\\\\\\\\~30 F*\\n\\nAdditional Information and Questions\\n\\n**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**\\n\\n*I have a 2yr old son, a half acre yard surrounded by 6ft fences. There are many parks around me that are dog friendly.*\\n\\n*I have experience dealing with trouble behaviors (ex. my Cane Corso had crazy resource guarding and food aggression when we first got him).*\\n\\n*I'm looking for a dog that can go on hikes with me, but also chill at family functions for extended periods of time. I also want to be able to train to very high levels of obedience.*\\n\\n**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**\\n\\n*I feel like the working line GSD would require far too much exercise than I could realistically provide, but I have no in-person experience with them.*\\n\\n*Based on my information provided, does any one with working line GSD experience think I could provide the stimulation that would let them live a happy and fulfilled life?*\\n\\n*Is there a breed out there (that isn't a poodle) that actually fits all of the things I'm looking for?*\\n\\nThank you for reading all of this, looking forward to hearing your recommendations!\\n\\nEdit: I removed any misused terms to avoid further issues.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 0, 'content': \"My Girl (5Y) Died of Cancer 8 Months Ago—Need Help Finding a Breed that Suits Me and Info on How to Avoid Significant Health Issues.  \\nHello Everyone! I'm sorry for being another annoying breed recommendation post, but I'd really love the help of more knowledgeable people in looking on what breed fits my lifestyle and some recommendations for further research.\\n\\n  \\n**Introduction**\\n\\n1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\\n   * No. I've had dogs all my life. My girl, Bean, was the first puppy I've ever owned and trained (very successfully; she was often mistaken for a service dog due to how well she followed commands and her attention to her handler, me). However, I have lived with dogs my entire life. \\n2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a\\xa0[reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?\\n   * I've never purchased a dog and would like to rescue, but I am afraid of potential health issues  like Bean's, which is forcing me to consider purchasing a puppy from a reputable breeder with proven healthy lineages. \\n3. Describe your ideal dog.\\n   * I'd love a cuddly dog, handler-focused, clingy, and energetic but not so much as a working breed. I also LOVE dogs with goofy personalities, but that's more specific to the dog and less to a breed, I assume. \\n4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\\n   * Aesthetically, I love Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Anatolian Shepards, Rottweilers, and American Alsatians (which I recently heard are BYB dogs, which really put a damper on things, since they sounded pretty perfect to me). I just LOVE a huge dog with a big ole head and floppy ears. I also love Pitties/Bullies, but I can't really narrow it down to one specific breed, since I've only ever had pittie mix rescues. I just don't know enough about breed standards to provide a standard I'm interested in. I don't typically like curly haired breeds.\\n5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\\n   * Basic obedience and possibly dog sports, if the breed has more intense enrichment needs. This would be a companion dog, not a working dog.\\n6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\\n   * No desire/need to compete or have the dog work, but I'm willing to do anything to meet my dog's needs.\\n\\n**Care Commitments**\\n\\n7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\\n\\n   * At least an hour to two hours a day, but I was planning on leaving them at training/ doggy daycare while I work so that they get appropriate enrichment time. I enjoy training, playing, and walking with my dog and would love a dog that can both do that and also is happy to lay in bed with me on a lazy sunday. \\n\\n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?\\n\\n   * I volunteer at my local shelter and have done animal handling training, which makes me believe that dog parks are unnecessarily dangerous to dogs and can put undue stress on them because of the mixed playstyles and constant rotation of new players. I will not be doing dog parks. I like nature walks, short hikes, taking my dog out on the town (to dog-friendly areas), and I have a large backyard. I'd also walk them at least once a day on top of our outdoor time. \\n\\n9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\\n\\n   * I can groom regularly at home but am much more likely to pay a professional. My Bean was a short-haired bully mix and got groomed every 2-3 weeks. I love long-haired dogs but am afraid they'll overheat (Florida). \\n\\n**Personal Preferences**\\n\\n10) What size dog are you looking for?\\n\\n   * L-XL breeds. The bigger the better so long as their average lifespan is above 10. \\n\\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\\n\\n   * All of it. No such thing as too much from my baby. I deep clean regularly.\\n\\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\\n\\n   * Not at all. I have a fenced backyard and never let my dog off-leash in public due to danger from people or other dogs' behavior. \\n\\n**Dog Personality and Behavior**\\n\\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\\n\\n   * Snugglebug. \\n\\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?\\n\\n   * Either is fine. \\n\\n15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?\\n\\n   * Friendly is preferred, but Aloof is fine. I would not like a dog breed prone to reactivity. Of course, I will be training and de-sensitizing, but there are some more prone to reactivity than others, as you know.\\n\\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\\n\\n   * No. I would prefer that they are either ambivalent or dog-friendly, as I work with many dogs and would like to continue fostering.\\n\\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?\\n\\n   * High prey drive cannot be a factor, I have two cats and foster. I would prefer if they were friendly to small animals or felt the need to protect them, as my deceased baby did. \\n\\n**Lifestyle**\\n\\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\\n\\n   * Almost never. There is almost always someone home, but I will be the sole caretaker. \\n\\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?\\n\\n   * I will be the sole caretaker. The others can let them out to use the bathroom in the backyard, but I will be taking full care of the dog. They have no specific preferences outside of wanting a dog that will not harm other dogs or cats.\\n\\n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?\\n\\n   * Two cats. My mom, whom I live with, has a small lhasapoo that she rescued.\\n\\n21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\\n\\n   * No.\\n\\n22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\\n\\n   * No. I own.\\n\\n23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\\n\\n   * No breed restrictions. \\n\\n24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\\n\\n   * An average summer day is about 95 F with a Feels Like temp that CAN hit 106 due to high humidity. Typical winter day is around 70 F, but sometimes dips below 50 F (not frequently, maybe 30 days total in a year and always scattered between several winter months). \\n\\n**Additional Information and Questions**\\n\\n25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.\\n\\n   * My Bean died of osteosarcoma and I am petrified of another serious illness like osteosarcoma or hemangiosarcoma. I know must dog breeds suffer from cancer, but I would appreciate any feedback on how to lessen their odds of having to go through that. \\n\\n26) Feel free to ask any questions below.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's it!!

Now, this is 1-1.25 years from when she really started showing clearer dementia symptoms (starting to whimper for no reason, starting to pace a bit aimlessly, neurological weakness in her hind legs, being unsettled more). However, even before that, the subtle symptoms  began around 2 years ago (age 13-14 or so). Those symptoms are like your Pom\\'s current symptoms. My sweet girl, who used to let us carry her around like a baby in our arms, and who used to be excited to meet every single stranger she came across (when younger she worked as a therapy dog visiting patients in long term elderly care) , started showing aggression to my spouse and I. She would growl when we approached her face for snuggles, occasionally bite us, starting forgetting her tricks (she used to know a ton), stopped wanting to be handled as much yet was still clingy, starting walking past our house and not recognizing it, spent more time by herself etc. It was a change in character that we initially chalked up to old age or slight body pains. At that time, we got her x-rayed, full body examined, blood panel, etc and she had a clean bill of health so we knew her change in demeanor was not due to pain at that moment. But 2 years later, now today, our girl is very deep and clearly into the late stages of dementia. She now walks in circles, gets stuck behind furniture, can no longer solve food puzzles shes had her whole life and used to previously crush with ease, doesnt seek our attention, and seemingly has lost her volition/intent in her actions...shes almost like a passenger in her own body and no longer in control...I\\'ve been accepting that her time with us is coming to end. \\n\\nI wish I had recognized her symptoms earlier, when they first began. It was only about 1 year ago when my vet and I started coming up with a gameplan in terms of supplements/treatment/medication to help slow the dementia down. CCD will 100 percent progress in its severity, but the rate of which may be slowed if you take action. Even so, while we had managed her dementia well for the last 6 months, it still took a sudden turn for the worse this last week, even though we have continued the same program. Its the unfortunate nature of this terrible disease. \\n\\nMy advice for u is to ensure that you are treating all the possible causations that are possibly due to pain (make sure her dental is good, and that she has treatment for arthritis if she has that, have her ears examined for infections etc), and if that doesn\\'t change your dogs demeanor, you should start thinking about dementia as the causation. If your vet is not familiar with CCD, and many are not, change vets. Many vets just think its anxiety, and prescribe meds for those symptoms. I had to find a vet that understood CCD and that would prescribe me Anipryl/Selegeline, which is the only FDA approved drug to treat CCD in dogs. Our girl is also on senilife supplement.  That being said, the most helpful for us has been the introduction of Gabapentin, which both calms her anxiety and helps with pain  If you want a great resource on this topic, considering reading Eileen Anderson\\'s book \"Remember Me.\"  It consolidates a lot of info about dementia in dogs. My vet also provided me with great summary about other potential  drugs/supps that we should try throughout this journey. DM me and I\\'ll forward to you. \\n\\nThe tough part about dogs at this age is that there are often comorbidities. Their vision can be getting worse, there hearing is diminishing, and in turn that also affects their ability to interact with the environment and keep their brain stimulated and strong. My girl got worse as she became more deaf, and more recently her vision has gotten worse which also seems to have made her symptoms worse. She started having more accidents in the house, not only because of her dementia, but also because she started showing signs of kidney disease at age 15.  If you can, try to keep your dog engaged with exercise, training, or some other mental stimulation, to the extent that she is comfortable doing so...studies show that dogs on dementia meds do even better when they have exercise/stimulation. Lastly, please baby proof their environment. Consider putting down yoga mats for traction throughout the house.  As dogs progress in dementia, they started doing wild Sh\\\\*t they never would have done before. My girl who used to train agility, would now face plant jumping off sidewalk curbs because she couldn\\'t judge distance anymore. She also zoomied straight into a wall the other day.  My first dog that had dementia who passed 4 years ago, jumped through the rungs of our 2nd story railing, he survived but it clearly was not good for him.  Lastly, be patient with your pup and yourself and dont be too hard on yourself. Realize that none of the things your dog is doing, is out of spite or within their control, and realize that there will be bumps along the way and that you are doing the best you can to control the things within your reach. Good luck, I feel for you bc its a hard path', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1e6lvt5/how_did_you_know_when_your_dog_got_dementia/', 'parent_question': \"How did you know when your dog got dementia? \\n\\n\\nI have a 14 year old Pomeranian who I love dearly, he's my first dog and I just want to make the right choice (my apologies if this is long) \\n\\nA few months ago, my pup developed dry eyes which required me to do daily eye drops. After a few weeks of this, he started to become reactive when I got close to him so I stopped the medication. Luckily, it’s summer and he no longer has dry eyes. \\n\\nIn the past few months, he’s become more and more aggressive towards me, my boyfriend and everyone that he knows. It’s to the point where I can’t even put his leash on without him biting my hands. I’m not sure if it’s to do with being upset about the past treatment plan, but I’m also starting to wonder if it’s dementia/cognitive decline. \\n\\nHe seems upset and confused most of the day and was the most cuddly dog in the past. \\n\\nHe still eats normally, uses the washroom outside, does tricks (on some days) and knows his way to the park. He’s friendly with other dogs on the street but barely walks- he’s incredibly slow and has trouble turning corners. I can see his legs shaking but if I pick him up, he’ll bark loudly in my arms and try his best to bite me. \\n\\nAt night, he lays in bed and barks as if someone is there when I’m in the other room. I try to calm him down but he threatens to attack me so I just try to leave him alone. He also stopped letting my boyfriend get near him even though he’s been in his life since he was a puppy. \\n\\nI took him to the vet, he thinks the sudden aggression is to do with pain, arthritis and cognitive decline. He mentioned the main signs of dementia are things like house soiling, pacing, forgetting where his dish his but he doesn’t do any of those things. \\nInstead, he just has a total change of character- more aggressive, reactive, doesn’t want to be touched/looked at. \\n\\nAll of my friends think it’s time to euthanize him because he’s a completely different dog than he was a year ago, but I’m honestly not sure if this is a case of negative conditioning from his past treatment or if he is seriously confused/in pain. \\n\\nIf you could please let me know your thoughts/experiences with senior dogs with CCD I would greatly appreciate it. \\n\\nI don’t want to euthanize a healthy dog that is just upset, but I also don’t want to make him live in pain if that’s the case. \", 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal.

I also helped train my aunt\\'s terrier when she was young as well as a few of my other aunt\\'s Rottweilers over the years and would dogsit for them at my home years ago. My husband\\'s childhood dog was a Rough Collie they got from a shelter and after she passed his mom got into Greyhounds. He was largely responsible for their day-to-day care but none of them were actually really trained._x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n2)\\tDo you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \\\\[reputable breeder\\\\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Reputable breeder\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n3)\\tDescribe your ideal dog._x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I want something more on the medium or large side, though I wouldn\\'t rule out a small breed. I prefer breeds that are more biddable and easy to train. Something that does not need to run miles a day but will keep up on long outings and has a good off-switch in the house. I want a dog who won\\'t rip my arm out of its socket to greet every rando it sees but one who can be trusted around strangers. My husband and I love to go to breweries and our favorites are dog friendly, so my dream is to have a dog who enjoys that sort of environment but will remain calm and content to just hang with us. We also have a cat and I know my husband will never be okay being without a cat, so I need a dog who isn\\'t likely to try and eat one. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n4)\\tWhat breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I love Keeshonden, Bearded Collies, Shetland Sheepdogs, and Silken Windhounds. Mostly because they\\'re all said to be fairly biddable and within the size range I\\'m looking for. _x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n5)\\tWhat sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I would love love love to be able to compete in obedience and get a therapy dog certification. I love teaching silly fun tricks like wave or sit up. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I don\\'t have experience in any sort of competition but I absolutely want to. Mainly I\\'m interested in obedience and rally. Maybe even FastCAT. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\*\\\\*Care Commitments\\\\*\\\\*_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I\\'d say at least 3 hours, split up throughout the day.\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  _x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* At least 2 hours of physical activity. I live in a nice area to walk around and live right across the street from a very pretty park I love to walk through. I also like to hike (nothing too strenuous, usually easy or moderate trails under 5 miles at a time) and we have so many dog-friendly trails around us that I really want to take a dog to. I\\'m not a fan of dog parks, but we do have one in my apartment complex (right across from my unit) a dog run that doesn\\'t get too crowded I would be willing to use when it\\'s otherwise empty or with a safe, friendly dog. I see it more as an opportunity for the dog to kind of sniff around outside the home while off leash in a secured area than the ideal way to burn energy off it. _x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n9)\\tHow much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\*I currently work a part time job in a grooming salon as a bather so I\\'m already brushing other peoples\\' dogs for hours every week and have no problem brushing out my own multiple times a week as needed. I have minimal experience doing full haircuts but am comfortable in trimming a dog\\'s paw pads and sanitary. If I got something that needed a more complex haircut I didn\\'t feel comfortable attempting, I would absolutely bring it in as often as needed. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\*\\\\*Personal Preferences\\\\*\\\\*_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n10)\\tWhat size dog are you looking for?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Ideally something in the medium range, like 35-50 pounds but am willing to go larger or somewhat smaller. Husband is not on board with very small breeds (has already said \"absolutely not\" to Chihuahuas)\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Shedding I\\'m fine with though I\\'m more okay with fluffy hairs or dust bunnies then the tiny stabby hairs my current short-coated dog leaves everywhere. At the risk of sounding like a freak, I feel it extremely satisfying to brush or blow out huge amounts of fluffy undercoat on a thick double coated dog. \\n\\nBarking I can handle and I realize I may be over-confident at times in my abilities but I did manage to train my once-barky mix to be, well, significantly less barky. To the point at least where she wouldn\\'t bark at any strange noise but would alert for the doorbell/a knock but would settle quickly when asked. I understand that dogs will bark and just prefer that they can be taught to tone it down or stop when called off, if that makes sense or sounds realistic? \\n\\n Slobber I would rather not have._x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Not at all important. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\*\\\\*Dog Personality and Behavior\\\\*\\\\*_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* More on the snuggly side \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Eager to please\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  _x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I would appreciate a dog who is alert but whose first response is not \"attack\". If someone is being welcomed into my home, I don\\'t need them to be exuberantly greeting them but don\\'t want to have to worry about someone getting hurt or the dog being anxious at their presence. Neutral is probably the word I\\'m looking for. \\n\\n_x000D_  \\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I want to be able to take the dog into public and to get-togethers with family who have dogs so I would rather not have one that is a potential danger to others.\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* I would really not want to deal with true separation anxiety, which I know is a concern potentially in some of the breeds I like\\n\\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\*\\\\*Lifestyle\\\\*\\\\*_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?_x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* Right now I only work 3-4 days a week because I\\'m in school, which is mostly online. With the way my schedule lines up with my husbands, the dog is looking at being alone for a maximum of maybe 5 hours a couple days a week. _x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? _x000D_  \\n_x000D_  \\n\\\\* My husband is much more of a cat person and while he is accepting of a dog, he will mainly be taking it outside on bathroom breaks and feeding it at times I cannot.

It\\'s also surprisingly well sound-proofed in that I share a living room wall with someone who has a husky I can never hear unless I\\'m outside and they have the windows open, so I\\'m not worried about getting in trouble with neighbors if I do end up with a barky dog.

TL;DR at end. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads and/or comments. Formatted on mobile. I tried to organize it in a way that makes sense. \\n\\nPicture of my dog and 19 pictures of some (not all) of the damage he’s done when left alone in the last three months [can be found here](https://imgur.com/a/ViQUkWG). Warning, there are some light bloodstains in some pictures. \\n\\n# General Background\\n\\n* My dog Khan is about 10 or 11 years old, he weighs 60lbs, and he is very loved. I adopted him a little over 4.5 years ago. The shelter said he was a black mouth mountain cur, but he’s probably mixed. All I know about his past is he was shipped up from the south like many dogs are to avoid kill shelters, and a woman had him for a month before me but gave him back because he was too clingy. \\n\\n* Khan has always been clingy, but in the past three months his separation anxiety has become very severe and keeps escalating. I’ve brought him to the vet (bloodwork was fine) and consulted with a separation anxiety behaviorist, and they both think in addition to the separation anxiety he is also suffering from canine cognitive dysfunction (dog dementia). He seems physically fine, and he has a cushioned step for my bed in case he is hiding joint pain, which he uses sometimes. He is on Prozac and Valium, details can be found below. \\n\\n* For years he was totally fine being left alone even though he was clingy. He always had free range, he’s not a crate dog. The vet and behaviorist both said a crate would make him suffer even more and I agree. \\n\\n* We live in an apartment in a city right next to a huge park and a huge dog park. My room is also pretty big. He goes to the park twice a day and goes out once more at night. When I\\'m at work he has a dogwalker who he loves. \\n\\n* We also live with a roommate who he is very bonded to, he used to sleep with her instead of me every night (heartbreaking!) until the dementia set in and she couldn\\'t handle him waking her up, now she shuts him out of her room at all times which I think stresses him out more. This all started after she went on vacation one week a month for about three months but didn\\'t stop when she came back, she\\'s been home for three months now. But she is going to be gone three weeks next month and that means he\\'s going to freak out even more than he has been the past three months when she was home. The other night she told me I should consider putting him to sleep which shocked me. Then she suggested I give him away which also shocked me. It would be so cruel to abandon a dog with abandonment issues, and I doubt anyone else would do as much as I am to help him. I love him so much, I thought she did too. I think the apartment damage is really stressing her out but I\\'m going to pay to fix it. We\\'re friends but the whole situation is becoming a source of tension. My family and co-workers also think it\\'s time. \\n\\n* For three years we lived with my exSO who he was very bonded with, but he handled the transition when we moved about 10 months ago way better than I expected. They still see each other about once a month. He frequently travels out of state for work though so he can\\'t really help out a lot. \\n\\n* Whoever trained him did a great job, I worry they were strict though because he isn’t very playful. He likes to chew on antlers and ostrich knuckles and plays with a frozen treat Kong but only for a little bit and only if we are home, he won\\'t touch them if we\\'re gone. He never destroyed anything in the past. I could leave a steak on the floor and tell him not to touch it and leave the apartment and he wouldn’t. So what I’m about to describe is very out of character. We eventually decided to get a tall thick metal gate to keep him in my room because he was so destructive to the apartment and my roommate\\'s things.\\n\\n* I work full time, but in four days (have a dogwalker as mentioned above). So three days of the week I\\'m home all day with him, I don\\'t go out and don\\'t have anyone over because that stresses him out too. Sometimes I have errands or appointments and have to leave a little bit. I used to practice leaving in short increments to desensitize him before I was told by a behaviorist that was futile because of the severity of anxiety, more details on that below. I have to practically wrestle him into my gated room before I leave, he really resists it. If I could work from home I would. \\n\\n# Symptoms\\n\\n### Separation Anxiety\\n\\n* I want to preface this by saying I value him way above the damage he has caused, and I do not punish him for it. In the past three months he has clawed/chewed up six door frames, six doors, a windowsill, a tall teal standing cabinet (and knocked it over and shredded the shreddable contents twice), a dresser, a vanity, a laundry basket, a chair, part of a vacuum cleaner, two thick metal bars from a gate, etc. I leave cardboard for him and he\\'ll chew that but it doesn\\'t prevent him from scratching up wood. I\\'m really worried he\\'s going to hurt himself, so far he\\'s split a few nails and when he ripped the bars off the gate there was blood. He also pushed my vanity into my room and the legs are unstable, so for weeks all my furniture has been clumped in a corner surrounded by barriers so he cant move it, but he still finds ways to chew and scratch it. \\n\\n* He never has accidents, but gets terrified when I take him out to pee at night and he usually refuses and drags me back to the stoop. In the daytime he doesn\\'t pee on multiple things on our walks like he used to, just pees once. He won\\'t eat or drink or play with his toys when we\\'re gone. When he panics he pants and individual drops of drool fall, by the time I get home there\\'s a huge puddle by the gate. I\\'ve filmed him before and the destruction starts as soon as I leave. Some days the Valium works better than other days and he barely destroys anything. \\n\\n* He also is not as interested in food and only eats a little bit at a time, instead of excitedly wolfing it down. He usually still likes treats though, unless he is panicking, then he refuses to eat anything. As I mentioned before he will not eat or drink alone. \\n\\n### Dementia\\n\\n* The reason he also was diagnosed with dementia is sometimes he\\'ll just stare off into space in the middle of the room and he\\'ll try to go into a different apartment than ours after walks and he panics even when I\\'m home (but is only destructive when alone), and he gets worse at night. He forgets his \"sit\" command unless the Valium works better than usual, things like that. \\n\\n* At nighttime he frequently wakes me up panicking. At his worst he\\'ll wake me up every 20 minutes, pretty much as soon as I fall back asleep. If I\\'m lucky and the Valium works better than usual it happens in two hour increments. He will be shaking and panting and have a crazy look in his eye, and he\\'ll jam his nose in my eye socket and thrust his head upward, or sit on my face or chest or step on my long hair and rip it out or straddle my chest and refuse to move trapping me, etc. I used to try taking him outside but he doesn\\'t have to pee because he just panics there too, like I described earlier. \\n\\n# Medication\\n\\n* He has been on Prozac titrating up for two months, he’s been on 60mg for about two weeks. He also gets a total of 30mg of Valium a day, split into two doses for when I’m at work and nighttime. In the past we tried Xanax and Trazodone but neither helped. He also gets strong strength dog CBD everyday. \\n\\n* The Prozac/Valium/CBD is helping a little, but not that much, and it’s clear he’s going to keep getting worse. Last time I talked to my vet she said she was out of ideas for medication but I’ll reach out to her again. I was told to see a board certified vet behaviorist, essentially a vet psychiatrist, because they have more training in the nuances of brain medication, but there are very few in the country and I was quoted $900 for a consultation which unfortunately I can’t afford. I was also told by the separation anxiety specialist that we can’t work on training him unless the medication worked because when dogs are too anxious their brains can’t create memories necessary for training. \\n\\n# Other Things I\\'ve Tried\\n\\nThings I\\'ve tried (open to ideas if you have them): \\n* Taping cardboard over the door, thick gaffe and duct tape over the door, taping a towel over the door, putting a vacuum in the way, doing a lemon/vinegar rub (this worked but caused him to move onto furniture). \\n* Various types of calming treats and a calming pheromone scent. \\n* Medication described above. \\n* Extra exercise and longs walks.\\n* Leaving a fan, lights, Bob Ross, and calming dog music playlist or long audiobook on. Leaving a frozen Kong which he won\\'t touch anymore.\\n* Thundershirt. \\n* My ex took him for three days so I could paint my dark navy room a light color which I thought might help with the nighttime anxiety but it hasn\\'t. I also spackled and painted over some of the damage but his first day back he tore the door frame up again. \\n* Getting ready to leave but sitting around, leaving in seconds to minutes increasing increments, not acknowledging or making a big deal about coming home or leaving.\\n\\n# Other Factors\\n\\n* I try really hard to be patient with him at night but the sleep deprivation is taking a toll. Unfortunately when I get woken up repeatedly I sometimes lose control of my mood and react before thinking and get frustrated with him and push him away or yell, then I feel so guilty because I know it\\'s not his fault and getting frustrated makes it worse. Full disclosure I have bipolar disorder and anxiety, I\\'m well medicated and have been for years but can\\'t take my insomnia medication anymore because him waking me up on it would make me hallucinate. \\n\\n* I\\'m trying to keep the effects on all of this on me out of my decision about when it\\'s time to let go, even though it is taking a financial (vet bills, apartment repairs, various potential remedies, etc), physical, and mental toll. The decision when/if to let go will be made with his quality of life in mind first and foremost. I just don\\'t know though. I feel bad because I know how panic attacks feel and I don\\'t know if it\\'s cruel to keep him alive when he experiences them so frequently and for so long. He is also terrified of thunderstorms and fireworks, and doesn\\'t handle heat well (for example frantically digs holes to lay in and cool down during walks despite drinking lots of water) and it\\'s getting to be that time of the year. My roommate also just dropped the bombshell that she wants to terminate the lease this September 2019 instead of 2020 like we planned, and I don\\'t think he can handle another move. I love him so much. He\\'s definitely suffering but has good moments sometimes, but the bad times are bad. He isn\\'t the dog he used to be, and I know the prognosis is his brain will keep deteriorating. \\n\\nTL;DR My senior dog has severe separation anxiety and dementia and is not responding to medication.

He stands over her panting and saucer-eyed, and if that doesn't wake her up he paws at her head. When she's awake, he'll fall peacefully back to sleep, but when she drifts off again he'll wake up and repeat.\\n\\nHe's unresponsive to my attempts to calm or console him.

I’ve tried nearly everything I can to help alleviate some of the problems that I am currently dealing with, and every single solution has turned up nothing. And so, I turn to you, hoping that you might be able to provide an answer. \\n\\nI have a two year old male corgi named Basco, who is honestly my favorite thing on this earth. He is kind, and sweet, and gentle (at least with living things), and he’s made my life feel a lot happier. But, he has had some incredibly serious behavioral issues that I cannot seem to find an explanation for. To be honest, I’m certain that somehow, I’m doing something wrong, but for the life of me, I cannot figure out what it is. I’ll go into detail on everything that has happened down below, but any and all advice you all can provide would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!\\n\\nThe issues started roughly 3 months ago. Basco has had some behavioral problems in the past, but they were mostly related to him not following commands outside of carefully controlled environments (despite lots of work with our trainer), and occasionally chewing on things. He also took nearly a year to be properly house trained. He’s an incredibly smart dog (as most corgis are), but he’s also really stubborn, and if he wants to do or to not do something, it’s his way or the highway. We actually had a previous trainer refer us to somebody else, because we went through several months of her classes and nothing about his behavior changed. His potty training has improved, and is down to around 1-2 accidents per week now, but he is still really stubborn, and lately, he has gotten incredibly destructive.\\n\\nWe recently moved to a new city for a new job of mine, and it’s my first job where I actually have to go into work, as I started work during the pandemic. I made a point to give him alone time during this period, so that way when I would eventually stop working from home, he wouldn’t have separation anxiety. When we moved to our new apartment, things started out fairly decent. However, in the past 3 months, he has cost me nearly a thousand dollars in damages, and now has to be confined to a very small part of my tiled kitchen when I am not home.\\n\\nIn the past 3 months he has destroyed: several wires, all of which should not have been in his reach, and I still to this day do not know how he got them, the legs of my coffee table, an entire couch (yes, the whole thing. It was equally impressive and frustrating. I had to throw out the couch. It was that bad), my bike, which I store indoors, a tv stand, and he has chewed his way through the bottom of my trash can, chewed a hole in my wall, and has annihilated my carpet to the point that I have to pay to re-carpet my entire apartment. He has also chewed and bent the electrical heating units along my baseboards in several places. Not sure what they’re properly called, but it’s the white metal bars that run along the wall near the floor in place of heating by ventilation. He also is not allowed to have dog beds, as he destroys them within minutes, and has even bent the bars of his kennel!\\n\\nAt first, I thought he was just confused or anxious about the new environment. So I made a point about slowly introducing him to new parts of my apartment. I know corgis have a lot of energy, so I make a point of working with him daily to get that out. We go to a doggie day care twice a week in the mornings so he can run and play with other dogs, and the other three days of the week, we either go on walks around my neighborhood or play indoors for at least an hour before I leave for work. (For context, I work 1-9pm, Monday-Friday) I also make sure to do several puzzle toys with him before I leave, and I leave him with a frozen kong of treats and two of those snuffle mat things with hidden treats while I’m at work. I also make sure to leave the tv on, either set to one of those 10 hour doggie TV videos or a long YouTube playlist. I also make time every day before I leave for work to practice commands with him, though if I’m being honest, progress in that department has been pretty poor. We also see a trainer on the weekends, and I make a point about following her directions exactly. \\n\\nBecause of my hours going late, I can’t just leave him at daycare all day, as every daycare within a 50 mile radius of me closes by 6pm, and my hours aren’t really something that I can change due to the nature of my job. The daycare nearest us does allow us to visit for a few hours during the week, (for a fee) which I am highly appreciative of. I’ve also tried using bitter apple sprays as a chew repellant, as well as a vinegar based chew repellant spray that I found online, and neither of these have any effect. I’m honestly convinced my dog doesn’t have taste buds, as neither of these sprays seem to prevent him at all from destroying stuff. Obviously, when I see him engaging in this behavior at home, I make a point of interrupting him, but he doesn’t really seem to learn anything by it, as his behavior there hasn’t changed in the past few months. I also make sure to buy him plenty of new toys to keep his interest, as he pretty much refuses to play with any toy that is more than a week old. \\n\\nHonestly, I’m at a total loss here. My trainer is out of ideas, I’m out of ideas, and as a result, it’s gotten to the point where I have to leave my poor Bosco in a pen, in the middle of my tiled kitchen floor, the entire time I’m at work. (To be clear, this is a recent development. I spent most of the past few months letting him roam the apartment and trying to solve the problem without confining him.) I came home today to find that he had somehow torn up a tile from my floor, meaning that I am now going to have to repair that. I honestly don’t even know how this is possible. I love my dog and truly want to give him the best home possible, and I genuinely want to solve this problem, but I have no clue where to start. So, I ask you, Reddit - what am I doing wrong? Am I getting bad advice? Could I be doing more? Any and all help is appreciated.

Even so, it doesn\\'t make the decision easier...the lab we were fostering for my SO\\'s brother passed away from kidney failure just two months ago...going through the grief of losing another member of our \"pack\" so soon is just so difficult to consider...\\n\\nI adopted my old chihuahua, Monty, just over 3 years ago, from a wonderful rescue that rescues senior dogs and cats from shelters to give them a chance at having a loving home for whatever amount of time they still have. Monty never acted like a dog. Never interested in our other dogs. Never played. I\\'m not sure if he was in the beginning stages of canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) aka \"doggy dementia\" or if he simply was never treated like a dog. Either way, over the last year or so, he started showing clear signs of CCD. It started with him just standing in front of a mirror or window and staring. Then, he started walking in circles. He lost all ability to find his way outside (or back in), which meant constantly cleaning up after him. We finally had to secure him in one area of the bedroom whenever we leave the house because he will wander someplace and get \"stuck,\" then start screaming in frustration. A few months ago I had to start helping him eat, because he can no longer maintain his balance enough to stand long enough in one place to eat. We have to help him drink water because he usually can\\'t find the bowl, or can\\'t balance enough to drink from it. But he does know when it\\'s dinner time, and demands it! And, he wants to be around us, so when we\\'re home, he wanders in his circular way to follow wherever we go. His \"awareness\" of us, and his interest in food, have kept me from making the decision to let him go. But, the last few months, we had to switch him to a bland diet of chicken and rice because anything and everything gave him diarrhea. But then he started refusing to eat it (I suspect he\\'s losing almost all his senses, so the bland diet is simply too bland). The ONLY thing he will eat now is roasted chicken. And, that gives him diarrhea. So, yes, he\\'s eating. But he\\'s losing weight because he cannot sustain himself on what he will eat. He\\'s down to 5 pounds (was 8 pounds a year ago). Under all his fluff, he\\'s a skeleton. But, he still demands his food. He still follows us. And so, I\\'m tormented with the decision I must make. I will be going out of town for a week at the end of October. I have already decided that I won\\'t put my SO through having to care for poor Monty on his own, in addition to our other 2 dogs, especially since I have no idea how Monty will react in his declined mental state to my absence (I\\'m Monty\\'s \"person\" and when he\\'s upset, I can calm him by laying him on my chest). So, the latest I will wait is mid-October. But every single day I wonder if I am waiting too long. Or am I trying to justify making the decision because I am so very exhausted (physically, mentally and emotionally)? \\n\\nI\\'m not looking for answers...I know this is a personal decision that only I can make.

I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

Struggling to determine when we’re “a week early” rather than “a day late” to euthanasia. \\nI have a 13-year-old Newfoundland/German Shepherd mix. He is a sweet, gentle giant and we are honoured to be his family. \\n\\nHe has had various health issues since we adopted him at age 7. Despite receiving treatment for arthritis, tie back surgery for laryngeal paralysis/GOLPP, canine cognitive dysfunction, removal of a malignant tumour on his lip, and other ailments, he’s been struggling more recently. He finds it hard to stand and use stairs at times, and gets tired quickly on short walks. He also has spells of confusion and distress at night, panting and pacing for hours, and pants frequently during the day.\\n\\nWe’ve tried medications like metacam, gabapentin, and glucosamine, which he still takes daily, but with debatable improvement. He loves winter due to his thick coat but REALLY struggles in the summer, even with every cooling tip we have tried.

If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**\\n\\n*No, I have owned a Cane Corso, American Pitbull Terrier and a GSD Mix. All of my dogs were trained in basic obedience (Sit, Stay, Down, Recall, loose lead walking)*\\n\\n**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**\\n\\n*I just lost my Cane Corse to Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and my APBT to bone cancer within a year of each other. They were 10 and 9, respectively. So, I'll be going the reputable breeder route to minimize any health issues moving forward.*\\n\\n**Describe your ideal dog.**\\n\\n*My dream dog is medium - X- Large, minimal-moderate shedding, easily trainable, happy on a hike or in the house for a movie night. They will accompany me almost everywhere, other than work.*\\n\\n**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**\\n\\n*My dream breed is a Dutch Shepherd, they are the most beautiful breed I've ever seen. Unfortunately, my research has built up some fear of not being able to sufficiently meet the breeds physical exercise requirements, (From my understanding, they are like Malinois level energizer bunnies that just go and go) and I've also read that they do not enjoy cuddling after a days work, which is something I absolutely need in a breed lol.*\\n\\n*This has led me to lean towards the GSD breed. I do not particularly like the look of the showline GSD, but their temperament and exercise requirements seem to be exactly what I need. I LOVE the look of the dark sable working line shepherds, with the more square structure and healthier hips / elbows, but I have the same hesitations that come with the Dutch Shepherds regarding the 23.5hrs a day of exercise required to make them happy lol.*\\n\\n*I also feel like the Doberman could be ideal for me, but their breed-specific health issues seem way too common. Kind of scares me, do NOT want another dog to get sick on me.*\\n\\n**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**\\n\\n*Advanced Obedience (Strict heel, down, stay, sit, place, recall, off-lead obedience for hikes), I will be putting a TON of time and energy into the socialization of my pup so he can go to lots of places with me and be comfortable and happy, and, potentially some bite and scent work training that could translate into IPO-style dog sports for fun.*\\n\\n**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**\\n\\n*This is a possibilty down the road when I think he's bored with our normal training routines. I have 0 experience in this field, however.*\\n\\nCare Commitments\\n\\n**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**\\n\\n*I will be doing about 30-60 mins of obedience training, 60-90mins of physcial play, 2-3 walks about 2 miles each, and as much socialization I can each day. At home, my family will be interacting with him nonstop (light play indoors, cuddling, etc.)*\\n\\n**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**\\n\\n*an hour - hour and a half of physical exercise is a realistic number I can hit daily (more on weekends as I go for hikes or walk through state parks on saturday mornings), I also calculate mental and physical exercise as separate activities, so we will also be doing another 30/60 mins of mental exercise via obedience training and puzzles. This includes walks around the neghborhood, playing in our fenced backyard, going to any of the local parks, hiking, etc.*\\n\\n*I will NOT be using a dog park. I have seen way too many untrained dogs at dog parks that just become a danger to have around my pups. my pit was attacked at a dog park, it took me years to make her comfortable around strange dogs again. We will walk through dog parks, but we will not be going into the kennel areas and going off leash for unstructured play with strange dogs.*\\n\\n**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**\\n\\n*I'd prefer a brushing once or twice a week, cleaning ears is fine with me, but I do not want to have to pay a groomer for constant haircuts.*\\n\\nPersonal Preferences\\n\\n**10) What size dog are you looking for?**\\n\\n*Medium to large but Extra Large is also fine with me.*\\n\\n**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**\\n\\n*My Cane Corso slobbered me out, I am now looking for as little drool as I can get while maintaining some of the traits I need. He will be my going everywhere he’s allowed to with me, so slobbering can make people uncomfortable in public or at BBQ's or something lol.*\\n\\n**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**\\n\\n*I would love to be able to keep my dog off-lead whenever it is safe to do so. I'd say very important.*\\n\\nDog Personality and Behavior\\n\\n**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**\\n\\n*I actually love both of these personalities. My APBT was a snuggle bug, while my Cane Corso would get up and go lay across the room after a few minutes of petting. If I had to choose, I'd say I prefer a snuggly dog.*\\n\\n**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**\\n\\n*Eagerness to please is a necessity for my plans with my pup.*\\n\\n**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**\\n\\n*I would prefer for the dog to have guarding instincts, for sure. I have a son who plays in my yard and If a stranger enters my yard, they should know IMMEDIATELY  that they are not welcome. (My Corso was EXCEPTIONAL at this, while my Pit just wanted to love on everyone she saw lol). Knocking on my door -- I'd prefer an alert bark. The dog will be put into a place while I answer the door.*\\n\\n**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**\\n\\n*I hope, with the amount of socialization I'd be working on through puppyhood, that this wouldn't be an issue but, if it was, I would absolutely put the work in to fix this behaviour.*\\n\\n**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**\\n\\n*The way people talk about Huskies just bolting over fences or out of doors because they want to roam seems like an absolute nightmare. Insanely high prey drive is also something I'd like to avoid, as I live in an area that has a LOT of rabbits and small dogs walking around with their owners.*\\n\\nLifestyle\\n\\n**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**\\n\\n*The dog will be alone for 4-6hrs, 2-3 times a week.*\\n\\n**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**\\n\\n*Minimal-Moderate shedding, she will be prepping the dogs meals sometimes and playing / training with him often.*\\n\\n**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**\\n\\n*Unfortunately, no, not anymore.*\\n\\n**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**\\n\\n*Yes, I have a son (2 yrs old) and we spend a lot of time around family members ranging from 3 yrs old to 13 yrs old. I worked with my pit, who would get over excited when she saw my son and I am aware of the rough play risk a dog can pose. I am willing and able to work around this.*\\n\\n**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**\\n\\n*Never renting again.*\\n\\n**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**\\n\\n*I live in PA, USA, North America, Earth. No breed restrictions.*\\n\\n**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**\\n\\n*Peak Summer: \\\\\\\\\\\\~85 F, Peak winter: \\\\\\\\\\\\~30 F*\\n\\nAdditional Information and Questions\\n\\n**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**\\n\\n*I have a 2yr old son, a half acre yard surrounded by 6ft fences. There are many parks around me that are dog friendly.*\\n\\n*I have experience dealing with trouble behaviors (ex. my Cane Corso had crazy resource guarding and food aggression when we first got him).*\\n\\n*I'm looking for a dog that can go on hikes with me, but also chill at family functions for extended periods of time. I also want to be able to train to very high levels of obedience.*\\n\\n**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**\\n\\n*I feel like the working line GSD would require far too much exercise than I could realistically provide, but I have no in-person experience with them.*\\n\\n*Based on my information provided, does any one with working line GSD experience think I could provide the stimulation that would let them live a happy and fulfilled life?*\\n\\n*Is there a breed out there (that isn't a poodle) that actually fits all of the things I'm looking for?*\\n\\nThank you for reading all of this, looking forward to hearing your recommendations!\\n\\nEdit: I removed any misused terms to avoid further issues.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 2, 'content': 'Manic licking of former bandaged paw and aggressive behavior\\nI am coming to you out of desperation with our beloved dog amy. I am trying to compress a long story as much as possible:\\n\\nWe have a female mixed breed rescue dog, weighing just about 10kg (22lbs). She is neutered and has been living with us for 4.5 years now. Up until now we had no behavioral issues and she integrated very well in our daily lives. The household consists of two adults, no kids, no other pets. No Medication or known issues.\\n\\nUnfortunately on 2nd January 2025 she had an accident were a heavy object fell on her paw and injured it. She suffered a small fracture on a toe and has an open wound between two toes. We immediately went to a veterinary clinic. There she was x-rayed and examined. The fracture was seen as a minor issue that should heal on its own (this was later confirmed by an orthopedic surgeon), the cut was the more severe problem. The wound was cleaned and the foot was bandaged, no stitches were applied. The bandages were changed daily. She used the foot normally after that, no change in behavior was seen by us, we did only very short walks (about 3x 10 minutes/day).\\n\\nA week later the wound was examined again under sedation since she showed new signs of pain and was then stitched up. Pain medication was increased.\\n\\nThe (multiple) vets we saw say that the foot slowly needs to come out of the bandage for the wound to heal properly. Unfortunately amy starts to manically lick the paw as soon as she has any access to it. Muzzles or cones did not help (she is trained on both) and she reacts with unseen aggression to any attempt to stop her from licking. She growls loudly and snaps at my hands if i come close to the paw when she is licking it. Only getting her bandaged again at the vet stopped that behaviour.\\n\\nWe are now desperately looking for any insights or experience on how to keep a dog from licking the paw after it, this is our guess, now seems like a foreign object since it changed in smell and feel under the bandage. Especially when cones or muzzles are no option because she fights them violently.\\n\\nAll of this happened under close supervision of multiple vets, we are very certain that there are no other issues with the paw other then the aforementioned.\\n\\nThanks for any insights or ideas.

I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 0, 'content': \"My Girl (5Y) Died of Cancer 8 Months Ago—Need Help Finding a Breed that Suits Me and Info on How to Avoid Significant Health Issues.  \\nHello Everyone! I'm sorry for being another annoying breed recommendation post, but I'd really love the help of more knowledgeable people in looking on what breed fits my lifestyle and some recommendations for further research.\\n\\n  \\n**Introduction**\\n\\n1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\\n   * No. I've had dogs all my life. My girl, Bean, was the first puppy I've ever owned and trained (very successfully; she was often mistaken for a service dog due to how well she followed commands and her attention to her handler, me). However, I have lived with dogs my entire life. \\n2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a\\xa0[reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?\\n   * I've never purchased a dog and would like to rescue, but I am afraid of potential health issues  like Bean's, which is forcing me to consider purchasing a puppy from a reputable breeder with proven healthy lineages. \\n3. Describe your ideal dog.\\n   * I'd love a cuddly dog, handler-focused, clingy, and energetic but not so much as a working breed. I also LOVE dogs with goofy personalities, but that's more specific to the dog and less to a breed, I assume. \\n4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\\n   * Aesthetically, I love Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Anatolian Shepards, Rottweilers, and American Alsatians (which I recently heard are BYB dogs, which really put a damper on things, since they sounded pretty perfect to me). I just LOVE a huge dog with a big ole head and floppy ears. I also love Pitties/Bullies, but I can't really narrow it down to one specific breed, since I've only ever had pittie mix rescues. I just don't know enough about breed standards to provide a standard I'm interested in. I don't typically like curly haired breeds.\\n5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\\n   * Basic obedience and possibly dog sports, if the breed has more intense enrichment needs. This would be a companion dog, not a working dog.\\n6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\\n   * No desire/need to compete or have the dog work, but I'm willing to do anything to meet my dog's needs.\\n\\n**Care Commitments**\\n\\n7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\\n\\n   * At least an hour to two hours a day, but I was planning on leaving them at training/ doggy daycare while I work so that they get appropriate enrichment time. I enjoy training, playing, and walking with my dog and would love a dog that can both do that and also is happy to lay in bed with me on a lazy sunday. \\n\\n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?\\n\\n   * I volunteer at my local shelter and have done animal handling training, which makes me believe that dog parks are unnecessarily dangerous to dogs and can put undue stress on them because of the mixed playstyles and constant rotation of new players. I will not be doing dog parks. I like nature walks, short hikes, taking my dog out on the town (to dog-friendly areas), and I have a large backyard. I'd also walk them at least once a day on top of our outdoor time. \\n\\n9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\\n\\n   * I can groom regularly at home but am much more likely to pay a professional. My Bean was a short-haired bully mix and got groomed every 2-3 weeks. I love long-haired dogs but am afraid they'll overheat (Florida). \\n\\n**Personal Preferences**\\n\\n10) What size dog are you looking for?\\n\\n   * L-XL breeds. The bigger the better so long as their average lifespan is above 10. \\n\\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\\n\\n   * All of it. No such thing as too much from my baby. I deep clean regularly.\\n\\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\\n\\n   * Not at all. I have a fenced backyard and never let my dog off-leash in public due to danger from people or other dogs' behavior. \\n\\n**Dog Personality and Behavior**\\n\\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\\n\\n   * Snugglebug. \\n\\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?\\n\\n   * Either is fine. \\n\\n15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?\\n\\n   * Friendly is preferred, but Aloof is fine. I would not like a dog breed prone to reactivity. Of course, I will be training and de-sensitizing, but there are some more prone to reactivity than others, as you know.\\n\\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\\n\\n   * No. I would prefer that they are either ambivalent or dog-friendly, as I work with many dogs and would like to continue fostering.\\n\\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?\\n\\n   * High prey drive cannot be a factor, I have two cats and foster. I would prefer if they were friendly to small animals or felt the need to protect them, as my deceased baby did. \\n\\n**Lifestyle**\\n\\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\\n\\n   * Almost never. There is almost always someone home, but I will be the sole caretaker. \\n\\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?\\n\\n   * I will be the sole caretaker. The others can let them out to use the bathroom in the backyard, but I will be taking full care of the dog. They have no specific preferences outside of wanting a dog that will not harm other dogs or cats.\\n\\n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?

Now, this is 1-1.25 years from when she really started showing clearer dementia symptoms (starting to whimper for no reason, starting to pace a bit aimlessly, neurological weakness in her hind legs, being unsettled more). However, even before that, the subtle symptoms  began around 2 years ago (age 13-14 or so). Those symptoms are like your Pom\\'s current symptoms. My sweet girl, who used to let us carry her around like a baby in our arms, and who used to be excited to meet every single stranger she came across (when younger she worked as a therapy dog visiting patients in long term elderly care) , started showing aggression to my spouse and I. She would growl when we approached her face for snuggles, occasionally bite us, starting forgetting her tricks (she used to know a ton), stopped wanting to be handled as much yet was still clingy, starting walking past our house and not recognizing it, spent more time by herself etc. It was a change in character that we initially chalked up to old age or slight body pains. At that time, we got her x-rayed, full body examined, blood panel, etc and she had a clean bill of health so we knew her change in demeanor was not due to pain at that moment. But 2 years later, now today, our girl is very deep and clearly into the late stages of dementia. She now walks in circles, gets stuck behind furniture, can no longer solve food puzzles shes had her whole life and used to previously crush with ease, doesnt seek our attention, and seemingly has lost her volition/intent in her actions...shes almost like a passenger in her own body and no longer in control...I\\'ve been accepting that her time with us is coming to end. \\n\\nI wish I had recognized her symptoms earlier, when they first began. It was only about 1 year ago when my vet and I started coming up with a gameplan in terms of supplements/treatment/medication to help slow the dementia down. CCD will 100 percent progress in its severity, but the rate of which may be slowed if you take action. Even so, while we had managed her dementia well for the last 6 months, it still took a sudden turn for the worse this last week, even though we have continued the same program. Its the unfortunate nature of this terrible disease. \\n\\nMy advice for u is to ensure that you are treating all the possible causations that are possibly due to pain (make sure her dental is good, and that she has treatment for arthritis if she has that, have her ears examined for infections etc), and if that doesn\\'t change your dogs demeanor, you should start thinking about dementia as the causation. If your vet is not familiar with CCD, and many are not, change vets. Many vets just think its anxiety, and prescribe meds for those symptoms. I had to find a vet that understood CCD and that would prescribe me Anipryl/Selegeline, which is the only FDA approved drug to treat CCD in dogs. Our girl is also on senilife supplement.  That being said, the most helpful for us has been the introduction of Gabapentin, which both calms her anxiety and helps with pain  If you want a great resource on this topic, considering reading Eileen Anderson\\'s book \"Remember Me.\"  It consolidates a lot of info about dementia in dogs. My vet also provided me with great summary about other potential  drugs/supps that we should try throughout this journey. DM me and I\\'ll forward to you. \\n\\nThe tough part about dogs at this age is that there are often comorbidities. Their vision can be getting worse, there hearing is diminishing, and in turn that also affects their ability to interact with the environment and keep their brain stimulated and strong. My girl got worse as she became more deaf, and more recently her vision has gotten worse which also seems to have made her symptoms worse. She started having more accidents in the house, not only because of her dementia, but also because she started showing signs of kidney disease at age 15.  If you can, try to keep your dog engaged with exercise, training, or some other mental stimulation, to the extent that she is comfortable doing so...studies show that dogs on dementia meds do even better when they have exercise/stimulation. Lastly, please baby proof their environment. Consider putting down yoga mats for traction throughout the house.  As dogs progress in dementia, they started doing wild Sh\\\\*t they never would have done before. My girl who used to train agility, would now face plant jumping off sidewalk curbs because she couldn\\'t judge distance anymore. She also zoomied straight into a wall the other day.  My first dog that had dementia who passed 4 years ago, jumped through the rungs of our 2nd story railing, he survived but it clearly was not good for him.  Lastly, be patient with your pup and yourself and dont be too hard on yourself. Realize that none of the things your dog is doing, is out of spite or within their control, and realize that there will be bumps along the way and that you are doing the best you can to control the things within your reach.

After a few weeks of this, he started to become reactive when I got close to him so I stopped the medication. Luckily, it’s summer and he no longer has dry eyes. \\n\\nIn the past few months, he’s become more and more aggressive towards me, my boyfriend and everyone that he knows. It’s to the point where I can’t even put his leash on without him biting my hands. I’m not sure if it’s to do with being upset about the past treatment plan, but I’m also starting to wonder if it’s dementia/cognitive decline. \\n\\nHe seems upset and confused most of the day and was the most cuddly dog in the past. \\n\\nHe still eats normally, uses the washroom outside, does tricks (on some days) and knows his way to the park. He’s friendly with other dogs on the street but barely walks- he’s incredibly slow and has trouble turning corners. I can see his legs shaking but if I pick him up, he’ll bark loudly in my arms and try his best to bite me. \\n\\nAt night, he lays in bed and barks as if someone is there when I’m in the other room. I try to calm him down but he threatens to attack me so I just try to leave him alone. He also stopped letting my boyfriend get near him even though he’s been in his life since he was a puppy. \\n\\nI took him to the vet, he thinks the sudden aggression is to do with pain, arthritis and cognitive decline. He mentioned the main signs of dementia are things like house soiling, pacing, forgetting where his dish his but he doesn’t do any of those things. \\nInstead, he just has a total change of character- more aggressive, reactive, doesn’t want to be touched/looked at. \\n\\nAll of my friends think it’s time to euthanize him because he’s a completely different dog than he was a year ago, but I’m honestly not sure if this is a case of negative conditioning from his past treatment or if he is seriously confused/in pain. \\n\\nIf you could please let me know your thoughts/experiences with senior dogs with CCD I would greatly appreciate it. \\n\\nI don’t want to euthanize a healthy dog that is just upset, but I also don’t want to make him live in pain if that’s the case. \", 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 10, 'content': \"Vet Told Me My Health 3 Year Old Cat Will Need All of Her Teeth Pulled\\n**TLDR**: My cat went in for a dental cleaning, and six teeth were pulled. She’s healthy, her bloodwork is perfect, and she has no preexisting conditions. The vet told me she would have all of her teeth pulled eventually because of an “overactive immune system” with no additional explanation. This is my first cat, and I need to know what the next steps are.\\n\\nMy cat is almost three years old, a domestic shorthair, and has never had any chronic health issues. She stays inside full time, is up to date on all vaccines, has annual exams and preventative blood work, is negative for FEL-V/DIV/heartworms, eats grain-free food (PURINA ONE Indoor Advantage), we use Revolution for heartworm/flea/tick, and she eats a few Greenies most days. The only health issue she’s had was an injection site reaction, which resolved without any surgical intervention.\\n\\nI wanted to get her teeth cleaned last year, and the vet told me it would be overkill because she didn’t have any plaque or tartar, and her bloodwork was perfect. I took her in for her annual exam a few weeks ago and told the vet that her breath was starting to smell and that I’d like to have her teeth cleaned before it became an issue. When we went over the estimate, there was a section noting extractions, and the vet told me the odds of her needing anything extracted were extremely low because she was showing no signs of issues with her teeth or gums.\\n\\nI scheduled the appointment and took her in on Thursday. I got a call from the surgeon a few hours later, and they told me she needed to extract 6 teeth, and I needed to decide immediately because she was under anesthesia. I asked if there were any other options (my mind was blown by the idea of her having that many teeth removed and not having time to think it through), and she said, “Steroids, but you can’t do it long term. It’s a bacterial infection.” When I asked what would cause this, she told me that while my cat had very little plaque or tartar, her gums were inflamed (the opposite of what I’d been told a few weeks ago), and she would eventually need to have all of her teeth pulled.\\xa0\\n\\nI decided to let them pull the six teeth because I felt like I was under the gun, and I didn’t want her to be in pain or sick. When I went to pick her up, I asked to speak with someone about what was going on with her teeth that would have caused this, and the surgeon came out and was … caustic. They refused to tell me anything beyond that my cat will eventually be toothless, and I’ll need to get her teeth cleaned twice a year or more, and I should expect to pay for extractions every time.\\xa0\\n\\nI asked what was going on with a bacterial infection and if she needed antibiotics. She said no. She also told me that wet food was optional (she usually eats kibble), which felt odd to me when she’d had 6 teeth pulled, but I don’t know anything about feline dental care, so I accepted it. FWIW, I did put her on wet food.\\n\\nI took her home, and we’ve been on a strict schedule with Onsior (3 days), gabapentin (2x/day), and now Enulose (2x/day). She’s been able to use her litter box and is starting to behave like her normal self again (making biscuits, jumping on furniture, etc). She is eating (I don't know how to compare the wet food consumption to her usual kibble, but she seems ok) and just started drinking water again last night.\\n\\nI understand that I’m probably coming off like an insane pet owner right now. I’m in STEM, so everything is quantifiable to me (lol). I played the recording of the surgeon to my friend, who’s worked in vet clinics for decades, and she told me the entire interaction felt off and I should get a second opinion ASAP. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but the clinic she went to is one of many under the same umbrella company (VetSavers). I spoke with a friend about it, and she told me her cat has this issue, and it’s called stomatitis.\\xa0\\n\\nMy real question is what my next steps should be. I scheduled an appointment with a different vet for a second opinion, signed up for pet insurance (Embrace), and looked into stomatitis. I have no idea what I’m doing here, and the amount of information out there about “this cured my cat” is too vast for me to sift through. I’m not a “let’s start this supplement!” without consulting with a vet, and I’m skeptical about anything that hasn’t been proven scientifically.\\xa0Notably, I'm a grad student, and my budget is limited, but if I have enough time to plan for it, I can make it work.\\n\\nAny advice or ideas would be appreciated.

This is my first dog and I am not fully versed in breeding and how genetics in dogs actually really work. \\n\\nBefore I got him I did my research, talked to the breeder numerous times and met his mother and the other dogs in her home. Everything seemed really great. The parents are both health tested and have great scores, have great titles from championship as they are working line labradors. His dad was flown in from Ireland to breed. Online I could find a generational heritage line going back 5 generations. No information about health testing for the older ones but I could probably find out if I really wanted to. The only “issue” I could find was that the dad  has a 3/7 hip dysphasia score. I don’t even really know what that means. I met the puppies 3 times and everything seemed great as a first time dog owner.  My puppy was the most aloof and very independent at 9 weeks old. The breeder picked him for me saying “you’re young, you can handle a challenge” i still wonder if I should have just said no to that. \\n\\nMy dog has so many issues. I love him more than anything and we have worked hard on his issues. Now we are finally after 3 years getting to a good place with his training and his temperament. He has chronic gastritis which my vet believes resulted in high anxiety as we couldn’t figure out at first why he has so many stomach issues. He’s now on a hyperallergenic diet and doing well but during the crucial months when he was younger I didn’t know what was wrong with him even after many vet appointments. This led to him being very reactive to strangers interacting with him. Which shouldn’t be the case in a well bred Labrador. He would lunge and growl at strangers who looked at him a bit too long or tried to speak to me (not even him). This period of time was hard and isolating for me. I spent thousands on trainers and dog schools but it didn’t change much. This started at 12 weeks old and got worse as he got older. After no progress with trainers. I started to simply challenge him with new situation and heavily rewarding good behavior. Slowly he got more confident and I can now take him with me to restaurants and meet new people with almost no issues. But it took a long time and was emotionally really hard for me as he is also a big dog and I’m a small ish woman; so his reactions were scary for everyone involved. I still have a lot of management i need to do in certain situation for him to succeed. \\n\\nAround 1 1/2 - 2 years old his behavior  outside got worse. Constant pulling, obsessive sniffing to the point where he would take me down If I tried to walk him away from a spot he wanted to sniff badly. I have been injured by him pulling me down the stairs or just the constant pulling hurting my Shoulders, knees etc. \\nTook him to many trainers, they all said it was teenage behavior which I knew wasnt true. Only 1 trainer said that he has never seen behavior like his in a lab and doesn’t really know how to fix it. He’s a smart dog and likes to learn but after more than 10.000€ spent dog trainers and vet appointments he still can’t walk on a loose leash?? I knew something was wrong with him. \\n\\nAfter being dismissed by so many trainers and vets about his “teenage boy behavior” I just decided to neuter him and hope for a change. So I found a better vet who listened and found out he is hypersexual and had a massively large prostate. Now he’s been neutered and he’s so much more calm, less nervous and less reactive. Great recall, great off leash. It’s like all our hard work finally clicked in his brain. \\nI also found out he has mild hip dysplasia. Nothing serious for now but not great for when he gets older. \\n\\nI love my dog. He is my whole world. But he’s a mess. Most people would have given up on him and after a particularly bad day I thought about it too. This working dog could never  be used for hunting, I could barely walk him for a long time. So my question is: considering all of his issues, how can he be from a good breeder? Am I morally obligated to tell my breeder Incase she breeds his parents again? \\nDid I just get unlucky or does it have to be genetic? He’s deeply loved and exceptionally well taken care off and never encountered anything actually scary that could explain his behavior. \\n\\nSorry for the super long text but this has been bugging me for a while now. Any answers are very appreciated.

The vet has been hesitant to do so the last year or so because of his age. We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. \\n\\nBecause of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath. We tried all sorts of vet recommended supplements/meds to help with the pacing to no avail and now are moving onto an $85 bag of prescription hard dog food said to help with CCD, which I’ll need to soften and likely blend because of his teeth. They don’t make it in a soft food. \\n\\nHe tries to bite me anytime I pick him up to go up/down stairs. So at least twice a day he’s super mad at me. Yet all I want to do it pet his ears and snuggle. It’s been exhausting the last few months. Saying all this makes it sound like he’s miserable. I’m sure sometimes he is but most of the time he still seems to be a happy dog. He does adorable laps around the house when I get home. Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack. One of my favorite things is when he’s eating and his tail does a couple little wags…reminds me of a little kid dancing cause their food is good. \\n\\nI feel really torn on taking on the expense and risk of the dental, assuming he’s clearly for it by the cardiologist. Putting his little body through anesthesia seems like a lot. And as shitty as it feels to say, spending nearly $2000 for a dog at the top of his age expectancy is a lot. The vet and I spent a long time talking recently. The conclusion is there’s no right or wrong answer on how I should proceed, either try to keep him comfortable until it’s time (cause I don’t think we’re at that point yet) or try to be aggressive with treatment. \\n\\nHe’s my little buddy and I hate the feeling that I’m going to pick poorly, that his time is running out, and that he might be in pain.

Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

So, I'll be going the reputable breeder route to minimize any health issues moving forward.*\\n\\n**Describe your ideal dog.**\\n\\n*My dream dog is medium - X- Large, minimal-moderate shedding, easily trainable, happy on a hike or in the house for a movie night. They will accompany me almost everywhere, other than work.*\\n\\n**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**\\n\\n*My dream breed is a Dutch Shepherd, they are the most beautiful breed I've ever seen. Unfortunately, my research has built up some fear of not being able to sufficiently meet the breeds physical exercise requirements, (From my understanding, they are like Malinois level energizer bunnies that just go and go) and I've also read that they do not enjoy cuddling after a days work, which is something I absolutely need in a breed lol.*\\n\\n*This has led me to lean towards the GSD breed. I do not particularly like the look of the showline GSD, but their temperament and exercise requirements seem to be exactly what I need. I LOVE the look of the dark sable working line shepherds, with the more square structure and healthier hips / elbows, but I have the same hesitations that come with the Dutch Shepherds regarding the 23.5hrs a day of exercise required to make them happy lol.*\\n\\n*I also feel like the Doberman could be ideal for me, but their breed-specific health issues seem way too common. Kind of scares me, do NOT want another dog to get sick on me.*\\n\\n**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**\\n\\n*Advanced Obedience (Strict heel, down, stay, sit, place, recall, off-lead obedience for hikes), I will be putting a TON of time and energy into the socialization of my pup so he can go to lots of places with me and be comfortable and happy, and, potentially some bite and scent work training that could translate into IPO-style dog sports for fun.*\\n\\n**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**\\n\\n*This is a possibilty down the road when I think he's bored with our normal training routines. I have 0 experience in this field, however.*\\n\\nCare Commitments\\n\\n**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**\\n\\n*I will be doing about 30-60 mins of obedience training, 60-90mins of physcial play, 2-3 walks about 2 miles each, and as much socialization I can each day. At home, my family will be interacting with him nonstop (light play indoors, cuddling, etc.)*\\n\\n**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**\\n\\n*an hour - hour and a half of physical exercise is a realistic number I can hit daily (more on weekends as I go for hikes or walk through state parks on saturday mornings), I also calculate mental and physical exercise as separate activities, so we will also be doing another 30/60 mins of mental exercise via obedience training and puzzles. This includes walks around the neghborhood, playing in our fenced backyard, going to any of the local parks, hiking, etc.*\\n\\n*I will NOT be using a dog park. I have seen way too many untrained dogs at dog parks that just become a danger to have around my pups. my pit was attacked at a dog park, it took me years to make her comfortable around strange dogs again. We will walk through dog parks, but we will not be going into the kennel areas and going off leash for unstructured play with strange dogs.*\\n\\n**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**\\n\\n*I'd prefer a brushing once or twice a week, cleaning ears is fine with me, but I do not want to have to pay a groomer for constant haircuts.*\\n\\nPersonal Preferences\\n\\n**10) What size dog are you looking for?**\\n\\n*Medium to large but Extra Large is also fine with me.*\\n\\n**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**\\n\\n*My Cane Corso slobbered me out, I am now looking for as little drool as I can get while maintaining some of the traits I need. He will be my going everywhere he’s allowed to with me, so slobbering can make people uncomfortable in public or at BBQ's or something lol.*\\n\\n**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**\\n\\n*I would love to be able to keep my dog off-lead whenever it is safe to do so. I'd say very important.*\\n\\nDog Personality and Behavior\\n\\n**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**\\n\\n*I actually love both of these personalities. My APBT was a snuggle bug, while my Cane Corso would get up and go lay across the room after a few minutes of petting. If I had to choose, I'd say I prefer a snuggly dog.*\\n\\n**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**\\n\\n*Eagerness to please is a necessity for my plans with my pup.*\\n\\n**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**\\n\\n*I would prefer for the dog to have guarding instincts, for sure. I have a son who plays in my yard and If a stranger enters my yard, they should know IMMEDIATELY  that they are not welcome. (My Corso was EXCEPTIONAL at this, while my Pit just wanted to love on everyone she saw lol). Knocking on my door -- I'd prefer an alert bark. The dog will be put into a place while I answer the door.*\\n\\n**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**\\n\\n*I hope, with the amount of socialization I'd be working on through puppyhood, that this wouldn't be an issue but, if it was, I would absolutely put the work in to fix this behaviour.*\\n\\n**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**\\n\\n*The way people talk about Huskies just bolting over fences or out of doors because they want to roam seems like an absolute nightmare. Insanely high prey drive is also something I'd like to avoid, as I live in an area that has a LOT of rabbits and small dogs walking around with their owners.*\\n\\nLifestyle\\n\\n**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**\\n\\n*The dog will be alone for 4-6hrs, 2-3 times a week.*\\n\\n**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**\\n\\n*Minimal-Moderate shedding, she will be prepping the dogs meals sometimes and playing / training with him often.*\\n\\n**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**\\n\\n*Unfortunately, no, not anymore.*\\n\\n**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**\\n\\n*Yes, I have a son (2 yrs old) and we spend a lot of time around family members ranging from 3 yrs old to 13 yrs old. I worked with my pit, who would get over excited when she saw my son and I am aware of the rough play risk a dog can pose. I am willing and able to work around this.*\\n\\n**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**\\n\\n*Never renting again.*\\n\\n**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**\\n\\n*I live in PA, USA, North America, Earth. No breed restrictions.*\\n\\n**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**\\n\\n*Peak Summer: \\\\\\\\\\\\~85 F, Peak winter: \\\\\\\\\\\\~30 F*\\n\\nAdditional Information and Questions\\n\\n**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**\\n\\n*I have a 2yr old son, a half acre yard surrounded by 6ft fences. There are many parks around me that are dog friendly.*\\n\\n*I have experience dealing with trouble behaviors (ex. my Cane Corso had crazy resource guarding and food aggression when we first got him).*\\n\\n*I'm looking for a dog that can go on hikes with me, but also chill at family functions for extended periods of time. I also want to be able to train to very high levels of obedience.*\\n\\n**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**\\n\\n*I feel like the working line GSD would require far too much exercise than I could realistically provide, but I have no in-person experience with them.*\\n\\n*Based on my information provided, does any one with working line GSD experience think I could provide the stimulation that would let them live a happy and fulfilled life?*\\n\\n*Is there a breed out there (that isn't a poodle) that actually fits all of the things I'm looking for?*\\n\\nThank you for reading all of this, looking forward to hearing your recommendations!\\n\\nEdit: I removed any misused terms to avoid further issues.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 2, 'content': 'Manic licking of former bandaged paw and aggressive behavior\\nI am coming to you out of desperation with our beloved dog amy. I am trying to compress a long story as much as possible:\\n\\nWe have a female mixed breed rescue dog, weighing just about 10kg (22lbs). She is neutered and has been living with us for 4.5 years now. Up until now we had no behavioral issues and she integrated very well in our daily lives. The household consists of two adults, no kids, no other pets. No Medication or known issues.\\n\\nUnfortunately on 2nd January 2025 she had an accident were a heavy object fell on her paw and injured it. She suffered a small fracture on a toe and has an open wound between two toes. We immediately went to a veterinary clinic. There she was x-rayed and examined. The fracture was seen as a minor issue that should heal on its own (this was later confirmed by an orthopedic surgeon), the cut was the more severe problem. The wound was cleaned and the foot was bandaged, no stitches were applied. The bandages were changed daily. She used the foot normally after that, no change in behavior was seen by us, we did only very short walks (about 3x 10 minutes/day).\\n\\nA week later the wound was examined again under sedation since she showed new signs of pain and was then stitched up. Pain medication was increased.\\n\\nThe (multiple) vets we saw say that the foot slowly needs to come out of the bandage for the wound to heal properly. Unfortunately amy starts to manically lick the paw as soon as she has any access to it. Muzzles or cones did not help (she is trained on both) and she reacts with unseen aggression to any attempt to stop her from licking. She growls loudly and snaps at my hands if i come close to the paw when she is licking it. Only getting her bandaged again at the vet stopped that behaviour.\\n\\nWe are now desperately looking for any insights or experience on how to keep a dog from licking the paw after it, this is our guess, now seems like a foreign object since it changed in smell and feel under the bandage. Especially when cones or muzzles are no option because she fights them violently.\\n\\nAll of this happened under close supervision of multiple vets, we are very certain that there are no other issues with the paw other then the aforementioned.\\n\\nThanks for any insights or ideas.

I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 0, 'content': \"My Girl (5Y) Died of Cancer 8 Months Ago—Need Help Finding a Breed that Suits Me and Info on How to Avoid Significant Health Issues.  \\nHello Everyone! I'm sorry for being another annoying breed recommendation post, but I'd really love the help of more knowledgeable people in looking on what breed fits my lifestyle and some recommendations for further research.\\n\\n  \\n**Introduction**\\n\\n1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\\n   * No. I've had dogs all my life. My girl, Bean, was the first puppy I've ever owned and trained (very successfully; she was often mistaken for a service dog due to how well she followed commands and her attention to her handler, me). However, I have lived with dogs my entire life. \\n2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a\\xa0[reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?\\n   * I've never purchased a dog and would like to rescue, but I am afraid of potential health issues  like Bean's, which is forcing me to consider purchasing a puppy from a reputable breeder with proven healthy lineages. \\n3. Describe your ideal dog.\\n   * I'd love a cuddly dog, handler-focused, clingy, and energetic but not so much as a working breed. I also LOVE dogs with goofy personalities, but that's more specific to the dog and less to a breed, I assume. \\n4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\\n   * Aesthetically, I love Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Anatolian Shepards, Rottweilers, and American Alsatians (which I recently heard are BYB dogs, which really put a damper on things, since they sounded pretty perfect to me). I just LOVE a huge dog with a big ole head and floppy ears. I also love Pitties/Bullies, but I can't really narrow it down to one specific breed, since I've only ever had pittie mix rescues. I just don't know enough about breed standards to provide a standard I'm interested in. I don't typically like curly haired breeds.\\n5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\\n   * Basic obedience and possibly dog sports, if the breed has more intense enrichment needs. This would be a companion dog, not a working dog.\\n6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\\n   * No desire/need to compete or have the dog work, but I'm willing to do anything to meet my dog's needs.\\n\\n**Care Commitments**\\n\\n7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\\n\\n   * At least an hour to two hours a day, but I was planning on leaving them at training/ doggy daycare while I work so that they get appropriate enrichment time. I enjoy training, playing, and walking with my dog and would love a dog that can both do that and also is happy to lay in bed with me on a lazy sunday. \\n\\n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?\\n\\n   * I volunteer at my local shelter and have done animal handling training, which makes me believe that dog parks are unnecessarily dangerous to dogs and can put undue stress on them because of the mixed playstyles and constant rotation of new players. I will not be doing dog parks. I like nature walks, short hikes, taking my dog out on the town (to dog-friendly areas), and I have a large backyard. I'd also walk them at least once a day on top of our outdoor time. \\n\\n9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\\n\\n   * I can groom regularly at home but am much more likely to pay a professional. My Bean was a short-haired bully mix and got groomed every 2-3 weeks. I love long-haired dogs but am afraid they'll overheat (Florida). \\n\\n**Personal Preferences**\\n\\n10) What size dog are you looking for?\\n\\n   * L-XL breeds. The bigger the better so long as their average lifespan is above 10. \\n\\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\\n\\n   * All of it. No such thing as too much from my baby. I deep clean regularly.\\n\\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\\n\\n   * Not at all. I have a fenced backyard and never let my dog off-leash in public due to danger from people or other dogs' behavior. \\n\\n**Dog Personality and Behavior**\\n\\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\\n\\n   * Snugglebug. \\n\\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?\\n\\n   * Either is fine. \\n\\n15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?\\n\\n   * Friendly is preferred, but Aloof is fine. I would not like a dog breed prone to reactivity. Of course, I will be training and de-sensitizing, but there are some more prone to reactivity than others, as you know.\\n\\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\\n\\n   * No. I would prefer that they are either ambivalent or dog-friendly, as I work with many dogs and would like to continue fostering.\\n\\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?\\n\\n   * High prey drive cannot be a factor, I have two cats and foster. I would prefer if they were friendly to small animals or felt the need to protect them, as my deceased baby did. \\n\\n**Lifestyle**\\n\\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\\n\\n   * Almost never. There is almost always someone home, but I will be the sole caretaker. \\n\\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?\\n\\n   * I will be the sole caretaker. The others can let them out to use the bathroom in the backyard, but I will be taking full care of the dog. They have no specific preferences outside of wanting a dog that will not harm other dogs or cats.\\n\\n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?\\n\\n   * Two cats. My mom, whom I live with, has a small lhasapoo that she rescued.\\n\\n21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\\n\\n   * No.\\n\\n22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\\n\\n   * No. I own.\\n\\n23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\\n\\n   * No breed restrictions. \\n\\n24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\\n\\n   * An average summer day is about 95 F with a Feels Like temp that CAN hit 106 due to high humidity. Typical winter day is around 70 F, but sometimes dips below 50 F (not frequently, maybe 30 days total in a year and always scattered between several winter months). \\n\\n**Additional Information and Questions**\\n\\n25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.\\n\\n   * My Bean died of osteosarcoma and I am petrified of another serious illness like osteosarcoma or hemangiosarcoma. I know must dog breeds suffer from cancer, but I would appreciate any feedback on how to lessen their odds of having to go through that. \\n\\n26) Feel free to ask any questions below.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's it!!

Now, this is 1-1.25 years from when she really started showing clearer dementia symptoms (starting to whimper for no reason, starting to pace a bit aimlessly, neurological weakness in her hind legs, being unsettled more). However, even before that, the subtle symptoms  began around 2 years ago (age 13-14 or so). Those symptoms are like your Pom\\'s current symptoms. My sweet girl, who used to let us carry her around like a baby in our arms, and who used to be excited to meet every single stranger she came across (when younger she worked as a therapy dog visiting patients in long term elderly care) , started showing aggression to my spouse and I. She would growl when we approached her face for snuggles, occasionally bite us, starting forgetting her tricks (she used to know a ton), stopped wanting to be handled as much yet was still clingy, starting walking past our house and not recognizing it, spent more time by herself etc. It was a change in character that we initially chalked up to old age or slight body pains. At that time, we got her x-rayed, full body examined, blood panel, etc and she had a clean bill of health so we knew her change in demeanor was not due to pain at that moment. But 2 years later, now today, our girl is very deep and clearly into the late stages of dementia. She now walks in circles, gets stuck behind furniture, can no longer solve food puzzles shes had her whole life and used to previously crush with ease, doesnt seek our attention, and seemingly has lost her volition/intent in her actions...shes almost like a passenger in her own body and no longer in control...I\\'ve been accepting that her time with us is coming to end. \\n\\nI wish I had recognized her symptoms earlier, when they first began. It was only about 1 year ago when my vet and I started coming up with a gameplan in terms of supplements/treatment/medication to help slow the dementia down. CCD will 100 percent progress in its severity, but the rate of which may be slowed if you take action. Even so, while we had managed her dementia well for the last 6 months, it still took a sudden turn for the worse this last week, even though we have continued the same program. Its the unfortunate nature of this terrible disease. \\n\\nMy advice for u is to ensure that you are treating all the possible causations that are possibly due to pain (make sure her dental is good, and that she has treatment for arthritis if she has that, have her ears examined for infections etc), and if that doesn\\'t change your dogs demeanor, you should start thinking about dementia as the causation. If your vet is not familiar with CCD, and many are not, change vets. Many vets just think its anxiety, and prescribe meds for those symptoms. I had to find a vet that understood CCD and that would prescribe me Anipryl/Selegeline, which is the only FDA approved drug to treat CCD in dogs. Our girl is also on senilife supplement.  That being said, the most helpful for us has been the introduction of Gabapentin, which both calms her anxiety and helps with pain  If you want a great resource on this topic, considering reading Eileen Anderson\\'s book \"Remember Me.\"  It consolidates a lot of info about dementia in dogs. My vet also provided me with great summary about other potential  drugs/supps that we should try throughout this journey. DM me and I\\'ll forward to you. \\n\\nThe tough part about dogs at this age is that there are often comorbidities. Their vision can be getting worse, there hearing is diminishing, and in turn that also affects their ability to interact with the environment and keep their brain stimulated and strong. My girl got worse as she became more deaf, and more recently her vision has gotten worse which also seems to have made her symptoms worse. She started having more accidents in the house, not only because of her dementia, but also because she started showing signs of kidney disease at age 15.  If you can, try to keep your dog engaged with exercise, training, or some other mental stimulation, to the extent that she is comfortable doing so...studies show that dogs on dementia meds do even better when they have exercise/stimulation. Lastly, please baby proof their environment. Consider putting down yoga mats for traction throughout the house.  As dogs progress in dementia, they started doing wild Sh\\\\*t they never would have done before. My girl who used to train agility, would now face plant jumping off sidewalk curbs because she couldn\\'t judge distance anymore. She also zoomied straight into a wall the other day.  My first dog that had dementia who passed 4 years ago, jumped through the rungs of our 2nd story railing, he survived but it clearly was not good for him.  Lastly, be patient with your pup and yourself and dont be too hard on yourself. Realize that none of the things your dog is doing, is out of spite or within their control, and realize that there will be bumps along the way and that you are doing the best you can to control the things within your reach.

After a few weeks of this, he started to become reactive when I got close to him so I stopped the medication. Luckily, it’s summer and he no longer has dry eyes. \\n\\nIn the past few months, he’s become more and more aggressive towards me, my boyfriend and everyone that he knows. It’s to the point where I can’t even put his leash on without him biting my hands. I’m not sure if it’s to do with being upset about the past treatment plan, but I’m also starting to wonder if it’s dementia/cognitive decline. \\n\\nHe seems upset and confused most of the day and was the most cuddly dog in the past. \\n\\nHe still eats normally, uses the washroom outside, does tricks (on some days) and knows his way to the park. He’s friendly with other dogs on the street but barely walks- he’s incredibly slow and has trouble turning corners. I can see his legs shaking but if I pick him up, he’ll bark loudly in my arms and try his best to bite me. \\n\\nAt night, he lays in bed and barks as if someone is there when I’m in the other room.

She’s healthy, her bloodwork is perfect, and she has no preexisting conditions. The vet told me she would have all of her teeth pulled eventually because of an “overactive immune system” with no additional explanation. This is my first cat, and I need to know what the next steps are.\\n\\nMy cat is almost three years old, a domestic shorthair, and has never had any chronic health issues. She stays inside full time, is up to date on all vaccines, has annual exams and preventative blood work, is negative for FEL-V/DIV/heartworms, eats grain-free food (PURINA ONE Indoor Advantage), we use Revolution for heartworm/flea/tick, and she eats a few Greenies most days. The only health issue she’s had was an injection site reaction, which resolved without any surgical intervention.\\n\\nI wanted to get her teeth cleaned last year, and the vet told me it would be overkill because she didn’t have any plaque or tartar, and her bloodwork was perfect. I took her in for her annual exam a few weeks ago and told the vet that her breath was starting to smell and that I’d like to have her teeth cleaned before it became an issue. When we went over the estimate, there was a section noting extractions, and the vet told me the odds of her needing anything extracted were extremely low because she was showing no signs of issues with her teeth or gums.\\n\\nI scheduled the appointment and took her in on Thursday. I got a call from the surgeon a few hours later, and they told me she needed to extract 6 teeth, and I needed to decide immediately because she was under anesthesia. I asked if there were any other options (my mind was blown by the idea of her having that many teeth removed and not having time to think it through), and she said, “Steroids, but you can’t do it long term. It’s a bacterial infection.” When I asked what would cause this, she told me that while my cat had very little plaque or tartar, her gums were inflamed (the opposite of what I’d been told a few weeks ago), and she would eventually need to have all of her teeth pulled.\\xa0\\n\\nI decided to let them pull the six teeth because I felt like I was under the gun, and I didn’t want her to be in pain or sick. When I went to pick her up, I asked to speak with someone about what was going on with her teeth that would have caused this, and the surgeon came out and was … caustic. They refused to tell me anything beyond that my cat will eventually be toothless, and I’ll need to get her teeth cleaned twice a year or more, and I should expect to pay for extractions every time.\\xa0\\n\\nI asked what was going on with a bacterial infection and if she needed antibiotics. She said no. She also told me that wet food was optional (she usually eats kibble), which felt odd to me when she’d had 6 teeth pulled, but I don’t know anything about feline dental care, so I accepted it. FWIW, I did put her on wet food.\\n\\nI took her home, and we’ve been on a strict schedule with Onsior (3 days), gabapentin (2x/day), and now Enulose (2x/day). She’s been able to use her litter box and is starting to behave like her normal self again (making biscuits, jumping on furniture, etc). She is eating (I don't know how to compare the wet food consumption to her usual kibble, but she seems ok) and just started drinking water again last night.\\n\\nI understand that I’m probably coming off like an insane pet owner right now. I’m in STEM, so everything is quantifiable to me (lol). I played the recording of the surgeon to my friend, who’s worked in vet clinics for decades, and she told me the entire interaction felt off and I should get a second opinion ASAP. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but the clinic she went to is one of many under the same umbrella company (VetSavers). I spoke with a friend about it, and she told me her cat has this issue, and it’s called stomatitis.\\xa0\\n\\nMy real question is what my next steps should be. I scheduled an appointment with a different vet for a second opinion, signed up for pet insurance (Embrace), and looked into stomatitis. I have no idea what I’m doing here, and the amount of information out there about “this cured my cat” is too vast for me to sift through. I’m not a “let’s start this supplement!” without consulting with a vet, and I’m skeptical about anything that hasn’t been proven scientifically.\\xa0Notably, I'm a grad student, and my budget is limited, but if I have enough time to plan for it, I can make it work.\\n\\nAny advice or ideas would be appreciated.

This is my first dog and I am not fully versed in breeding and how genetics in dogs actually really work. \\n\\nBefore I got him I did my research, talked to the breeder numerous times and met his mother and the other dogs in her home. Everything seemed really great. The parents are both health tested and have great scores, have great titles from championship as they are working line labradors. His dad was flown in from Ireland to breed. Online I could find a generational heritage line going back 5 generations. No information about health testing for the older ones but I could probably find out if I really wanted to. The only “issue” I could find was that the dad  has a 3/7 hip dysphasia score. I don’t even really know what that means. I met the puppies 3 times and everything seemed great as a first time dog owner.  My puppy was the most aloof and very independent at 9 weeks old. The breeder picked him for me saying “you’re young, you can handle a challenge” i still wonder if I should have just said no to that. \\n\\nMy dog has so many issues. I love him more than anything and we have worked hard on his issues. Now we are finally after 3 years getting to a good place with his training and his temperament. He has chronic gastritis which my vet believes resulted in high anxiety as we couldn’t figure out at first why he has so many stomach issues. He’s now on a hyperallergenic diet and doing well but during the crucial months when he was younger I didn’t know what was wrong with him even after many vet appointments. This led to him being very reactive to strangers interacting with him. Which shouldn’t be the case in a well bred Labrador. He would lunge and growl at strangers who looked at him a bit too long or tried to speak to me (not even him). This period of time was hard and isolating for me. I spent thousands on trainers and dog schools but it didn’t change much. This started at 12 weeks old and got worse as he got older. After no progress with trainers. I started to simply challenge him with new situation and heavily rewarding good behavior. Slowly he got more confident and I can now take him with me to restaurants and meet new people with almost no issues. But it took a long time and was emotionally really hard for me as he is also a big dog and I’m a small ish woman; so his reactions were scary for everyone involved. I still have a lot of management i need to do in certain situation for him to succeed. \\n\\nAround 1 1/2 - 2 years old his behavior  outside got worse. Constant pulling, obsessive sniffing to the point where he would take me down If I tried to walk him away from a spot he wanted to sniff badly. I have been injured by him pulling me down the stairs or just the constant pulling hurting my Shoulders, knees etc. \\nTook him to many trainers, they all said it was teenage behavior which I knew wasnt true. Only 1 trainer said that he has never seen behavior like his in a lab and doesn’t really know how to fix it. He’s a smart dog and likes to learn but after more than 10.000€ spent dog trainers and vet appointments he still can’t walk on a loose leash?? I knew something was wrong with him. \\n\\nAfter being dismissed by so many trainers and vets about his “teenage boy behavior” I just decided to neuter him and hope for a change. So I found a better vet who listened and found out he is hypersexual and had a massively large prostate. Now he’s been neutered and he’s so much more calm, less nervous and less reactive. Great recall, great off leash. It’s like all our hard work finally clicked in his brain. \\nI also found out he has mild hip dysplasia. Nothing serious for now but not great for when he gets older. \\n\\nI love my dog. He is my whole world. But he’s a mess. Most people would have given up on him and after a particularly bad day I thought about it too. This working dog could never  be used for hunting, I could barely walk him for a long time. So my question is: considering all of his issues, how can he be from a good breeder? Am I morally obligated to tell my breeder Incase she breeds his parents again? \\nDid I just get unlucky or does it have to be genetic? He’s deeply loved and exceptionally well taken care off and never encountered anything actually scary that could explain his behavior. \\n\\nSorry for the super long text but this has been bugging me for a while now. Any answers are very appreciated.

The vet has been hesitant to do so the last year or so because of his age. We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. \\n\\nBecause of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath. We tried all sorts of vet recommended supplements/meds to help with the pacing to no avail and now are moving onto an $85 bag of prescription hard dog food said to help with CCD, which I’ll need to soften and likely blend because of his teeth. They don’t make it in a soft food. \\n\\nHe tries to bite me anytime I pick him up to go up/down stairs. So at least twice a day he’s super mad at me. Yet all I want to do it pet his ears and snuggle. It’s been exhausting the last few months. Saying all this makes it sound like he’s miserable. I’m sure sometimes he is but most of the time he still seems to be a happy dog. He does adorable laps around the house when I get home. Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack. One of my favorite things is when he’s eating and his tail does a couple little wags…reminds me of a little kid dancing cause their food is good. \\n\\nI feel really torn on taking on the expense and risk of the dental, assuming he’s clearly for it by the cardiologist. Putting his little body through anesthesia seems like a lot. And as shitty as it feels to say, spending nearly $2000 for a dog at the top of his age expectancy is a lot. The vet and I spent a long time talking recently. The conclusion is there’s no right or wrong answer on how I should proceed, either try to keep him comfortable until it’s time (cause I don’t think we’re at that point yet) or try to be aggressive with treatment. \\n\\nHe’s my little buddy and I hate the feeling that I’m going to pick poorly, that his time is running out, and that he might be in pain.

I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 8, 'content': 'My boy was diagnosed with degenerative arthritis vs degenerative myopathy in the ER today \\nMy boy Nokie Bear collapsed after our 1 mile walk at the lake this morning. \\n\\nHe refused to go up the dog ramp into the car.

The vet has been hesitant to do so the last year or so because of his age. We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. \\n\\nBecause of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath. We tried all sorts of vet recommended supplements/meds to help with the pacing to no avail and now are moving onto an $85 bag of prescription hard dog food said to help with CCD, which I’ll need to soften and likely blend because of his teeth. They don’t make it in a soft food. \\n\\nHe tries to bite me anytime I pick him up to go up/down stairs. So at least twice a day he’s super mad at me. Yet all I want to do it pet his ears and snuggle. It’s been exhausting the last few months. Saying all this makes it sound like he’s miserable. I’m sure sometimes he is but most of the time he still seems to be a happy dog. He does adorable laps around the house when I get home. Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack. One of my favorite things is when he’s eating and his tail does a couple little wags…reminds me of a little kid dancing cause their food is good. \\n\\nI feel really torn on taking on the expense and risk of the dental, assuming he’s clearly for it by the cardiologist. Putting his little body through anesthesia seems like a lot. And as shitty as it feels to say, spending nearly $2000 for a dog at the top of his age expectancy is a lot. The vet and I spent a long time talking recently.

I took him to the vet and after a few tests, my boy is suspected to have FIP, renal cancer, or a gnarly kidney infection, but shes leaning more towards renal cancer. I was told that if it's not a kidney infection, the other 2 illnesses that she suspects him to have do not have positive outcomes and very costly and that I should euthanize him. At that moment, I decided to treat it as if he has the infection. \\n\\nShe called me the next day to ask how he was doing on his antis and to tell me thats the results of his urine test was negative for infection and that his kidney functions are normal. Im not a doctor, but hearing that his kidneys were normal made me think he either doesnt have cancer or that its early enough to help him through it. So inquired about treating him for FIP until I save for an ultrasound to see if he had cancer (which my job would provide treatment for). She said no, and that treatment will only buy him a few months at best and brought up euthanasia again. So I went on FIP Warriors on FB and got a vial of GS. According to many of them, their cats are still alive many years after the 12 wks of treatment. The day after his first dose it was almost night and day. It could be his antis or it could be the GS treatment, idk, but he's doing better. Still sluggish, but eating a little more, and not sleeping all day nonetheless\\n\\nI planned to continue buying the FIP treatments online, but at the same time I was hoping she'd prescribe it so his insurance would cover it.  She's been my vet for many years and even the vet for my childhood pets when my mom was alive. She's the kindest most sympathic human being on the planet.

Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 8, 'content': 'My boy was diagnosed with degenerative arthritis vs degenerative myopathy in the ER today \\nMy boy Nokie Bear collapsed after our 1 mile walk at the lake this morning. \\n\\nHe refused to go up the dog ramp into the car.

Does act like he hears something outside before he starts digging? Where does he go/do when he gets loose? \\n\\nI don't recommend crating an anxious dog in the sense of locking him in a crate. But crate training, which teaches them to enjoy the relaxing in their crate could help him settle. My dog goes to his crate whenever he feels anxious and I just keep the crate door unlocked all the time. It never locks.

The vet has been hesitant to do so the last year or so because of his age. We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. \\n\\nBecause of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath. We tried all sorts of vet recommended supplements/meds to help with the pacing to no avail and now are moving onto an $85 bag of prescription hard dog food said to help with CCD, which I’ll need to soften and likely blend because of his teeth. They don’t make it in a soft food. \\n\\nHe tries to bite me anytime I pick him up to go up/down stairs. So at least twice a day he’s super mad at me. Yet all I want to do it pet his ears and snuggle. It’s been exhausting the last few months. Saying all this makes it sound like he’s miserable. I’m sure sometimes he is but most of the time he still seems to be a happy dog. He does adorable laps around the house when I get home. Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack. One of my favorite things is when he’s eating and his tail does a couple little wags…reminds me of a little kid dancing cause their food is good. \\n\\nI feel really torn on taking on the expense and risk of the dental, assuming he’s clearly for it by the cardiologist. Putting his little body through anesthesia seems like a lot. And as shitty as it feels to say, spending nearly $2000 for a dog at the top of his age expectancy is a lot. The vet and I spent a long time talking recently. The conclusion is there’s no right or wrong answer on how I should proceed, either try to keep him comfortable until it’s time (cause I don’t think we’re at that point yet) or try to be aggressive with treatment. \\n\\nHe’s my little buddy and I hate the feeling that I’m going to pick poorly, that his time is running out, and that he might be in pain.

I took him to the vet and after a few tests, my boy is suspected to have FIP, renal cancer, or a gnarly kidney infection, but shes leaning more towards renal cancer. I was told that if it's not a kidney infection, the other 2 illnesses that she suspects him to have do not have positive outcomes and very costly and that I should euthanize him. At that moment, I decided to treat it as if he has the infection. \\n\\nShe called me the next day to ask how he was doing on his antis and to tell me thats the results of his urine test was negative for infection and that his kidney functions are normal. Im not a doctor, but hearing that his kidneys were normal made me think he either doesnt have cancer or that its early enough to help him through it. So inquired about treating him for FIP until I save for an ultrasound to see if he had cancer (which my job would provide treatment for). She said no, and that treatment will only buy him a few months at best and brought up euthanasia again. So I went on FIP Warriors on FB and got a vial of GS. According to many of them, their cats are still alive many years after the 12 wks of treatment. The day after his first dose it was almost night and day. It could be his antis or it could be the GS treatment, idk, but he's doing better. Still sluggish, but eating a little more, and not sleeping all day nonetheless\\n\\nI planned to continue buying the FIP treatments online, but at the same time I was hoping she'd prescribe it so his insurance would cover it.  She's been my vet for many years and even the vet for my childhood pets when my mom was alive. She's the kindest most sympathic human being on the planet. I want her to be apart of his path to a healthy life again, but I'm nervous that she'd be against my choice and not help \\n\\nAm I completely overthinking because I'm stressed af rn?

Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 7, 'content': \"My cat passed this in her urine—looking for advice, please.\\nHi everyone,\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, I took my 3-year-old female DSH cat to the vet because she was struggling to urinate and passing blood and mucus.\\n\\nThe vet ruled out a UTI after testing a large sample and suspected cystitis caused by stress (likely NYE fireworks).

At around 7:30 last night, we saw that our dog got into our bathroom trash and ate 3 or 4 used tampons. I immediately took him to the nearest emergency vet and they induced vomiting within the hour. He threw up a tiny amount of kibble-y vomit, nothing else. We were referred to another vet that was better equipped for next steps.\\n\\nMy dog is a 9 year old Cavalier with MVD and a grade 5 heart murmur.

However, they said they worry about his ability to even survive full exploratory surgery, which absolutely crushed me.

I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 7, 'content': \"My cat passed this in her urine—looking for advice, please.\\nHi everyone,\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, I took my 3-year-old female DSH cat to the vet because she was struggling to urinate and passing blood and mucus.\\n\\nThe vet ruled out a UTI after testing a large sample and suspected cystitis caused by stress (likely NYE fireworks).

The vet prescribed trazadone to help her feel more calm and relaxed during anxious times, especially during the evenings. Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics. I am having difficulty differentiating between panting due to anxiety and panting due to breathing issues.\\n\\nThanks so much if you made it this far, and TIA for advice/recommendations!!', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13hp4gc/dog_with_dementiaanxiety/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'My 16 year old chi-mix also has dementia and I\\'ve been watching its progression for about 1-1.25 years now. Now, this is 1-1.25 years from when she really started showing clearer dementia symptoms (starting to whimper for no reason, starting to pace a bit aimlessly, neurological weakness in her hind legs, being unsettled more). However, even before that, the subtle symptoms  began around 2 years ago (age 13-14 or so). Those symptoms are like your Pom\\'s current symptoms. My sweet girl, who used to let us carry her around like a baby in our arms, and who used to be excited to meet every single stranger she came across (when younger she worked as a therapy dog visiting patients in long term elderly care) , started showing aggression to my spouse and I. She would growl when we approached her face for snuggles, occasionally bite us, starting forgetting her tricks (she used to know a ton), stopped wanting to be handled as much yet was still clingy, starting walking past our house and not recognizing it, spent more time by herself etc. It was a change in character that we initially chalked up to old age or slight body pains. At that time, we got her x-rayed, full body examined, blood panel, etc and she had a clean bill of health so we knew her change in demeanor was not due to pain at that moment. But 2 years later, now today, our girl is very deep and clearly into the late stages of dementia. She now walks in circles, gets stuck behind furniture, can no longer solve food puzzles shes had her whole life and used to previously crush with ease, doesnt seek our attention, and seemingly has lost her volition/intent in her actions...shes almost like a passenger in her own body and no longer in control...I\\'ve been accepting that her time with us is coming to end. \\n\\nI wish I had recognized her symptoms earlier, when they first began. It was only about 1 year ago when my vet and I started coming up with a gameplan in terms of supplements/treatment/medication to help slow the dementia down. CCD will 100 percent progress in its severity, but the rate of which may be slowed if you take action. Even so, while we had managed her dementia well for the last 6 months, it still took a sudden turn for the worse this last week, even though we have continued the same program. Its the unfortunate nature of this terrible disease. \\n\\nMy advice for u is to ensure that you are treating all the possible causations that are possibly due to pain (make sure her dental is good, and that she has treatment for arthritis if she has that, have her ears examined for infections etc), and if that doesn\\'t change your dogs demeanor, you should start thinking about dementia as the causation. If your vet is not familiar with CCD, and many are not, change vets. Many vets just think its anxiety, and prescribe meds for those symptoms. I had to find a vet that understood CCD and that would prescribe me Anipryl/Selegeline, which is the only FDA approved drug to treat CCD in dogs. Our girl is also on senilife supplement.  That being said, the most helpful for us has been the introduction of Gabapentin, which both calms her anxiety and helps with pain  If you want a great resource on this topic, considering reading Eileen Anderson\\'s book \"Remember Me.\"  It consolidates a lot of info about dementia in dogs. My vet also provided me with great summary about other potential  drugs/supps that we should try throughout this journey. DM me and I\\'ll forward to you. \\n\\nThe tough part about dogs at this age is that there are often comorbidities. Their vision can be getting worse, there hearing is diminishing, and in turn that also affects their ability to interact with the environment and keep their brain stimulated and strong. My girl got worse as she became more deaf, and more recently her vision has gotten worse which also seems to have made her symptoms worse. She started having more accidents in the house, not only because of her dementia, but also because she started showing signs of kidney disease at age 15.  If you can, try to keep your dog engaged with exercise, training, or some other mental stimulation, to the extent that she is comfortable doing so...studies show that dogs on dementia meds do even better when they have exercise/stimulation. Lastly, please baby proof their environment. Consider putting down yoga mats for traction throughout the house.  As dogs progress in dementia, they started doing wild Sh\\\\*t they never would have done before. My girl who used to train agility, would now face plant jumping off sidewalk curbs because she couldn\\'t judge distance anymore. She also zoomied straight into a wall the other day.  My first dog that had dementia who passed 4 years ago, jumped through the rungs of our 2nd story railing, he survived but it clearly was not good for him.  Lastly, be patient with your pup and yourself and dont be too hard on yourself. Realize that none of the things your dog is doing, is out of spite or within their control, and realize that there will be bumps along the way and that you are doing the best you can to control the things within your reach.

After a few weeks of this, he started to become reactive when I got close to him so I stopped the medication. Luckily, it’s summer and he no longer has dry eyes. \\n\\nIn the past few months, he’s become more and more aggressive towards me, my boyfriend and everyone that he knows. It’s to the point where I can’t even put his leash on without him biting my hands. I’m not sure if it’s to do with being upset about the past treatment plan, but I’m also starting to wonder if it’s dementia/cognitive decline. \\n\\nHe seems upset and confused most of the day and was the most cuddly dog in the past. \\n\\nHe still eats normally, uses the washroom outside, does tricks (on some days) and knows his way to the park. He’s friendly with other dogs on the street but barely walks- he’s incredibly slow and has trouble turning corners. I can see his legs shaking but if I pick him up, he’ll bark loudly in my arms and try his best to bite me. \\n\\nAt night, he lays in bed and barks as if someone is there when I’m in the other room. I try to calm him down but he threatens to attack me so I just try to leave him alone. He also stopped letting my boyfriend get near him even though he’s been in his life since he was a puppy. \\n\\nI took him to the vet, he thinks the sudden aggression is to do with pain, arthritis and cognitive decline. He mentioned the main signs of dementia are things like house soiling, pacing, forgetting where his dish his but he doesn’t do any of those things. \\nInstead, he just has a total change of character- more aggressive, reactive, doesn’t want to be touched/looked at. \\n\\nAll of my friends think it’s time to euthanize him because he’s a completely different dog than he was a year ago, but I’m honestly not sure if this is a case of negative conditioning from his past treatment or if he is seriously confused/in pain. \\n\\nIf you could please let me know your thoughts/experiences with senior dogs with CCD I would greatly appreciate it. \\n\\nI don’t want to euthanize a healthy dog that is just upset, but I also don’t want to make him live in pain if that’s the case. \", 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': 'Curious: Do you use aromatherapy on your dog?\\nMy dog\\'s become more territorial and reactive/lunge-y at strangers and dogs over the past week, so we\\'re going back to basics.

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to\\nproduce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.\\n\\nAnxitane\\n-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.\\n-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.\\n\\nValerian Root:\\n-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.\\n-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals.

If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**\\n\\n*No, I have owned a Cane Corso, American Pitbull Terrier and a GSD Mix. All of my dogs were trained in basic obedience (Sit, Stay, Down, Recall, loose lead walking)*\\n\\n**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**\\n\\n*I just lost my Cane Corse to Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and my APBT to bone cancer within a year of each other. They were 10 and 9, respectively. So, I'll be going the reputable breeder route to minimize any health issues moving forward.*\\n\\n**Describe your ideal dog.**\\n\\n*My dream dog is medium - X- Large, minimal-moderate shedding, easily trainable, happy on a hike or in the house for a movie night. They will accompany me almost everywhere, other than work.*\\n\\n**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**\\n\\n*My dream breed is a Dutch Shepherd, they are the most beautiful breed I've ever seen. Unfortunately, my research has built up some fear of not being able to sufficiently meet the breeds physical exercise requirements, (From my understanding, they are like Malinois level energizer bunnies that just go and go) and I've also read that they do not enjoy cuddling after a days work, which is something I absolutely need in a breed lol.*\\n\\n*This has led me to lean towards the GSD breed. I do not particularly like the look of the showline GSD, but their temperament and exercise requirements seem to be exactly what I need. I LOVE the look of the dark sable working line shepherds, with the more square structure and healthier hips / elbows, but I have the same hesitations that come with the Dutch Shepherds regarding the 23.5hrs a day of exercise required to make them happy lol.*\\n\\n*I also feel like the Doberman could be ideal for me, but their breed-specific health issues seem way too common. Kind of scares me, do NOT want another dog to get sick on me.*\\n\\n**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**\\n\\n*Advanced Obedience (Strict heel, down, stay, sit, place, recall, off-lead obedience for hikes), I will be putting a TON of time and energy into the socialization of my pup so he can go to lots of places with me and be comfortable and happy, and, potentially some bite and scent work training that could translate into IPO-style dog sports for fun.*\\n\\n**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**\\n\\n*This is a possibilty down the road when I think he's bored with our normal training routines. I have 0 experience in this field, however.*\\n\\nCare Commitments\\n\\n**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**\\n\\n*I will be doing about 30-60 mins of obedience training, 60-90mins of physcial play, 2-3 walks about 2 miles each, and as much socialization I can each day. At home, my family will be interacting with him nonstop (light play indoors, cuddling, etc.)*\\n\\n**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**\\n\\n*an hour - hour and a half of physical exercise is a realistic number I can hit daily (more on weekends as I go for hikes or walk through state parks on saturday mornings), I also calculate mental and physical exercise as separate activities, so we will also be doing another 30/60 mins of mental exercise via obedience training and puzzles. This includes walks around the neghborhood, playing in our fenced backyard, going to any of the local parks, hiking, etc.*\\n\\n*I will NOT be using a dog park. I have seen way too many untrained dogs at dog parks that just become a danger to have around my pups. my pit was attacked at a dog park, it took me years to make her comfortable around strange dogs again. We will walk through dog parks, but we will not be going into the kennel areas and going off leash for unstructured play with strange dogs.*\\n\\n**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**\\n\\n*I'd prefer a brushing once or twice a week, cleaning ears is fine with me, but I do not want to have to pay a groomer for constant haircuts.*\\n\\nPersonal Preferences\\n\\n**10) What size dog are you looking for?**\\n\\n*Medium to large but Extra Large is also fine with me.*\\n\\n**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**\\n\\n*My Cane Corso slobbered me out, I am now looking for as little drool as I can get while maintaining some of the traits I need. He will be my going everywhere he’s allowed to with me, so slobbering can make people uncomfortable in public or at BBQ's or something lol.*\\n\\n**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**\\n\\n*I would love to be able to keep my dog off-lead whenever it is safe to do so. I'd say very important.*\\n\\nDog Personality and Behavior\\n\\n**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**\\n\\n*I actually love both of these personalities. My APBT was a snuggle bug, while my Cane Corso would get up and go lay across the room after a few minutes of petting. If I had to choose, I'd say I prefer a snuggly dog.*\\n\\n**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**\\n\\n*Eagerness to please is a necessity for my plans with my pup.*\\n\\n**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**\\n\\n*I would prefer for the dog to have guarding instincts, for sure. I have a son who plays in my yard and If a stranger enters my yard, they should know IMMEDIATELY  that they are not welcome. (My Corso was EXCEPTIONAL at this, while my Pit just wanted to love on everyone she saw lol). Knocking on my door -- I'd prefer an alert bark. The dog will be put into a place while I answer the door.*\\n\\n**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**\\n\\n*I hope, with the amount of socialization I'd be working on through puppyhood, that this wouldn't be an issue but, if it was, I would absolutely put the work in to fix this behaviour.*\\n\\n**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**\\n\\n*The way people talk about Huskies just bolting over fences or out of doors because they want to roam seems like an absolute nightmare. Insanely high prey drive is also something I'd like to avoid, as I live in an area that has a LOT of rabbits and small dogs walking around with their owners.*\\n\\nLifestyle\\n\\n**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**\\n\\n*The dog will be alone for 4-6hrs, 2-3 times a week.*\\n\\n**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**\\n\\n*Minimal-Moderate shedding, she will be prepping the dogs meals sometimes and playing / training with him often.*\\n\\n**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**\\n\\n*Unfortunately, no, not anymore.*\\n\\n**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**\\n\\n*Yes, I have a son (2 yrs old) and we spend a lot of time around family members ranging from 3 yrs old to 13 yrs old. I worked with my pit, who would get over excited when she saw my son and I am aware of the rough play risk a dog can pose. I am willing and able to work around this.*\\n\\n**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**\\n\\n*Never renting again.*\\n\\n**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**\\n\\n*I live in PA, USA, North America, Earth. No breed restrictions.*\\n\\n**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**\\n\\n*Peak Summer: \\\\\\\\\\\\~85 F, Peak winter: \\\\\\\\\\\\~30 F*\\n\\nAdditional Information and Questions\\n\\n**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**\\n\\n*I have a 2yr old son, a half acre yard surrounded by 6ft fences. There are many parks around me that are dog friendly.*\\n\\n*I have experience dealing with trouble behaviors (ex. my Cane Corso had crazy resource guarding and food aggression when we first got him).*\\n\\n*I'm looking for a dog that can go on hikes with me, but also chill at family functions for extended periods of time. I also want to be able to train to very high levels of obedience.*\\n\\n**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**\\n\\n*I feel like the working line GSD would require far too much exercise than I could realistically provide, but I have no in-person experience with them.*\\n\\n*Based on my information provided, does any one with working line GSD experience think I could provide the stimulation that would let them live a happy and fulfilled life?*\\n\\n*Is there a breed out there (that isn't a poodle) that actually fits all of the things I'm looking for?*\\n\\nThank you for reading all of this, looking forward to hearing your recommendations!\\n\\nEdit: I removed any misused terms to avoid further issues.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 8, 'content': 'Cost concerns, two dogs needing procedures, not sure what to do, need advice please. \\nI’m in a bit of a predicament between my two dogs. Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

Here\\'s why I hate Chewy. [discussion]\\nNo, it\\'s not the revenue loss.  Pretty much every vet who\\'s not on the brink of retirement age has accepted the loss of the in-clinic pharmacy as an inevitability.  This post also isn\\'t about online pharmacies in general.  I don\\'t necessarily *like* Walmart, or 1-800-PETMEDS, or Allivet.  However, I *hate* Chewy.\\n\\nMy problem is the dishonesty.  You ever get one of those emails or calls where they say your vet hasn\\'t approved the prescription?  Our clients sure did too.  In fact, Chewy accidentally sent us an email recently that was meant for clients:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>Dear Pet Parent,  \\n>  \\n>Chewy is committed to your pet\\'s health and happiness. Challenging times like these will never change that.  \\n>  \\n>We are actively working to contact your veterinarian to get your pet’s prescription approved, so we can deliver your pet’s essential medicine as fast as possible. Unfortunately, we haven\\'t been able to get through as of yet.  \\n>  \\n>These are unprecedented times and it may be possible that your vet is extra busy or working reduced hours. If you’d like to help, you can also contact your veterinarian’s office to find out where they are with approvals.  \\n>  \\n>Your pet\\'s well-being will always be our top priority and we’re doing everything we can to make sure your order goes through.  \\n>  \\n>We appreciate your support. Stay well and find moments of comfort with your pet.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"We\\'re working oh so hard on getting the prescription to you, if only your vet would approve it!\"\\n\\nWhat we found from several of our clients: on numerous occasions (or perhaps all), they were sending this email out the *second* they actually sent the email requesting approval from your vet.  Our clinic always printed out and took care of all approvals by noon the day the prescription requests came in.   Yet, we had always dealt with clients angry about how we weren\\'t approving their scripts.  We would have to send approvals multiple times.  In fact we eventually had to disconnect our fax simply because sending Chewy scripts 3-4 times for each request clogged a free phone line and took up a lot of time.   Chewy tended to be the most egregious of the companies to do this.\\n\\nSo instead we stuck with emails which have convenient time stamps...and the ability to bcc them to the client :)\\n\\nSuddenly, when we started sending these emails to the client with a time stamp from both Chewy\\'s email and our approval, they were calling Chewy instead of us to complain, yelling at customer service when they tried to call the client and claim we weren\\'t approving it, or ditching Chewy altogether.  We got to see both sides ourselves too.  On one fun occasion, we didn\\'t have a medication that our tech needed for her dog but could only order a 1000 count bottle, so she ordered from Chewy.  They didn\\'t respond for about 5 days, then sent the first and only email approval to us at 5pm on a Saturday and then the email to our technician that they were unable to reach us after three attempts at about 7am the following morning.\\n\\nThen the demands came from Chewy for either verbal approval (no paper trail, and no accountability for them), or fax (a paper trail but difficult to send/prove to client, so in most cases, still no accountability for them).  On one occasion we denied both and told them via phone to email three times over the span of an hour, admittedly with some rudeness on the third, and they proceeded to try to send a fax through our phone line consecutively for 35 minutes straight.  I was doing an emergency surgery on a dog with a wound with a bad bleeder from the linguofacial vein while this was happening.  Needless to say, it was hard to concentrate on saving the patient but we couldn\\'t disconnect the phone line in case another urgent call needed to be answered.  The dog did fine (for anyone worrying about this) :).\\n\\nAll of the dishonesty with the timing of approvals have been worse recently.  I suspect related to difficulty with supply in the COVID-19 crisis.  It\\'s been tough for us too, and we\\'ve been honest with clients about this.  So with Chewy, I suspect that instead of saying \"we\\'re having shipping delays\" or \"we\\'re on backorder for that very common thing\", they\\'re simply claiming the vet isn\\'t responding while they deal with delayed arrivals/shipments.\\n\\nSo now they\\'ve stopped doing emails altogether.  They can do fax or verbal approval (again, no accountability), or a new option.  They have an online platform called Petscriptions (again from what their own customer service implied, communication on the timing of prescriptions had no accountability for them, they can say whatever they want).  Furthermore, with yours and our data becoming a more valuable resource, I don\\'t want to make the data mining that every online company does even easier for them.\\n\\nI\\'m not writing this for the revenue.  You\\'ve all heard the \"shop local\" argument so many times I\\'d be beating a dead horse by saying it.  Money is tight, especially now.  And if you wanted to order online to save some money, I encourage you to do so.  I\\'m writing this because Chewy has peddled the idea that they genuinely *care* about your pets, through those occasional oil paintings from someone you and your dog have never met, to the kindhearted condolence texts that, when you read them with an objective eye, seem suspiciously formulaic, to the \"customer is always right\" level of pandering that you and I both know is harmful.  However, the stuff I described above is how they behave when dealing with a vital step in getting your pet the medication they need.  Given that this is one of those steps that you can\\'t see, I think it\\'s telling of how much they *actually* care about your pet.\\n\\nIt shouldn\\'t need to be said that a corporation doesn\\'t care about you or your fur-buddy, but here it is.  I only say this because there *are* people who care about your pet: you, your family, your neighbors (well, sometimes).   And yes, also your doggy daycare workers, your groomers, every worker at your vets office.  If we didn\\'t care about your pet, we wouldn\\'t have accepted far less money for the same work that human equivalents would make in all aspects.  So please, reserve your trust for the people who have actually tried to earn it, and don\\'t let a group of people you\\'ve never met put a wedge between you.\\n\\nPeace, love, wags, and purrs,\\n\\nA pissed-off dogtor\\n\\ntl;dr: Chewy is a dishonest trainwreck that doesn\\'t care about you or your pet any more than the other corporate online pharmacies (perhaps even less).\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'m sorry about not replying so long.

It was embarrassing.  \\n>  \\n>I worked in the QA department for a while, but left after they refused to give me a raise, although I was the only person in the department with a degree and the knowledge of small animals,. exotics, and farm to keep the department going. No regrets. Terrible place for a person with an IQ over 35.  \\n>  \\n>Please don\\'t share my name 😊\\n\\nI really appreciated that and just want to say that if this user stuck through all that (including some angry vets and techs and receptionists which I can sometimes be myself) then they\\'ve got the kind of tough our profession needs now more than ever :)\\n\\nSECOND:  Some people have brought up that their vet recommends Chewy or that their vet says they\\'ve never had a problem with them.  This may be true.  I do not know how the company works.  Perhaps its regional, perhaps its random.  But given that there is an employee here saying otherwise and numerous people in veterinary and human medicine confirming that this is a shared experience, I think it\\'s safe to say that this is a widespread problem.  Furthermore, one should keep in mind that Chewy is owned by Petsmart, and Petsmart is in a partnership with Banfield.  I should also say that I don\\'t know the status but I remember a previous attempt of a Banfield merger with Blue Pearl and VCA.  So the point here is that I wouldn\\'t be surprised if some vets aren\\'t allowed to bash Chewy or perhaps get financial incentive to send clients there specifically.   Or perhaps Chewy simply does better dealing with the clinics under their own umbrella.  Or it\\'s nothing but coincidence, I\\'m a vet not a psychic.\\n\\nTHIRD: Yes, they have great customer service when speaking with you.  The point of this post is to discuss what happens to people who aren\\'t the client and what happens to your prescriptions--that your pet needs--behind the scenes.\\n\\nI\\'ll edit more as needed or try to respond better to comments individually but there are a lot more than I anticipated o\\\\_O\\n\\nBasically, just be wary of any company where you\\'ll never be able to chat with the boss (and also be wary of that boss if you can chat with them).  For example, I hear Jeff Bezos is building an actual giant clock that\\'s totally not a doomsday device in the middle of his desert mountain.  Anyways, please be safe, keep 6 feet distance from any of those gross \"other people\", and stay fuzzy, soldiers.\\n\\nEdit 2: I spelled bad :(\\n\\nEdit 3: We\\'ve got another employee.  Thank you very much  PoodlePopXX\\n\\n>As some one who worked for Chewy, they are an actual trash company. They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in.  \\n>  \\n>Just one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances. If you felt awful from the smoke inhalation and air quality you could choose to go home, but you’d have to take attendance points against your record. That’s the kind of company they are.  \\n>  \\n>I ordered from there often before I worked there. After I worked there I wouldn’t order from there if it was free.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it.

Here’s what our boy is on:\\n\\n- Dasequin chews (loading dose then maintence dose). A lot of people swear by supplements like these but we didn’t see much change unfortunately. We’ve stayed on them but not sure it’s been more to him than a very expensive daily delicious treat.\\n\\n- fish oil. He’s been on this for ages for other reasons too so idk how much it’s doing or not but it’s cheap so 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️\\n\\n- Galliprant. It’s expensive but our veterinarian recommended it as the safer option of NSAID to be on and we definitely saw improvement with this. Long term NSAID use has its risks but as long as he keeps doing well and we don’t have a viable replacement he’s going to stay on it, the reduction in pain and inflammation is worth the risk. \\n\\n- Adequan injections. These have helped a lot, it’s a pain to bring him in monthly but they bought us about a year and change of good functionality.  We plan to stay on these for the rest of his life.\\n\\n- our Dr gave us a script of Gabapentin to have on hand for bad days. I recommend tracking your dogs symptoms and days if possible so that you can get an idea of what her triggers are for flare ups to help prevent/get ahead of them, monitor for unexplained changes, etc.\\n\\n- Acupunture. We’ve only JUST started this and jury is still out. Some swear by it, I’m a skeptic but figured it couldn’t hurt. Maybe it’s helping? Maybe it’s placebo? Idk\\n\\n- Cold laser, this can be divisive as well. Same reason for trying as acupuncture, I figured why not give it a whirl. Clinical evidence on efficacy isn’t strong however…\\n\\nWe have been waiting on Librela but we likely will end up trying it fairly soon, as we have noticed some significant progression lately. I’ve been DEEPLY researching Librela for literally months now (not a veterinary professional tho) and here’s where I’m at with it, everyone can take or leave my opinion as they see fit:\\n\\n1. Osteoarthritis is a progressive disease and while yes, Librela doesn’t directly treat the physical nature of it, nothing can truly halt its progression. Some other treatments slow it, but it will progress in all dogs still.\\n\\n2. Librela IS contraindicated for neurological issues, which can sometimes be hard to catch. Anyone considering it should ask their doctor about making sure there aren’t any signs of neurological problems in their dog. There are also risks of urinary issues, again a risk to be weighed.\\n\\n3. There are MANY people with horror stories online about it. I’ve read through plenty. I think it’s important to remember that when we look at self reported adverse effects from this (or any) drug, that these are going to have varying degrees of accuracy, influence of other factors, etc. Some seem to be quite clearly connected (immediate reaction to the injection perhaps indicating an allergy or intolerance, adverse effect that aligns with known issues like neurological or urinary, etc). Others maybe aren’t as clear but show a pattern that we may see a connection with further study down the road. However there have been some I’ve read where I think it’s really a stretch to blame Librela for what happened to their dog, or at the very least there’s no indication that the two are connected in any way.\\n\\nRemember that Librela is being given primarily to elderly dogs. And as anyone who’s had elderly dogs knows, decline or illness can sometimes happen extremely quickly and with little warning ahead of time. Dogs are excellent at hiding pain or may exhibit odd/subtle symptoms we don’t recognize. They may also suddenly go from no symptoms at all to dire very quickly. The same can happen in humans.\\n\\nSo when you have a medication being VASTLY disproportionally given to geriatric dogs, yeah a lot of those dogs are going to pass away suddenly and perhaps not long after simply by chance/something that would’ve happened either way. And when owners are googling Librela and see other horror stories it can be easy to make a connection where perhaps there’s really not evidence for one besides circumstantial. \\n\\nAnd I don’t mean this to sound like I’m flippant or blaming those who end up making such connections. They’re deep in grief, and seeing frenzy online around Librela can often lead them to self blame thinking that THEY may have caused their 15 year old boxers life to be “cut short” when in reality they should be congratulated for caring so well for their boxer that it made it to the IMPRESSIVE age of 15! It makes me sad that I think there’s a lot of people feeling unneeded guilt over trying to do their best to make their dogs last days comfortable. \\n\\nNow ALL of that said, we are still holding off on Librela a bit because our dog has some chronic issues and we were advised by our doctor to wait on it until we were further down the line in regards to his quality of life. We also consulted with his specialists he sees for these issues and they weren’t able to give us clear answers. We are awaiting some information from one of their contacts in Europe, where Liberla has been out and in use substantially longer.\\n\\nBut when we get to the point of it being a question of a degrading of his quality of life that’s outweighing the potential risks… we’re going to try it. I’ve seen enough positive stories to not want to leave it on the table when it could buy him some better quality time (even if it does mean shorter quantity of time, although we made that decision on some other things long ago already).\\n\\nI just encourage everyone to remember that there’s a balance between healthy skepticism of drugs presented as “miracles with no side effects” and healthy skepticism of free-for-alls of horror stories on the internet. This goes for pretty much any medication or treatment tbh… canine or otherwise. The truth is usually somewhere between the two, and finding it means not taking everything at face value (from either side).\\n\\n\\nETA: I almost forgot one of the most important ones! Staying active! Our boy has always been an avid walker since day one, but of course we’ve had to gradually shorten and slow down his routine over the years here. But even some is better than nothing, the very few times he’s had to be cooped up for longer periods (multi day polar vortexes and the like) he got much more stiff after just a day or two of the drastic reduction in physical activity. He’s having a hard time bouncing back from a flare up right now because he lost some muscle mass in his back legs from the week-long reduction in activity (which as they age it can be harder to maintain that muscle I’m sure). Keeping up activity but learning your dogs limits (and signals that she’s nearing her limit, so she doesn’t over do it) will help her stay moving better longer ❤️', 'images': 'https://i.redd.it/7ph2db5tm4jd1.jpeg', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1eu5si4/any_advice_for_dogs_with_arthritis/', 'parent_question': 'any advice for dogs with arthritis! \\nHi!

Anxiety during car rides following crash experience. Within the past year, she had an episode of HGE as well as being diagnosed with dementia, arthritis, and COPD [MEDICAL RECORD IN COMMENTS]\\nClinical signs: (I apologize—I’m unclear on what this means, but I will answer based on my interpretation) excessive unexplained whining, compulsive licking, occasionally confused demeanor, hacking/coughing, a few instances of house soiling, difficulty climbing/descending stairs, noticeably slowed movement. Recently she awoke from deep sleep panting heavily while in a cool room and did not stop for atleast 20 minutes, then proceeded to obsessively lick her paws for over an hour.\\nDuration: the unexplained whining, licking, and general anxiety began about 18 months ago and has progressively become more severe. The breathing/coughing symptoms only developed within the last month or so and improved after a course of antibiotics but are still present.\\nGeneral location: northeast US\\nLinks to relevant info: I am not allowed to post links here, but will in comments\\n\\nThe decline in my best friend’s health began suddenly and worsened rapidly. I am concerned about and seeking a second opinion on several concerns, and would appreciate any advice to promote superior care and comfort for my dog.\\n\\nOver this past year, Bella Jane’s dementia and resulting symptoms have progressively worsened. The vet prescribed trazadone to help her feel more calm and relaxed during anxious times, especially during the evenings. Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics. I am having difficulty differentiating between panting due to anxiety and panting due to breathing issues.\\n\\nThanks so much if you made it this far, and TIA for advice/recommendations!!', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13hp4gc/dog_with_dementiaanxiety/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'My 16 year old chi-mix also has dementia and I\\'ve been watching its progression for about 1-1.25 years now. Now, this is 1-1.25 years from when she really started showing clearer dementia symptoms (starting to whimper for no reason, starting to pace a bit aimlessly, neurological weakness in her hind legs, being unsettled more). However, even before that, the subtle symptoms  began around 2 years ago (age 13-14 or so). Those symptoms are like your Pom\\'s current symptoms. My sweet girl, who used to let us carry her around like a baby in our arms, and who used to be excited to meet every single stranger she came across (when younger she worked as a therapy dog visiting patients in long term elderly care) , started showing aggression to my spouse and I. She would growl when we approached her face for snuggles, occasionally bite us, starting forgetting her tricks (she used to know a ton), stopped wanting to be handled as much yet was still clingy, starting walking past our house and not recognizing it, spent more time by herself etc. It was a change in character that we initially chalked up to old age or slight body pains. At that time, we got her x-rayed, full body examined, blood panel, etc and she had a clean bill of health so we knew her change in demeanor was not due to pain at that moment. But 2 years later, now today, our girl is very deep and clearly into the late stages of dementia. She now walks in circles, gets stuck behind furniture, can no longer solve food puzzles shes had her whole life and used to previously crush with ease, doesnt seek our attention, and seemingly has lost her volition/intent in her actions...shes almost like a passenger in her own body and no longer in control...I\\'ve been accepting that her time with us is coming to end. \\n\\nI wish I had recognized her symptoms earlier, when they first began. It was only about 1 year ago when my vet and I started coming up with a gameplan in terms of supplements/treatment/medication to help slow the dementia down. CCD will 100 percent progress in its severity, but the rate of which may be slowed if you take action. Even so, while we had managed her dementia well for the last 6 months, it still took a sudden turn for the worse this last week, even though we have continued the same program. Its the unfortunate nature of this terrible disease. \\n\\nMy advice for u is to ensure that you are treating all the possible causations that are possibly due to pain (make sure her dental is good, and that she has treatment for arthritis if she has that, have her ears examined for infections etc), and if that doesn\\'t change your dogs demeanor, you should start thinking about dementia as the causation. If your vet is not familiar with CCD, and many are not, change vets. Many vets just think its anxiety, and prescribe meds for those symptoms. I had to find a vet that understood CCD and that would prescribe me Anipryl/Selegeline, which is the only FDA approved drug to treat CCD in dogs. Our girl is also on senilife supplement.  That being said, the most helpful for us has been the introduction of Gabapentin, which both calms her anxiety and helps with pain  If you want a great resource on this topic, considering reading Eileen Anderson\\'s book \"Remember Me.\"  It consolidates a lot of info about dementia in dogs. My vet also provided me with great summary about other potential  drugs/supps that we should try throughout this journey. DM me and I\\'ll forward to you. \\n\\nThe tough part about dogs at this age is that there are often comorbidities. Their vision can be getting worse, there hearing is diminishing, and in turn that also affects their ability to interact with the environment and keep their brain stimulated and strong. My girl got worse as she became more deaf, and more recently her vision has gotten worse which also seems to have made her symptoms worse. She started having more accidents in the house, not only because of her dementia, but also because she started showing signs of kidney disease at age 15.  If you can, try to keep your dog engaged with exercise, training, or some other mental stimulation, to the extent that she is comfortable doing so...studies show that dogs on dementia meds do even better when they have exercise/stimulation. Lastly, please baby proof their environment. Consider putting down yoga mats for traction throughout the house.  As dogs progress in dementia, they started doing wild Sh\\\\*t they never would have done before. My girl who used to train agility, would now face plant jumping off sidewalk curbs because she couldn\\'t judge distance anymore. She also zoomied straight into a wall the other day.  My first dog that had dementia who passed 4 years ago, jumped through the rungs of our 2nd story railing, he survived but it clearly was not good for him.  Lastly, be patient with your pup and yourself and dont be too hard on yourself. Realize that none of the things your dog is doing, is out of spite or within their control, and realize that there will be bumps along the way and that you are doing the best you can to control the things within your reach.

After a few weeks of this, he started to become reactive when I got close to him so I stopped the medication. Luckily, it’s summer and he no longer has dry eyes. \\n\\nIn the past few months, he’s become more and more aggressive towards me, my boyfriend and everyone that he knows. It’s to the point where I can’t even put his leash on without him biting my hands.

He’s friendly with other dogs on the street but barely walks- he’s incredibly slow and has trouble turning corners. I can see his legs shaking but if I pick him up, he’ll bark loudly in my arms and try his best to bite me. \\n\\nAt night, he lays in bed and barks as if someone is there when I’m in the other room. I try to calm him down but he threatens to attack me so I just try to leave him alone. He also stopped letting my boyfriend get near him even though he’s been in his life since he was a puppy. \\n\\nI took him to the vet, he thinks the sudden aggression is to do with pain, arthritis and cognitive decline. He mentioned the main signs of dementia are things like house soiling, pacing, forgetting where his dish his but he doesn’t do any of those things. \\nInstead, he just has a total change of character- more aggressive, reactive, doesn’t want to be touched/looked at. \\n\\nAll of my friends think it’s time to euthanize him because he’s a completely different dog than he was a year ago, but I’m honestly not sure if this is a case of negative conditioning from his past treatment or if he is seriously confused/in pain. \\n\\nIf you could please let me know your thoughts/experiences with senior dogs with CCD I would greatly appreciate it. \\n\\nI don’t want to euthanize a healthy dog that is just upset, but I also don’t want to make him live in pain if that’s the case. \", 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': 'Curious: Do you use aromatherapy on your dog?\\nMy dog\\'s become more territorial and reactive/lunge-y at strangers and dogs over the past week, so we\\'re going back to basics.

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to\\nproduce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.\\n\\nAnxitane\\n-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.\\n-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.\\n\\nValerian Root:\\n-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.\\n-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals. Its central nervous system effects are thought to be associated with an action on the\\ninhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**\\n\\n*No, I have owned a Cane Corso, American Pitbull Terrier and a GSD Mix. All of my dogs were trained in basic obedience (Sit, Stay, Down, Recall, loose lead walking)*\\n\\n**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**\\n\\n*I just lost my Cane Corse to Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and my APBT to bone cancer within a year of each other. They were 10 and 9, respectively. So, I'll be going the reputable breeder route to minimize any health issues moving forward.*\\n\\n**Describe your ideal dog.**\\n\\n*My dream dog is medium - X- Large, minimal-moderate shedding, easily trainable, happy on a hike or in the house for a movie night. They will accompany me almost everywhere, other than work.*\\n\\n**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**\\n\\n*My dream breed is a Dutch Shepherd, they are the most beautiful breed I've ever seen. Unfortunately, my research has built up some fear of not being able to sufficiently meet the breeds physical exercise requirements, (From my understanding, they are like Malinois level energizer bunnies that just go and go) and I've also read that they do not enjoy cuddling after a days work, which is something I absolutely need in a breed lol.*\\n\\n*This has led me to lean towards the GSD breed. I do not particularly like the look of the showline GSD, but their temperament and exercise requirements seem to be exactly what I need. I LOVE the look of the dark sable working line shepherds, with the more square structure and healthier hips / elbows, but I have the same hesitations that come with the Dutch Shepherds regarding the 23.5hrs a day of exercise required to make them happy lol.*\\n\\n*I also feel like the Doberman could be ideal for me, but their breed-specific health issues seem way too common. Kind of scares me, do NOT want another dog to get sick on me.*\\n\\n**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**\\n\\n*Advanced Obedience (Strict heel, down, stay, sit, place, recall, off-lead obedience for hikes), I will be putting a TON of time and energy into the socialization of my pup so he can go to lots of places with me and be comfortable and happy, and, potentially some bite and scent work training that could translate into IPO-style dog sports for fun.*\\n\\n**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**\\n\\n*This is a possibilty down the road when I think he's bored with our normal training routines. I have 0 experience in this field, however.*\\n\\nCare Commitments\\n\\n**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**\\n\\n*I will be doing about 30-60 mins of obedience training, 60-90mins of physcial play, 2-3 walks about 2 miles each, and as much socialization I can each day. At home, my family will be interacting with him nonstop (light play indoors, cuddling, etc.)*\\n\\n**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**\\n\\n*an hour - hour and a half of physical exercise is a realistic number I can hit daily (more on weekends as I go for hikes or walk through state parks on saturday mornings), I also calculate mental and physical exercise as separate activities, so we will also be doing another 30/60 mins of mental exercise via obedience training and puzzles. This includes walks around the neghborhood, playing in our fenced backyard, going to any of the local parks, hiking, etc.*\\n\\n*I will NOT be using a dog park. I have seen way too many untrained dogs at dog parks that just become a danger to have around my pups. my pit was attacked at a dog park, it took me years to make her comfortable around strange dogs again. We will walk through dog parks, but we will not be going into the kennel areas and going off leash for unstructured play with strange dogs.*\\n\\n**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**\\n\\n*I'd prefer a brushing once or twice a week, cleaning ears is fine with me, but I do not want to have to pay a groomer for constant haircuts.*\\n\\nPersonal Preferences\\n\\n**10) What size dog are you looking for?**\\n\\n*Medium to large but Extra Large is also fine with me.*\\n\\n**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**\\n\\n*My Cane Corso slobbered me out, I am now looking for as little drool as I can get while maintaining some of the traits I need. He will be my going everywhere he’s allowed to with me, so slobbering can make people uncomfortable in public or at BBQ's or something lol.*\\n\\n**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**\\n\\n*I would love to be able to keep my dog off-lead whenever it is safe to do so. I'd say very important.*\\n\\nDog Personality and Behavior\\n\\n**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**\\n\\n*I actually love both of these personalities. My APBT was a snuggle bug, while my Cane Corso would get up and go lay across the room after a few minutes of petting. If I had to choose, I'd say I prefer a snuggly dog.*\\n\\n**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**\\n\\n*Eagerness to please is a necessity for my plans with my pup.*\\n\\n**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**\\n\\n*I would prefer for the dog to have guarding instincts, for sure. I have a son who plays in my yard and If a stranger enters my yard, they should know IMMEDIATELY  that they are not welcome. (My Corso was EXCEPTIONAL at this, while my Pit just wanted to love on everyone she saw lol). Knocking on my door -- I'd prefer an alert bark. The dog will be put into a place while I answer the door.*\\n\\n**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**\\n\\n*I hope, with the amount of socialization I'd be working on through puppyhood, that this wouldn't be an issue but, if it was, I would absolutely put the work in to fix this behaviour.*\\n\\n**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**\\n\\n*The way people talk about Huskies just bolting over fences or out of doors because they want to roam seems like an absolute nightmare. Insanely high prey drive is also something I'd like to avoid, as I live in an area that has a LOT of rabbits and small dogs walking around with their owners.*\\n\\nLifestyle\\n\\n**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**\\n\\n*The dog will be alone for 4-6hrs, 2-3 times a week.*\\n\\n**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**\\n\\n*Minimal-Moderate shedding, she will be prepping the dogs meals sometimes and playing / training with him often.*\\n\\n**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**\\n\\n*Unfortunately, no, not anymore.*\\n\\n**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**\\n\\n*Yes, I have a son (2 yrs old) and we spend a lot of time around family members ranging from 3 yrs old to 13 yrs old. I worked with my pit, who would get over excited when she saw my son and I am aware of the rough play risk a dog can pose. I am willing and able to work around this.*\\n\\n**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**\\n\\n*Never renting again.*\\n\\n**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**\\n\\n*I live in PA, USA, North America, Earth. No breed restrictions.*\\n\\n**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**\\n\\n*Peak Summer: \\\\\\\\\\\\~85 F, Peak winter: \\\\\\\\\\\\~30 F*\\n\\nAdditional Information and Questions\\n\\n**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**\\n\\n*I have a 2yr old son, a half acre yard surrounded by 6ft fences. There are many parks around me that are dog friendly.*\\n\\n*I have experience dealing with trouble behaviors (ex. my Cane Corso had crazy resource guarding and food aggression when we first got him).*\\n\\n*I'm looking for a dog that can go on hikes with me, but also chill at family functions for extended periods of time. I also want to be able to train to very high levels of obedience.*\\n\\n**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**\\n\\n*I feel like the working line GSD would require far too much exercise than I could realistically provide, but I have no in-person experience with them.*\\n\\n*Based on my information provided, does any one with working line GSD experience think I could provide the stimulation that would let them live a happy and fulfilled life?*\\n\\n*Is there a breed out there (that isn't a poodle) that actually fits all of the things I'm looking for?*\\n\\nThank you for reading all of this, looking forward to hearing your recommendations!\\n\\nEdit: I removed any misused terms to avoid further issues.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16ip687/another_breed_recommendation_post/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 8, 'content': 'Cost concerns, two dogs needing procedures, not sure what to do, need advice please. \\nI’m in a bit of a predicament between my two dogs. Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

Here\\'s why I hate Chewy. [discussion]\\nNo, it\\'s not the revenue loss.  Pretty much every vet who\\'s not on the brink of retirement age has accepted the loss of the in-clinic pharmacy as an inevitability.  This post also isn\\'t about online pharmacies in general.  I don\\'t necessarily *like* Walmart, or 1-800-PETMEDS, or Allivet.  However, I *hate* Chewy.\\n\\nMy problem is the dishonesty.  You ever get one of those emails or calls where they say your vet hasn\\'t approved the prescription?  Our clients sure did too.  In fact, Chewy accidentally sent us an email recently that was meant for clients:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>Dear Pet Parent,  \\n>  \\n>Chewy is committed to your pet\\'s health and happiness. Challenging times like these will never change that.  \\n>  \\n>We are actively working to contact your veterinarian to get your pet’s prescription approved, so we can deliver your pet’s essential medicine as fast as possible. Unfortunately, we haven\\'t been able to get through as of yet.  \\n>  \\n>These are unprecedented times and it may be possible that your vet is extra busy or working reduced hours. If you’d like to help, you can also contact your veterinarian’s office to find out where they are with approvals.  \\n>  \\n>Your pet\\'s well-being will always be our top priority and we’re doing everything we can to make sure your order goes through.  \\n>  \\n>We appreciate your support. Stay well and find moments of comfort with your pet.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"We\\'re working oh so hard on getting the prescription to you, if only your vet would approve it!\"\\n\\nWhat we found from several of our clients: on numerous occasions (or perhaps all), they were sending this email out the *second* they actually sent the email requesting approval from your vet.  Our clinic always printed out and took care of all approvals by noon the day the prescription requests came in.   Yet, we had always dealt with clients angry about how we weren\\'t approving their scripts.  We would have to send approvals multiple times.  In fact we eventually had to disconnect our fax simply because sending Chewy scripts 3-4 times for each request clogged a free phone line and took up a lot of time.   Chewy tended to be the most egregious of the companies to do this.\\n\\nSo instead we stuck with emails which have convenient time stamps...and the ability to bcc them to the client :)\\n\\nSuddenly, when we started sending these emails to the client with a time stamp from both Chewy\\'s email and our approval, they were calling Chewy instead of us to complain, yelling at customer service when they tried to call the client and claim we weren\\'t approving it, or ditching Chewy altogether.  We got to see both sides ourselves too.  On one fun occasion, we didn\\'t have a medication that our tech needed for her dog but could only order a 1000 count bottle, so she ordered from Chewy.  They didn\\'t respond for about 5 days, then sent the first and only email approval to us at 5pm on a Saturday and then the email to our technician that they were unable to reach us after three attempts at about 7am the following morning.\\n\\nThen the demands came from Chewy for either verbal approval (no paper trail, and no accountability for them), or fax (a paper trail but difficult to send/prove to client, so in most cases, still no accountability for them).  On one occasion we denied both and told them via phone to email three times over the span of an hour, admittedly with some rudeness on the third, and they proceeded to try to send a fax through our phone line consecutively for 35 minutes straight.  I was doing an emergency surgery on a dog with a wound with a bad bleeder from the linguofacial vein while this was happening.  Needless to say, it was hard to concentrate on saving the patient but we couldn\\'t disconnect the phone line in case another urgent call needed to be answered.  The dog did fine (for anyone worrying about this) :).\\n\\nAll of the dishonesty with the timing of approvals have been worse recently.  I suspect related to difficulty with supply in the COVID-19 crisis.  It\\'s been tough for us too, and we\\'ve been honest with clients about this.  So with Chewy, I suspect that instead of saying \"we\\'re having shipping delays\" or \"we\\'re on backorder for that very common thing\", they\\'re simply claiming the vet isn\\'t responding while they deal with delayed arrivals/shipments.\\n\\nSo now they\\'ve stopped doing emails altogether.  They can do fax or verbal approval (again, no accountability), or a new option.  They have an online platform called Petscriptions (again from what their own customer service implied, communication on the timing of prescriptions had no accountability for them, they can say whatever they want).  Furthermore, with yours and our data becoming a more valuable resource, I don\\'t want to make the data mining that every online company does even easier for them.\\n\\nI\\'m not writing this for the revenue.  You\\'ve all heard the \"shop local\" argument so many times I\\'d be beating a dead horse by saying it.  Money is tight, especially now.  And if you wanted to order online to save some money, I encourage you to do so.  I\\'m writing this because Chewy has peddled the idea that they genuinely *care* about your pets, through those occasional oil paintings from someone you and your dog have never met, to the kindhearted condolence texts that, when you read them with an objective eye, seem suspiciously formulaic, to the \"customer is always right\" level of pandering that you and I both know is harmful.  However, the stuff I described above is how they behave when dealing with a vital step in getting your pet the medication they need.  Given that this is one of those steps that you can\\'t see, I think it\\'s telling of how much they *actually* care about your pet.\\n\\nIt shouldn\\'t need to be said that a corporation doesn\\'t care about you or your fur-buddy, but here it is.  I only say this because there *are* people who care about your pet: you, your family, your neighbors (well, sometimes).   And yes, also your doggy daycare workers, your groomers, every worker at your vets office.  If we didn\\'t care about your pet, we wouldn\\'t have accepted far less money for the same work that human equivalents would make in all aspects.  So please, reserve your trust for the people who have actually tried to earn it, and don\\'t let a group of people you\\'ve never met put a wedge between you.\\n\\nPeace, love, wags, and purrs,\\n\\nA pissed-off dogtor\\n\\ntl;dr: Chewy is a dishonest trainwreck that doesn\\'t care about you or your pet any more than the other corporate online pharmacies (perhaps even less).\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'m sorry about not replying so long.  I work half days on Saturday and didn\\'t feel right messing around on Reddit on shift.  A few things to add or discuss since I probably won\\'t be able to reply to everything.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*FIRST AND FOREMOST\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*:  I got a message from a previous Chewy employee who will remain anonymous due to what you can see in the post:\\n\\n>Hey there! I worked for said company mentioned earlier (signed a kind of NDA) and I want you to know that you\\'re right. I worked in customer service for almost a year before moving up, and I have to say that the company is BS. There was no communication between locations, and the longer we went on, the more people straight up ignored any communication without getting reprimanded.  \\n>  \\n>I hated working with vets, although I\\'m studying to be one, and I felt like crap after getting off the phone. Sometimes there would be a case floating around for a week, and no one cared to look at the \"email only\" notes or \"please call after faxing\"... It was embarrassing.  \\n>  \\n>I worked in the QA department for a while, but left after they refused to give me a raise, although I was the only person in the department with a degree and the knowledge of small animals,. exotics, and farm to keep the department going. No regrets. Terrible place for a person with an IQ over 35.  \\n>  \\n>Please don\\'t share my name 😊\\n\\nI really appreciated that and just want to say that if this user stuck through all that (including some angry vets and techs and receptionists which I can sometimes be myself) then they\\'ve got the kind of tough our profession needs now more than ever :)\\n\\nSECOND:  Some people have brought up that their vet recommends Chewy or that their vet says they\\'ve never had a problem with them.  This may be true.  I do not know how the company works.  Perhaps its regional, perhaps its random.  But given that there is an employee here saying otherwise and numerous people in veterinary and human medicine confirming that this is a shared experience, I think it\\'s safe to say that this is a widespread problem.  Furthermore, one should keep in mind that Chewy is owned by Petsmart, and Petsmart is in a partnership with Banfield.  I should also say that I don\\'t know the status but I remember a previous attempt of a Banfield merger with Blue Pearl and VCA.  So the point here is that I wouldn\\'t be surprised if some vets aren\\'t allowed to bash Chewy or perhaps get financial incentive to send clients there specifically.   Or perhaps Chewy simply does better dealing with the clinics under their own umbrella.  Or it\\'s nothing but coincidence, I\\'m a vet not a psychic.\\n\\nTHIRD: Yes, they have great customer service when speaking with you.  The point of this post is to discuss what happens to people who aren\\'t the client and what happens to your prescriptions--that your pet needs--behind the scenes.\\n\\nI\\'ll edit more as needed or try to respond better to comments individually but there are a lot more than I anticipated o\\\\_O\\n\\nBasically, just be wary of any company where you\\'ll never be able to chat with the boss (and also be wary of that boss if you can chat with them).  For example, I hear Jeff Bezos is building an actual giant clock that\\'s totally not a doomsday device in the middle of his desert mountain.  Anyways, please be safe, keep 6 feet distance from any of those gross \"other people\", and stay fuzzy, soldiers.\\n\\nEdit 2: I spelled bad :(\\n\\nEdit 3: We\\'ve got another employee.  Thank you very much  PoodlePopXX\\n\\n>As some one who worked for Chewy, they are an actual trash company. They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in.  \\n>  \\n>Just one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances. If you felt awful from the smoke inhalation and air quality you could choose to go home, but you’d have to take attendance points against your record. That’s the kind of company they are.  \\n>  \\n>I ordered from there often before I worked there. After I worked there I wouldn’t order from there if it was free.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life. It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life.

Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': 'We’ve been dealing with OA for around 2 years now. Here’s what our boy is on:\\n\\n- Dasequin chews (loading dose then maintence dose). A lot of people swear by supplements like these but we didn’t see much change unfortunately. We’ve stayed on them but not sure it’s been more to him than a very expensive daily delicious treat.\\n\\n- fish oil. He’s been on this for ages for other reasons too so idk how much it’s doing or not but it’s cheap so 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️\\n\\n- Galliprant. It’s expensive but our veterinarian recommended it as the safer option of NSAID to be on and we definitely saw improvement with this. Long term NSAID use has its risks but as long as he keeps doing well and we don’t have a viable replacement he’s going to stay on it, the reduction in pain and inflammation is worth the risk. \\n\\n- Adequan injections. These have helped a lot, it’s a pain to bring him in monthly but they bought us about a year and change of good functionality.  We plan to stay on these for the rest of his life.\\n\\n- our Dr gave us a script of Gabapentin to have on hand for bad days. I recommend tracking your dogs symptoms and days if possible so that you can get an idea of what her triggers are for flare ups to help prevent/get ahead of them, monitor for unexplained changes, etc.\\n\\n- Acupunture. We’ve only JUST started this and jury is still out. Some swear by it, I’m a skeptic but figured it couldn’t hurt. Maybe it’s helping? Maybe it’s placebo? Idk\\n\\n- Cold laser, this can be divisive as well. Same reason for trying as acupuncture, I figured why not give it a whirl. Clinical evidence on efficacy isn’t strong however…\\n\\nWe have been waiting on Librela but we likely will end up trying it fairly soon, as we have noticed some significant progression lately. I’ve been DEEPLY researching Librela for literally months now (not a veterinary professional tho) and here’s where I’m at with it, everyone can take or leave my opinion as they see fit:\\n\\n1. Osteoarthritis is a progressive disease and while yes, Librela doesn’t directly treat the physical nature of it, nothing can truly halt its progression. Some other treatments slow it, but it will progress in all dogs still.\\n\\n2. Librela IS contraindicated for neurological issues, which can sometimes be hard to catch. Anyone considering it should ask their doctor about making sure there aren’t any signs of neurological problems in their dog. There are also risks of urinary issues, again a risk to be weighed.\\n\\n3. There are MANY people with horror stories online about it. I’ve read through plenty. I think it’s important to remember that when we look at self reported adverse effects from this (or any) drug, that these are going to have varying degrees of accuracy, influence of other factors, etc. Some seem to be quite clearly connected (immediate reaction to the injection perhaps indicating an allergy or intolerance, adverse effect that aligns with known issues like neurological or urinary, etc). Others maybe aren’t as clear but show a pattern that we may see a connection with further study down the road. However there have been some I’ve read where I think it’s really a stretch to blame Librela for what happened to their dog, or at the very least there’s no indication that the two are connected in any way.\\n\\nRemember that Librela is being given primarily to elderly dogs. And as anyone who’s had elderly dogs knows, decline or illness can sometimes happen extremely quickly and with little warning ahead of time. Dogs are excellent at hiding pain or may exhibit odd/subtle symptoms we don’t recognize. They may also suddenly go from no symptoms at all to dire very quickly. The same can happen in humans.\\n\\nSo when you have a medication being VASTLY disproportionally given to geriatric dogs, yeah a lot of those dogs are going to pass away suddenly and perhaps not long after simply by chance/something that would’ve happened either way. And when owners are googling Librela and see other horror stories it can be easy to make a connection where perhaps there’s really not evidence for one besides circumstantial. \\n\\nAnd I don’t mean this to sound like I’m flippant or blaming those who end up making such connections. They’re deep in grief, and seeing frenzy online around Librela can often lead them to self blame thinking that THEY may have caused their 15 year old boxers life to be “cut short” when in reality they should be congratulated for caring so well for their boxer that it made it to the IMPRESSIVE age of 15! It makes me sad that I think there’s a lot of people feeling unneeded guilt over trying to do their best to make their dogs last days comfortable. \\n\\nNow ALL of that said, we are still holding off on Librela a bit because our dog has some chronic issues and we were advised by our doctor to wait on it until we were further down the line in regards to his quality of life. We also consulted with his specialists he sees for these issues and they weren’t able to give us clear answers. We are awaiting some information from one of their contacts in Europe, where Liberla has been out and in use substantially longer.\\n\\nBut when we get to the point of it being a question of a degrading of his quality of life that’s outweighing the potential risks… we’re going to try it. I’ve seen enough positive stories to not want to leave it on the table when it could buy him some better quality time (even if it does mean shorter quantity of time, although we made that decision on some other things long ago already).\\n\\nI just encourage everyone to remember that there’s a balance between healthy skepticism of drugs presented as “miracles with no side effects” and healthy skepticism of free-for-alls of horror stories on the internet. This goes for pretty much any medication or treatment tbh… canine or otherwise. The truth is usually somewhere between the two, and finding it means not taking everything at face value (from either side).\\n\\n\\nETA: I almost forgot one of the most important ones! Staying active! Our boy has always been an avid walker since day one, but of course we’ve had to gradually shorten and slow down his routine over the years here. But even some is better than nothing, the very few times he’s had to be cooped up for longer periods (multi day polar vortexes and the like) he got much more stiff after just a day or two of the drastic reduction in physical activity. He’s having a hard time bouncing back from a flare up right now because he lost some muscle mass in his back legs from the week-long reduction in activity (which as they age it can be harder to maintain that muscle I’m sure). Keeping up activity but learning your dogs limits (and signals that she’s nearing her limit, so she doesn’t over do it) will help her stay moving better longer ❤️', 'images': 'https://i.redd.it/7ph2db5tm4jd1.jpeg', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1eu5si4/any_advice_for_dogs_with_arthritis/', 'parent_question': 'any advice for dogs with arthritis! \\nHi!

That being said, I could bear without their urine. My oldest has CCD and has started to have accidents every once in a great while, my AMAZING heeler mix developed some mild spay incontinence which paired with her phenobarbital means that she tends to leak urine occasionally & my rescue BC mix is a submissive tinkler after having been abused prior to me adopting her. Not to mention, the puppy is doing great on potty training, but it's called training for a reason haha. I'm starting the search for a carpet scrubber so I can clean my carpets on a monthly basis because I've started to smell urine every once in awhile, even though visitors and my girlfriend can't smell it.\\n\\nTLDR; Looking for the best carpet scrubber for multidog household!\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1dgrz66/carpet_scrubber_dogs/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': 'Is it safe to give my dog an MRI? He has Cushings & Stage 1/2 Kidney Disease.\\nMy dog (12.5YO neutered male Shih Tzu) has been struggling with a low/picky appetite for about a year despite having Cushings Disease. He has Kidney Disease now as well, but his doctors don\\'t think his levels are high enough to account for any GI upset.\\n\\nIn any case, the ravenous appetite that comes with Cushings Disease tends to override any inappetence from Kidney Disease. As a result, his internist suggests doing an MRI to determine if his pituitary tumor progressed into a macroadenoma that\\'s suppressing his hunger.\\n\\nI doubt he\\'d be a good candidate for radiation should they even find a macroadenoma, but I think it would be worthwhile to know. The specialists could also check for any signs of CCD.\\n\\nIf we move forward, the procedure will be done at a major veterinary hospital. It will be overseen by a board-certified anesthesiologist who also serves as the department head. They\\'ll definitely do a modified protocol for his kidneys, but I don\\'t have any specifics yet as to what that will entail.\\n\\nIt\\'s my understanding that the MRI will be about an hour, and they can always \"wrap it up\" sooner if they find what they\\'re looking for. His internist seems more open to him going through a procedure like an MRI, compared to something like a dental cleaning or more invasive surgery.\\n\\nWould you opt for the procedure if it were your dog?

Recently she awoke from deep sleep panting heavily while in a cool room and did not stop for atleast 20 minutes, then proceeded to obsessively lick her paws for over an hour.\\nDuration: the unexplained whining, licking, and general anxiety began about 18 months ago and has progressively become more severe.

I am concerned about and seeking a second opinion on several concerns, and would appreciate any advice to promote superior care and comfort for my dog.\\n\\nOver this past year, Bella Jane’s dementia and resulting symptoms have progressively worsened. The vet prescribed trazadone to help her feel more calm and relaxed during anxious times, especially during the evenings. Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics.

That is a wonderful thing. I have worked in multiple shelters and owned many rescued animals, and I\\'ve seen firsthand how wonderful it is for an abandoned dog to get a forever home. \\n\\nThe downside is that it\\'s contributed to a mass misunderstanding that buying any dog is always equally unethical. Puppy mills and backyard breeders are what cause overpopulation and euthanasia. A reputable breeder breeds infrequently, health tests the parents, typically sells with limited registration and a spay/neuter contract (so the pet dogs aren\\'t then subjected to future backyard breeding), provides thorough vet care and proper socialization, thoroughly screens potential owners, and will take back the dog at any point in its lifetime. They tightly control their lines and take full responsibility for every dog they produce. All the puppies are typically reserved before they\\'re even born. These breeders are not contributing to the shelter population. \\n\\nBut there is so much hatred for ALL breeders that people intentionally avoid them even when they have decided they want a purebred. I have a good friend (a great, well meaning person) who bought a puppy from a guy on a farm whose dog accidentally had puppies because she \"didn\\'t want to buy from a breeder.\" She took this puppy home at six weeks (illegally young to be separated from mom) and she was absolutely riddled with worms because she received no vet care. I\\'m sure the farmer will breed his dog again now that he\\'s seen the kind of demand there is for poodle mixes. \\n\\n Another friend of mine bought a purebred dog off Craigslist because, again, she figured all purchased dogs were equal. This was a brachycephalic breed known for health problems. Parents of course had no health testing. The dog is a health disaster. She hasn\\'t neutered the dog (backyard breeders don\\'t care if you do) and is considering breeding him despite the fact that he is a runt with serious breathing issues and constant inflammation. \\n\\nThe majority of purebred puppies are bought from puppy mills or backyard breeding situations. THIS IS WHERE OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE! We need to continue to encourage shelter adoption but ALSO  uplift good breeders, push for more regulations on breeding (not just banning it), and educate people on how to buy a purebred dog more ethically. \\n\\nThoughts?', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/iq5xcj/discussion_the_downside_of_adopt_dont_shop/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Feeding your dogs once a day, thoughts?\\n A new study that assessed over 10,000 dogs offers some startling insights into the apparent links between feeding frequency and canine health – and the key takeaway is definitely food for thought.\\nAccording to the research, adult dogs that are fed only once per day tend to score significantly better across several indicators of health, compared with dogs that are fed more often.\\n\"Controlling for sex, age, breed, and other potential confounders, we found that dogs fed once daily rather than more frequently had lower mean scores on a cognitive dysfunction scale, and lower odds of having gastrointestinal, dental, orthopedic, kidney/urinary, and liver/pancreas disorders,\" the research team, led by first author and canine health researcher Emily Bray from the University of Arizona, explains in the new paper.\\nThe results are gleaned from data collected by a broad, ongoing canine health study called the Dog Aging Project. \\n\\nFull link: [Link to article](https://www.sciencealert.com/how-often-should-you-feed-your-dog-giant-study-reveals-a-surprising-answer/amp)', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ujurh8/feeding_your_dogs_once_a_day_thoughts/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'My Roxie was diagnosed with CCD last month, so I totally feel you about the difficult nights.

I originally got my dog with an ex but he’s been out of the picture for a while. \\n\\nI just happened to have a couple, less than a week trips to see very good friends of mine coming up in a couple months and feel so torn about leaving her. She has great dog sitters but they don’t stay overnight or anything. I don’t have family around here so I desperately wanted to take these trips for my own mental health. \\n\\nHas anyone else gone through something like this? Any advice you can offer? TIA. Here’s a photo of her, stuffed animals used to prop up her injured leg. She DOES seem to like that.

Anxiety during car rides following crash experience. Within the past year, she had an episode of HGE as well as being diagnosed with dementia, arthritis, and COPD [MEDICAL RECORD IN COMMENTS]\\nClinical signs: (I apologize—I’m unclear on what this means, but I will answer based on my interpretation) excessive unexplained whining, compulsive licking, occasionally confused demeanor, hacking/coughing, a few instances of house soiling, difficulty climbing/descending stairs, noticeably slowed movement. Recently she awoke from deep sleep panting heavily while in a cool room and did not stop for atleast 20 minutes, then proceeded to obsessively lick her paws for over an hour.\\nDuration: the unexplained whining, licking, and general anxiety began about 18 months ago and has progressively become more severe. The breathing/coughing symptoms only developed within the last month or so and improved after a course of antibiotics but are still present.\\nGeneral location: northeast US\\nLinks to relevant info: I am not allowed to post links here, but will in comments\\n\\nThe decline in my best friend’s health began suddenly and worsened rapidly. I am concerned about and seeking a second opinion on several concerns, and would appreciate any advice to promote superior care and comfort for my dog.\\n\\nOver this past year, Bella Jane’s dementia and resulting symptoms have progressively worsened. The vet prescribed trazadone to help her feel more calm and relaxed during anxious times, especially during the evenings. Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics. I am having difficulty differentiating between panting due to anxiety and panting due to breathing issues.\\n\\nThanks so much if you made it this far, and TIA for advice/recommendations!!', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13hp4gc/dog_with_dementiaanxiety/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 8, 'content': '[Discussion] The downside of \"adopt don\\'t shop\"\\nThe upside of the \"adopt don\\'t shop\" movement is that it has led to more dogs being adopted from shelters. That is a wonderful thing. I have worked in multiple shelters and owned many rescued animals, and I\\'ve seen firsthand how wonderful it is for an abandoned dog to get a forever home. \\n\\nThe downside is that it\\'s contributed to a mass misunderstanding that buying any dog is always equally unethical. Puppy mills and backyard breeders are what cause overpopulation and euthanasia. A reputable breeder breeds infrequently, health tests the parents, typically sells with limited registration and a spay/neuter contract (so the pet dogs aren\\'t then subjected to future backyard breeding), provides thorough vet care and proper socialization, thoroughly screens potential owners, and will take back the dog at any point in its lifetime. They tightly control their lines and take full responsibility for every dog they produce. All the puppies are typically reserved before they\\'re even born. These breeders are not contributing to the shelter population. \\n\\nBut there is so much hatred for ALL breeders that people intentionally avoid them even when they have decided they want a purebred. I have a good friend (a great, well meaning person) who bought a puppy from a guy on a farm whose dog accidentally had puppies because she \"didn\\'t want to buy from a breeder.\" She took this puppy home at six weeks (illegally young to be separated from mom) and she was absolutely riddled with worms because she received no vet care. I\\'m sure the farmer will breed his dog again now that he\\'s seen the kind of demand there is for poodle mixes. \\n\\n Another friend of mine bought a purebred dog off Craigslist because, again, she figured all purchased dogs were equal. This was a brachycephalic breed known for health problems. Parents of course had no health testing. The dog is a health disaster. She hasn\\'t neutered the dog (backyard breeders don\\'t care if you do) and is considering breeding him despite the fact that he is a runt with serious breathing issues and constant inflammation. \\n\\nThe majority of purebred puppies are bought from puppy mills or backyard breeding situations. THIS IS WHERE OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE! We need to continue to encourage shelter adoption but ALSO  uplift good breeders, push for more regulations on breeding (not just banning it), and educate people on how to buy a purebred dog more ethically. \\n\\nThoughts?', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/iq5xcj/discussion_the_downside_of_adopt_dont_shop/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Feeding your dogs once a day, thoughts?\\n A new study that assessed over 10,000 dogs offers some startling insights into the apparent links between feeding frequency and canine health – and the key takeaway is definitely food for thought.\\nAccording to the research, adult dogs that are fed only once per day tend to score significantly better across several indicators of health, compared with dogs that are fed more often.\\n\"Controlling for sex, age, breed, and other potential confounders, we found that dogs fed once daily rather than more frequently had lower mean scores on a cognitive dysfunction scale, and lower odds of having gastrointestinal, dental, orthopedic, kidney/urinary, and liver/pancreas disorders,\" the research team, led by first author and canine health researcher Emily Bray from the University of Arizona, explains in the new paper.\\nThe results are gleaned from data collected by a broad, ongoing canine health study called the Dog Aging Project. \\n\\nFull link: [Link to article](https://www.sciencealert.com/how-often-should-you-feed-your-dog-giant-study-reveals-a-surprising-answer/amp)', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ujurh8/feeding_your_dogs_once_a_day_thoughts/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'My Roxie was diagnosed with CCD last month, so I totally feel you about the difficult nights.

Last year he began having focal seizures (mainly head tremors that came with a postictal confusion) and was put on Keppra (I'll have to look up the dosage but that's also 2x a day). Shortly before being prescribed the Keppra, I began to notice that he was falling a lot and when I took video of his gait, we confirmed that his rear legs were crossing especially at turns. Our vet prescribed him a glucosamine and msm supplement in addition to half a carprofen 2x a day for arthritis of the knee, but did confirm that it was likely a progressive neurological issue causing his falling and gait problems. \\n\\nOver the past 4 months or so, he's been having various issues on and off. He has anisocoria that comes and goes where one pupil is unresponsive to light and stays blown, will stay like that for 2-3 days, and then go back to normal. The same eye also swelled/drooped in the upper eyelid at one point, which was diagnosed as allergies after a 10 day Claritin trial, but I wanted to mention it here just in case. Now, he is having incontinence issues. Every other day he's having accidents in his crate, or extreme urgency where he almost can't make it outside when he needs to go. It's formed but soft poo and pee each time. We restrict food and water after 7 and do a 10 letout, and we're up by 8 the next morning (all dogs are crated for safety during the night and when we aren't home, and a few need to be crated and rotated due to repeated conflicts.) He also is only eating about every 3rd day, which he's done in the hot months since he was a puppy, but it's getting colder and his appetite isn't getting better.\\n\\nNow, I know that with progressive neuro diseases  incontinence can signal a decline. However when I do simple neuro tests like paw placement at home, it isn't a severe deficit (there IS a 5 sec delay in righting the paw, but he does do it on his own). I do monthly QOL tests using the Journeys scale and while he's been falling on the scale (6 months ago he was at 38/80, now he's at 27/80), his score isn't so low that I feel the need to rush him in for an emergency end-of-life. He can still be playful, still runs even though he falls and is uncoordinated, and sometimes has a harder time getting up. So I'm having a really hard time deciding what my criteria needs to be for making the decision to euthanize. I don't want to leave him suffering for long (preferably at all), because I saw my mom hold on to her dog past what I'd be comfortable with (he had degenerative myelopathy), and I wouldn't forgive myself if that happened to him. But I also don't want my vet to think that I'm trying to get a convenience euthanasia, especially because he'll be the third dog of our original 7 who we have to say goodbye to. Two of the others were Great Danes, one that we had to let go 2 years ago at 4 yo due to a suspected brain tumor, the other we had to let go last year at 6 yo because she had a ruptured hemangiosarcoma.

Last year he began having focal seizures (mainly head tremors that came with a postictal confusion) and was put on Keppra (I'll have to look up the dosage but that's also 2x a day). Shortly before being prescribed the Keppra, I began to notice that he was falling a lot and when I took video of his gait, we confirmed that his rear legs were crossing especially at turns. Our vet prescribed him a glucosamine and msm supplement in addition to half a carprofen 2x a day for arthritis of the knee, but did confirm that it was likely a progressive neurological issue causing his falling and gait problems. \\n\\nOver the past 4 months or so, he's been having various issues on and off. He has anisocoria that comes and goes where one pupil is unresponsive to light and stays blown, will stay like that for 2-3 days, and then go back to normal. The same eye also swelled/drooped in the upper eyelid at one point, which was diagnosed as allergies after a 10 day Claritin trial, but I wanted to mention it here just in case. Now, he is having incontinence issues. Every other day he's having accidents in his crate, or extreme urgency where he almost can't make it outside when he needs to go. It's formed but soft poo and pee each time. We restrict food and water after 7 and do a 10 letout, and we're up by 8 the next morning (all dogs are crated for safety during the night and when we aren't home, and a few need to be crated and rotated due to repeated conflicts.) He also is only eating about every 3rd day, which he's done in the hot months since he was a puppy, but it's getting colder and his appetite isn't getting better.\\n\\nNow, I know that with progressive neuro diseases  incontinence can signal a decline. However when I do simple neuro tests like paw placement at home, it isn't a severe deficit (there IS a 5 sec delay in righting the paw, but he does do it on his own). I do monthly QOL tests using the Journeys scale and while he's been falling on the scale (6 months ago he was at 38/80, now he's at 27/80), his score isn't so low that I feel the need to rush him in for an emergency end-of-life. He can still be playful, still runs even though he falls and is uncoordinated, and sometimes has a harder time getting up. So I'm having a really hard time deciding what my criteria needs to be for making the decision to euthanize. I don't want to leave him suffering for long (preferably at all), because I saw my mom hold on to her dog past what I'd be comfortable with (he had degenerative myelopathy), and I wouldn't forgive myself if that happened to him. But I also don't want my vet to think that I'm trying to get a convenience euthanasia, especially because he'll be the third dog of our original 7 who we have to say goodbye to. Two of the others were Great Danes, one that we had to let go 2 years ago at 4 yo due to a suspected brain tumor, the other we had to let go last year at 6 yo because she had a ruptured hemangiosarcoma. The third was a 12 yo spaniel mix who was suffering from CCD and arthritis, bith contributing to increasing anxiety and refusal of even the most high value treats despite trying medication for both. Logically, I know that all three of our previous dogs' euthanasias were justified, and with our current pack having two 8yos and two 7yos in addition to a 1yo and a 6 mo, we're llikely going to have to make this decision a lot over the coming 5-10 years. I don't want to look like I don't care about my animals, but I also refuse to let them suffer for my own comfort.\\n\\n\\nQuick stats:\\n8.5 yo neutered male Siberian Husky\\n4 year history with seizures and seizure medications\\nDiagnosed with an unspecified neurodegenerative condition earlier this year\\nCurrently on Phenobarbital, Keppra, Carprofen, and a joint supplement\\nWe are in Massachusetts in the US\\n\\nSymptoms:\\nNew incontinence that comes and goes\\nFalling\\nCrossing legs when walking\\nAnisocoria that comes and goes and has been accompanied by upper eyelid drooping/swelling (suspected allergies)\\nDecreased appetite\\nNormal labs as of 4 months ago\\nVeterinary neuro exams show small deficit in rear paws, home neuro exams concur\\n\\nCurrent QOL score: 27/80 on Journeys, lowest score possible is 8\\n\\nEdit: Lap Of Love score is 15/20\", 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 2, 'content': \"\\nGreetings, all!\\n\\nThis is a sub for professional veterinary advice, and as such we follow strict rules for participating. \\n\\nOP, your post **has NOT** been removed.

But their doctor thinks the pet is good for them to have.\\n\\nI want to preface with my position. I want to get the dog out of his care as soon as possible. I think it\\'s way beyond time and I believe the situation is dire. I think my mother is making it more difficult than it needs to be, though I do understand dealing with dementia patients is difficult. I have posted this scenario in r/dementia and r/alzheimers as well in hopes of all the advice I can possibly get.\\n\\nI previously posted about my grandfather [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/o4ylse/how_do_we_take_the_dogs_away_xpost_from_rdementia/). Things have progressed and I\\'d very much appreciate some insight. My mother is POA and sort of the unofficial caregiver, but does not live with him. He doesn\\'t have any other family members in the area.\\n\\nShortly after that post, one of the dogs was put down. We are unsure exactly what happened, but she was throwing up and apparently miserable. I believe Papa was talking about \"putting her down\" like, \"in the backyard\" if you catch my drift. This was alarming. My mom convinced him to try a medication the vet had suggested.\\n\\nThe short version of the story is that the dogs looked very similar and the wrong dog was getting the medication and therefore the sick dog did not improve and therefore got euthanized by the vet. To say I\\'m horrified about this is an understatement.\\n\\nThe remaining dog (11 year old yellow lab) is overweight, arthritic, currently has a double ear infection, and recently sprained an elbow. Supposedly she fell off the bed. She is 110% not getting medicated for arthritis, nor is she getting the care she needs for her ears, because Papa does not remember to do this. Who knows what else is falling through the cracks.\\n\\nHe loves the dog. But also apparently is starting to forget he has a dog. I guess he asked my mom last night \"where did this dog come from?\". But also still thinks he has two dogs sometimes. His GP and Neurologist seem to think it\\'s good for him to have the dog. Do they know about the state of the dog? I do not know. My mom claims the vet also knows the situation but I really don\\'t think that\\'s true. I honestly get the feeling she\\'s lying to me about that so I don\\'t keep pressuring her to get the dog out of his care faster than she wants.\\n\\nPapa is moving in to an assisted living facility this month. My mom is trying to work in conversations about the dog coming to stay with me/my husband while he moves in and then hopefully he\\'ll just forget about her. My mom is convinced this isn\\'t going to work and Papa will get belligerent. I guess she\\'s brought it up a couple times before and it hasn\\'t gone over well...the general idea of the dog coming to live with me.\\n\\nQuite frankly I don\\'t give a shit if he likes it or not. This dog is suffering and needs to be taken care of and no one is taking care of her. Papa is already forgetting her and how many dogs he does/does not have. I know the doctors think the dog is good for him, but it\\'s not good for HER.\\n\\nWhat can/should I do? Can the vet do something? Should I actually try to get in contact with the vet myself? Please, any advice would be helpful.', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 4, 'content': \"Doglang: An Artificial Language for Dog Commands\\nHi everyone! I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 2, 'content': \"Diet for Canine Cognitive Dysfunction\\nSpecies: Dog\\n\\nAge:15y 3m\\n\\nSex/Neuter status: FS\\n\\nBreed: Border Collie, GSP, Blue Tick, Weimaraner mix\\n\\nBody weight: 60#\\n\\nHistory: Started having seizures 15m ago.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them.

Thanks in advance for your help!\\n\\nWe rescued a ~1 year old great pyrenees and brought her home a week ago. I don't have a super clear picture of her history but she was rescued by a foster person from an unsafe situation, and stayed with the foster in an outdoor kennel for a few weeks before coming to us. Her original owner was older and had dementia and was shooting at his dogs. She is very afraid of people. She has no aggression and we've been told that she loves other dogs. She was transferred to Washington State from Texas on what was undoubtedly a very traumatic long trip in a crate on a bus, we picked her up straight from the bus.\\n\\nShe is paralyzed with fear. She will sit or lay in one spot an entire day. If we pet her she holds totally still and trembles. I have wyze cams recording her overnight, she stays wherever she is all night even while we are sleeping. \\n\\nOur vet originally advised us to never pull her out of there and to let it be her safe space, but when we tried, she stayed in for 24+ hours and our vet recommended that we take her out. I would be fine with her going potty in the house if she was only willing to leave the crate while we're asleep, but she will just hold it. She is not food motivated at all and won't eat most treats even if we leave her with them overnight. She does not like to be looked at or touched. We usually have to carry her outside to go to the bathroom (we try 3x a day but she hates it so much that we only make her do it 2x if she seems very upset).\\n\\nThings we’ve tried:\\n- calm voices/calm household, not bugging her most of the time but petting her and offering her treats (not food AT ALL motivated unfortunately and only eats when we aren't there)\\n- cozy crate, door always open\\n- keeping a radio on so she gets used to voices\\n- gentle bells on the doors and making a routine before we try to take her outside (tell her what we are doing, ring the bells, etc)\\n- pheromone plug in thing\\n- thundershirt \\n- our vet has recommended slowly moving her food farther away from the crate (currently she's only eating in there) and preventing her from going in it sometimes to force her to get used to her surroundings -- we tried this last night and she just didn't eat. \\n\\nFrankly, most of the things we've tried seem like they would only work on a much less scared dog (i.e. tempt her with food, wait for her to come out of her crate on her own)\\n\\nAll of the advice I can find on dogs with fear or anxiety are for dogs much less scared than she is. My main question is: How can I help her overcome her extreme fear? Medication would be really difficult to get in her. Is it bad to pet her gently and talk to her in a gentle voice if she doesn't like it? Should we not pet her or interact with her while she's in her crate? \\n\\nI am also looking for veterinary behaviorists but have been unable to find any in my area (I'm 30 minutes NE of Seattle).

But their doctor thinks the pet is good for them to have.\\n\\nI want to preface with my position. I want to get the dog out of his care as soon as possible. I think it\\'s way beyond time and I believe the situation is dire. I think my mother is making it more difficult than it needs to be, though I do understand dealing with dementia patients is difficult. I have posted this scenario in r/dementia and r/alzheimers as well in hopes of all the advice I can possibly get.\\n\\nI previously posted about my grandfather [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/o4ylse/how_do_we_take_the_dogs_away_xpost_from_rdementia/).

We are unsure exactly what happened, but she was throwing up and apparently miserable. I believe Papa was talking about \"putting her down\" like, \"in the backyard\" if you catch my drift. This was alarming. My mom convinced him to try a medication the vet had suggested.\\n\\nThe short version of the story is that the dogs looked very similar and the wrong dog was getting the medication and therefore the sick dog did not improve and therefore got euthanized by the vet. To say I\\'m horrified about this is an understatement.\\n\\nThe remaining dog (11 year old yellow lab) is overweight, arthritic, currently has a double ear infection, and recently sprained an elbow. Supposedly she fell off the bed. She is 110% not getting medicated for arthritis, nor is she getting the care she needs for her ears, because Papa does not remember to do this. Who knows what else is falling through the cracks.\\n\\nHe loves the dog. But also apparently is starting to forget he has a dog. I guess he asked my mom last night \"where did this dog come from?\". But also still thinks he has two dogs sometimes. His GP and Neurologist seem to think it\\'s good for him to have the dog. Do they know about the state of the dog? I do not know. My mom claims the vet also knows the situation but I really don\\'t think that\\'s true. I honestly get the feeling she\\'s lying to me about that so I don\\'t keep pressuring her to get the dog out of his care faster than she wants.\\n\\nPapa is moving in to an assisted living facility this month. My mom is trying to work in conversations about the dog coming to stay with me/my husband while he moves in and then hopefully he\\'ll just forget about her.

I guess she\\'s brought it up a couple times before and it hasn\\'t gone over well...the general idea of the dog coming to live with me.\\n\\nQuite frankly I don\\'t give a shit if he likes it or not. This dog is suffering and needs to be taken care of and no one is taking care of her. Papa is already forgetting her and how many dogs he does/does not have.

Please, any advice would be helpful.', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 4, 'content': \"Doglang: An Artificial Language for Dog Commands\\nHi everyone! I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands.

I've noticed my dog has started to retaliate. Help!\\nMy MIL with moderate to fairly advanced dementia is staying for us for 10 days.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it.

Thanks in advance for your help!\\n\\nWe rescued a ~1 year old great pyrenees and brought her home a week ago. I don't have a super clear picture of her history but she was rescued by a foster person from an unsafe situation, and stayed with the foster in an outdoor kennel for a few weeks before coming to us. Her original owner was older and had dementia and was shooting at his dogs. She is very afraid of people. She has no aggression and we've been told that she loves other dogs. She was transferred to Washington State from Texas on what was undoubtedly a very traumatic long trip in a crate on a bus, we picked her up straight from the bus.\\n\\nShe is paralyzed with fear. She will sit or lay in one spot an entire day. If we pet her she holds totally still and trembles. I have wyze cams recording her overnight, she stays wherever she is all night even while we are sleeping. \\n\\nOur vet originally advised us to never pull her out of there and to let it be her safe space, but when we tried, she stayed in for 24+ hours and our vet recommended that we take her out. I would be fine with her going potty in the house if she was only willing to leave the crate while we're asleep, but she will just hold it. She is not food motivated at all and won't eat most treats even if we leave her with them overnight. She does not like to be looked at or touched. We usually have to carry her outside to go to the bathroom (we try 3x a day but she hates it so much that we only make her do it 2x if she seems very upset).\\n\\nThings we’ve tried:\\n- calm voices/calm household, not bugging her most of the time but petting her and offering her treats (not food AT ALL motivated unfortunately and only eats when we aren't there)\\n- cozy crate, door always open\\n- keeping a radio on so she gets used to voices\\n- gentle bells on the doors and making a routine before we try to take her outside (tell her what we are doing, ring the bells, etc)\\n- pheromone plug in thing\\n- thundershirt \\n- our vet has recommended slowly moving her food farther away from the crate (currently she's only eating in there) and preventing her from going in it sometimes to force her to get used to her surroundings -- we tried this last night and she just didn't eat. \\n\\nFrankly, most of the things we've tried seem like they would only work on a much less scared dog (i.e. tempt her with food, wait for her to come out of her crate on her own)\\n\\nAll of the advice I can find on dogs with fear or anxiety are for dogs much less scared than she is. My main question is: How can I help her overcome her extreme fear? Medication would be really difficult to get in her. Is it bad to pet her gently and talk to her in a gentle voice if she doesn't like it? Should we not pet her or interact with her while she's in her crate? \\n\\nI am also looking for veterinary behaviorists but have been unable to find any in my area (I'm 30 minutes NE of Seattle). There are some dog trainers, but they seem to be obedience focused and I'm not sure if they would be helpful for our situation.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/13sjnmt/extreme_fear_in_rescue_dog_advice_needed/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}]\n",

I took him to the vet and after a few tests, my boy is suspected to have FIP, renal cancer, or a gnarly kidney infection, but shes leaning more towards renal cancer. I was told that if it's not a kidney infection, the other 2 illnesses that she suspects him to have do not have positive outcomes and very costly and that I should euthanize him.

Im not a doctor, but hearing that his kidneys were normal made me think he either doesnt have cancer or that its early enough to help him through it. So inquired about treating him for FIP until I save for an ultrasound to see if he had cancer (which my job would provide treatment for). She said no, and that treatment will only buy him a few months at best and brought up euthanasia again. So I went on FIP Warriors on FB and got a vial of GS. According to many of them, their cats are still alive many years after the 12 wks of treatment. The day after his first dose it was almost night and day. It could be his antis or it could be the GS treatment, idk, but he's doing better.

Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

The vet has been hesitant to do so the last year or so because of his age. We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. \\n\\nBecause of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath. We tried all sorts of vet recommended supplements/meds to help with the pacing to no avail and now are moving onto an $85 bag of prescription hard dog food said to help with CCD, which I’ll need to soften and likely blend because of his teeth. They don’t make it in a soft food. \\n\\nHe tries to bite me anytime I pick him up to go up/down stairs. So at least twice a day he’s super mad at me. Yet all I want to do it pet his ears and snuggle. It’s been exhausting the last few months. Saying all this makes it sound like he’s miserable. I’m sure sometimes he is but most of the time he still seems to be a happy dog. He does adorable laps around the house when I get home. Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack. One of my favorite things is when he’s eating and his tail does a couple little wags…reminds me of a little kid dancing cause their food is good. \\n\\nI feel really torn on taking on the expense and risk of the dental, assuming he’s clearly for it by the cardiologist. Putting his little body through anesthesia seems like a lot. And as shitty as it feels to say, spending nearly $2000 for a dog at the top of his age expectancy is a lot. The vet and I spent a long time talking recently. The conclusion is there’s no right or wrong answer on how I should proceed, either try to keep him comfortable until it’s time (cause I don’t think we’re at that point yet) or try to be aggressive with treatment. \\n\\nHe’s my little buddy and I hate the feeling that I’m going to pick poorly, that his time is running out, and that he might be in pain.

He is a sweet, gentle giant and we are honoured to be his family. \\n\\nHe has had various health issues since we adopted him at age 7. Despite receiving treatment for arthritis, tie back surgery for laryngeal paralysis/GOLPP, canine cognitive dysfunction, removal of a malignant tumour on his lip, and other ailments, he’s been struggling more recently. He finds it hard to stand and use stairs at times, and gets tired quickly on short walks. He also has spells of confusion and distress at night, panting and pacing for hours, and pants frequently during the day.\\n\\nWe’ve tried medications like metacam, gabapentin, and glucosamine, which he still takes daily, but with debatable improvement. He loves winter due to his thick coat but REALLY struggles in the summer, even with every cooling tip we have tried. Our vet attributes this temperature management issue to laryngeal paralysis.\\n\\nAs warmer weather approaches, I’m really concerned about his comfort. Would it be kinder to consider letting him go before summer, sparing him potential discomfort, or should we wait and see if he can make it to enjoy another winter? I want to honor his life without causing unnecessary suffering, but I’m torn about making this decision too early since he is still eating, drinking, still finds some joy in a short walk and a cuddle on the couch, and still has control over his bowels/bladder.

Until then he will get the help from someone different. \\n\\nTHANK YOU ALL SO MUCH\\n\\nLong story short, my 1 and a 1/2-year-old cat was very sick. I took him to the vet and after a few tests, my boy is suspected to have FIP, renal cancer, or a gnarly kidney infection, but shes leaning more towards renal cancer. I was told that if it's not a kidney infection, the other 2 illnesses that she suspects him to have do not have positive outcomes and very costly and that I should euthanize him. At that moment, I decided to treat it as if he has the infection. \\n\\nShe called me the next day to ask how he was doing on his antis and to tell me thats the results of his urine test was negative for infection and that his kidney functions are normal. Im not a doctor, but hearing that his kidneys were normal made me think he either doesnt have cancer or that its early enough to help him through it. So inquired about treating him for FIP until I save for an ultrasound to see if he had cancer (which my job would provide treatment for). She said no, and that treatment will only buy him a few months at best and brought up euthanasia again. So I went on FIP Warriors on FB and got a vial of GS. According to many of them, their cats are still alive many years after the 12 wks of treatment. The day after his first dose it was almost night and day. It could be his antis or it could be the GS treatment, idk, but he's doing better. Still sluggish, but eating a little more, and not sleeping all day nonetheless\\n\\nI planned to continue buying the FIP treatments online, but at the same time I was hoping she'd prescribe it so his insurance would cover it.  She's been my vet for many years and even the vet for my childhood pets when my mom was alive. She's the kindest most sympathic human being on the planet.

Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

The vet has been hesitant to do so the last year or so because of his age. We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. \\n\\nBecause of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath. We tried all sorts of vet recommended supplements/meds to help with the pacing to no avail and now are moving onto an $85 bag of prescription hard dog food said to help with CCD, which I’ll need to soften and likely blend because of his teeth. They don’t make it in a soft food. \\n\\nHe tries to bite me anytime I pick him up to go up/down stairs. So at least twice a day he’s super mad at me. Yet all I want to do it pet his ears and snuggle. It’s been exhausting the last few months. Saying all this makes it sound like he’s miserable. I’m sure sometimes he is but most of the time he still seems to be a happy dog. He does adorable laps around the house when I get home. Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack. One of my favorite things is when he’s eating and his tail does a couple little wags…reminds me of a little kid dancing cause their food is good. \\n\\nI feel really torn on taking on the expense and risk of the dental, assuming he’s clearly for it by the cardiologist. Putting his little body through anesthesia seems like a lot. And as shitty as it feels to say, spending nearly $2000 for a dog at the top of his age expectancy is a lot. The vet and I spent a long time talking recently. The conclusion is there’s no right or wrong answer on how I should proceed, either try to keep him comfortable until it’s time (cause I don’t think we’re at that point yet) or try to be aggressive with treatment. \\n\\nHe’s my little buddy and I hate the feeling that I’m going to pick poorly, that his time is running out, and that he might be in pain.

I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years.

Recently she awoke from deep sleep panting heavily while in a cool room and did not stop for atleast 20 minutes, then proceeded to obsessively lick her paws for over an hour.\\nDuration: the unexplained whining, licking, and general anxiety began about 18 months ago and has progressively become more severe.

I am concerned about and seeking a second opinion on several concerns, and would appreciate any advice to promote superior care and comfort for my dog.\\n\\nOver this past year, Bella Jane’s dementia and resulting symptoms have progressively worsened. The vet prescribed trazadone to help her feel more calm and relaxed during anxious times, especially during the evenings. Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics. I am having difficulty differentiating between panting due to anxiety and panting due to breathing issues.\\n\\nThanks so much if you made it this far, and TIA for advice/recommendations!!', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/13hp4gc/dog_with_dementiaanxiety/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 10, 'content': '[link] New study confirms significant social and emotional developmental benefits for children under the age of 5 who grow up around dogs: fewer conduct problems, peer problems, total difficulties and increased prosocial behavior\\nThe bond between dogs and children can be remarkably strong. If you need proof just look at the countless viral videos of dogs and babies exhibiting very cute and very real friendships. Having a dog growing up is a quintessential childhood experience for many, and often the staple of tear-jerking dog-centred family films. Now, new research confirms there are significant social and emotional developmental benefits for children under the age of 5 who grow up around dogs.\\n\\nBringing a dog into the home of an already hectic family can seem like an unnecessary, stressful, and often expensive responsibility. However, a new study suggests it might be worth yielding to the demands of pre-school children who want a dog of their own, and it may even help them stand out from their non dog-owning peers.\\n\\nAn investigation into the effect of active play and walking with the family dog in pre-school children found significant differences between children who live with a family dog and those who do not. According to a detailed parental survey, children from dog-owning households had fewer conduct problems, peer problems and fewer total difficulties, while also showing more prosocial behaviour when compared to children without a dog. What’s more, children who played with or walked their dog more often had markedly better prosocial behaviour than those who were less interactive. This study confirms that having a furry friend, even in early childhood, can encourage children to be better behaved, more active and be a ready source of stress relief.\\n\\n[https://www.snippetscience.com/could-a-family-dog-help-your-childs-social-and-emotional-development](https://www.snippetscience.com/could-a-family-dog-help-your-childs-social-and-emotional-development)', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ibbtnk/link_new_study_confirms_significant_social_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 7, 'content': 'She may be starting to show changes in cognitive health, as they typically do start to present around age 11-13, albeit it very subtle. It could also be that her senses are declining (sight/hearing, which also in turn exacerbate the onset of CCD).  My girl did this around age 12-13...became more clingy in the sense that she needed to know she wasn\\'t alone in the house, but she didn\\'t necessarily want us to handle her either (which was off, because she used to LOVE interaction with us). Up until that age, she had no issues being home alone for 8-9 hours a day when we worked. She also stopped sunbathing. Started having separation anxiety again.  She pushed boundaries and started to forget all her previous training/obedience/commands. Unfortunately, I did not realize it was CCD (Canine cognitive dysfunction aka Doggy Dementia) until around age 14.5-15. She is now 16 and deep in the late stages of CCD...her time with us is sunsetting, as her quality of life has declined drastically, even though physically she is closer to a dog that is much younger. I wish I had noticed the changes earlier instead of brushing them off as senior dog quirks.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying your sweet lady will get CCD, but it often starts with very subtle signs that are almost undetectable. If you can afford to do so, I would pre-emptively start a cognitive supportive regiment. Consider adding omega fatty acids to her food (e.g. nordic naturals fish oil, or Welactin). Sam-e is also a supplement that helps with liver function and brain function. Talk to your vet about potentially switching her over to a brain diet (e.g., purina bright minds, or perscription purina pro NC, or Perscription Hill\\'s Science B/D). Consider supplements like senilife, or zesty paws cognitive bites. Most importantly, more than anything money can buy, try to keep her stimulated and engaged mentally and physically...take her out on those walks, let her play with food puzzles, do training sessions with her again...these are all things I wish I did earlier, and unfortunately did not start until she really started showing mental decline. I regret not catching it sooner, and although I don\\'t know how much would have changed if I had, I still make it my effort to educate others now so that they hopefully have an easier time than I did when navigating the uncertainty of CCD .

Loving and Caring for a dog with Canine Cognitive Dysfunction.\"  You can find a lot of her info for free posted on her website [https://dogdementia.com/](https://dogdementia.com/)\\n\\nThis is the 2nd dog I\\'ve had with CCD. The first was my family dog, and I was away for grad school when he really started declining in his mental health, so I missed the bulk of the changes and only saw him later when he was a different dog entirely.  I thought I would notice it better with my current dog, but again, the changes were so subtle that it still snuck up on me. Best of luck. I really don\\'t mean to scare you, but I just want you to be aware of the possibility.

She is still very spry, no problems getting up or down, jumps up and down from things (I try to limit this but she does what she wants sometimes lol) and overall very healthy for her age. However, she seems to be almost reverting back to some puppy behaviors, mainly pushing boundaries and generally a lot more communicative than she used to be. She hates being left outside these days, she use to sunbath and enjoyed being outside a few ours of the day but that’s not the case anymore unless I’m outside with her. She is the first senior dog I’ve ever cared for myself (childhood dog was a senior and passed away when I was away in college so I missed a lot of her behavioral changes as she aged). I’m curious if y’all saw changes like this as your pups aged? I guess just generally more separation anxiety and neediness? I don’t mind adjusting to make sure she’s continuing to be a happy girl just curious about how things will continue to change as she gets older. \\n', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': \"Change in Behavior in Elderly Dog - Dementia? \\nHi all, \\n\\n  \\nMy dog is turning 14 in a few months. I've had her since she was very small, and she is precious to me. In the last 6 months or so, I've noticed some behavioral changes that I don't fully understand. Here are some details:\\n\\n  \\nAround 9 months ago, we brought home a cat, a very active and young Bengal. He frequently teases and upsets the dog, and it's clear his behavior is somewhat stressful to her. \\n\\nPerhaps 2-3 months later, I noticed the dog no longer responding when called, and not listening when I gave her directions. At first I thought this might be stubbornness and obstinance, due to the cat. However, she also stopped waking when I came in the door, and seemed to be less aware when I moved around the room. This lead me to believe she was experiencing hearing loss instead. What was puzzling, was how apparently rapid the onset was. I have also noticed she has basically stopped requesting to play, which had no apparent connection.\\n\\nMaybe 2 months ago, she began drinking more water, and having lots of accidents in the house. I took her to a vet and they reported her physically healthy (they did blood tests and urinalysis) but prescribed a medication we might try for incontinence. 48 hours later and she was in severe discomfort, and having accidents every 5 minutes. I took her back in, and they found she had developed a UTI, the first in her life. After the UTI I took her off the incontinence medication, and found she was still having accidents. I put her back on it, and found no change in behavior.\\n\\nSometime after this I noticed she no longer seems to want to go outside or to the park across the street. This has been something she greatly enjoyed in the past.\\n\\nLately she has been waking up in the middle of the night. I wake up when she does and follow her. She will typically drink for 5-10 minutes, maybe 3-400ml (she's 5kg and this seems like a lot), and then immediately pee on the floor. I have observed she no longer asks to go outside, but she also doesn't pee in her bed or where she's standing. \\n\\nNow, I frequently will let her out pre-emptively. She will typically walk just outside the door, pee on the concrete, turn around and come back inside. In the past she has had a strong preference to pee in grass.\\n\\nI can't figure out the behaviors. Is she incontinent? Is it cognitive decline? Stress? Something else? Why is she not asking to be let out? Why is she drinking so much, with no indicators of a change in physical health? Why is she not asking to play? Can she really not hear, or is she not comprehending? Have we missed something in the health screenings, or is it entirely cognitive?\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1dvhq7k/change_in_behavior_in_elderly_dog_dementia/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 3, 'content': 'Sudden Mystery Behavior Change\\nHi! So our vets are stumps and I figured it might be worth a shot to ask here. My family dog is an almost 7 yo female Great Dane. Around 6 months ago, she started acting like she is constantly hungry. She has started breaking into the trash can for food, jumping onto the counter and stealing food, constantly standing at the cabinet to ask for treats etc. This is never something she has done before, in fact, she really would even beg! \\n\\nThis morning, she ate 4 large blueberry muffins and an entire loaf of sourdough bread that were sitting in the counter wrapped up. She completely tore open the packaging. Another example is when I had 2 boxes of uncooked rice sitting on the floor in a grocery bag and she tore open the cardboard box and tried to start eating it. \\n\\nShe has been to the vet and gotten a bleed test for thyroid, Cushings, and another condition that can cause excessive hunger I don’t remember the name. Every test came back completely normal and healthy except for her liver enzyme which she is now on medication for. However, the vet said this should not cause these symptoms. Does anyone have any ideas on what this might be or what we can test for? \\n\\nOther symptoms such as weight loss can be explained by the liver enzyme, we haven’t noticed anything else out of the ordinary beside an increase in eating grass (typically after she gets into human food though). \\n\\nShe has been on the same brand of food since she graduated from puppy food. I’m waiting for my family to tell me the kibble brand, but she gets it twice a day with fish oil and some chicken in it.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest.

See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation.

I was searching for answers everywhere and could not find anything comprehensive. Even our vet wasn\\'t sure what was happening with our dog or what to suggest. Of course, what works for our dog may not work for everyone but it may give you some hope!\\n\\nWe have a 15 yo lab mix who started having incontinence issues approximately seven months ago. Shortly thereafter she started hanging out in odd places (like under the dining room table in another room when she\\'s usually wherever we are), climbing on furniture (think: standing on top of the dining room table which she had NEVER done before), panting/pacing constantly (would lay down and immediately get back up), climbing into the tub while we were showering and standing under the water (a dog who hates baths), and just would not settle down, day or night. We took her to the vet who suspected separation anxiety.\\n\\nAt first we first tried CBD supplements recommended by our vet which did nothing. We tried another brand of CBD - nothing. We also tried the Thunder Shirt, Thunderwunders, calming music, leaving the tv on, putting something with our scent on her bed...nothing helped. \\n\\nSix months ago we started her on ??mg Prozac (sorry, cannot find the records) and 100mg Trazodone which may have helped a little at first but then did nothing. We were getting frustrated, not sleeping due to her being up all night and were concerned about her quality of life. We\\'d have to put her on a leash just so we could sit down to eat dinner because we feared her climbing/falling off something and injuring herself. We considered it may be the end for her.\\n\\nAfter a lot of research I found out about Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and subsequently Anipryl,  which is apparently the only medicine prescribed specifically for Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. Even our vets were not very familiar with Anipryl, but said they would prescribe it if we wanted to try it. After a daunting withdrawal from the Prozac (we learned after having our vet contact the manufacturer that she needed to be off the Prozac *14 days* before starting the Anipryl; our vet initially suggested 2 days which just shows how little they knew - it could have killed her), we started her on 15 mg Anipryl during the day and switched the Trazodone for .5 mg Alprazolam/5 mg Melatonin at night. **This combination made a world of difference.**\\n\\nNot to be dramatic, but it almost feels like we have our old dog back. She is no longer climbing on furniture, panting/pacing throughout the day. She does have an occasional \"episode\" but they are rare and short lived. She still gets up in the night and will dig in her bed, but she will eventually settle and sleep. We also have her in diapers for the incontinence issue and these have been life-changing as well. THEY WORK. Sometimes we\\'ll double them up (like at night) and put a washable diaper on top so she can\\'t wiggle out of them, but it saves us from having to wash her bed, and it saves our floors & furniture. FWIW she is also on estrogen but it does not prevent her from peeing inside (another thing she\\'d never done before). \\n\\nIt has been about seven months since she started exhibiting symptoms and she is doing so much better now. Aside from the CCD she is in great health; even if it only affords us a few more months with her, we are so happy to have found this protocol that works for us.\\n\\nI just wanted to share in case anyone is having similar issues and is not sure what to do.

The reason this was suggested was because my dog is responding fearfully to precipitation that is NOT making noise, so it may be that he’s responding to an atmospheric condition instead (like a buildup of static electricity, or pressure/humidity change, etc)\\n\\n\\n\\nMy dog's fear of rain/precipitation has gotten so intense, and despite the multitude of things we've tried the only thing that seems to really help him is going outside. It's been suggested that maybe he's grounding himself...is this a real thing that anyone has experience with?? All the studies I've looked at seem to have mixed results or are inconclusive...\\n\\nAnd for some background....my dog is a 12 year old border collie/golden mix in relatively good health for his age. His hearing has gotten pretty bad though, so we're sure that this fear has nothing to do with the sound of rain or thunder (he gets scared with drizzle or even before rain/snow starts).\\n\\nWhen he gets scared of precipitation he paces, shakes, drools excessively, paws/claws at us, and pants, and he'll do all of this for HOURS. He's usually only scared at night (he'll keep us up basically the entire night), and the fear has really only gotten bad since we moved into a new house 2 years ago. When he goes to stay with our in-laws they say his rain fear isn't as bad there...\\n\\nThe fear definitely started as an aversion to the loud noise from fireworks (probably about 4-5 years ago), which then translated to a fear of thunder, which then turned into rain of any sort (even without thunder), and now is any type of precipitation at all OR the general promise of it.\\n\\nAnd the things that we've tried that haven't worked:\\n\\n-Thunder shirt\\n\\n-Comforting him\\n\\n-Ignoring him\\n\\n-Playing with him\\n\\n-Giving him treats or distractions\\n\\n-Calming or loud music\\n\\n-Rubbing dryer sheets on him...(apparently supposed to help with static electricity buildup)\\n\\n-Exercising him extra on days that we know it's supposed to rain at night\\n\\n-Giving him extra nooks/forts/safe spaces/whatever where he can hide while scared\\n\\nThings that sort of work:\\n\\n-His Trazodone prescription....but honestly it takes 2-4 hours for that to kick in, and sometimes it never does. And then he'll be groggy and out of it for the entire next day\\n\\nThe only thing that seems to help:\\n\\n-Going outside into the backyard. He'll come back inside and be good for maybe 20-60 minutes, but then he's right back to being scared afterwards\\n\\nIf buying him a grounding mat for inside our house could be an answer and anyone has any experience with this I'd love to hear about it.

Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics.

If you need proof just look at the countless viral videos of dogs and babies exhibiting very cute and very real friendships. Having a dog growing up is a quintessential childhood experience for many, and often the staple of tear-jerking dog-centred family films. Now, new research confirms there are significant social and emotional developmental benefits for children under the age of 5 who grow up around dogs.\\n\\nBringing a dog into the home of an already hectic family can seem like an unnecessary, stressful, and often expensive responsibility. However, a new study suggests it might be worth yielding to the demands of pre-school children who want a dog of their own, and it may even help them stand out from their non dog-owning peers.\\n\\nAn investigation into the effect of active play and walking with the family dog in pre-school children found significant differences between children who live with a family dog and those who do not. According to a detailed parental survey, children from dog-owning households had fewer conduct problems, peer problems and fewer total difficulties, while also showing more prosocial behaviour when compared to children without a dog. What’s more, children who played with or walked their dog more often had markedly better prosocial behaviour than those who were less interactive. This study confirms that having a furry friend, even in early childhood, can encourage children to be better behaved, more active and be a ready source of stress relief.\\n\\n[https://www.snippetscience.com/could-a-family-dog-help-your-childs-social-and-emotional-development](https://www.snippetscience.com/could-a-family-dog-help-your-childs-social-and-emotional-development)', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ibbtnk/link_new_study_confirms_significant_social_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 7, 'content': 'She may be starting to show changes in cognitive health, as they typically do start to present around age 11-13, albeit it very subtle.

Up until that age, she had no issues being home alone for 8-9 hours a day when we worked. She also stopped sunbathing. Started having separation anxiety again.  She pushed boundaries and started to forget all her previous training/obedience/commands. Unfortunately, I did not realize it was CCD (Canine cognitive dysfunction aka Doggy Dementia) until around age 14.5-15. She is now 16 and deep in the late stages of CCD...her time with us is sunsetting, as her quality of life has declined drastically, even though physically she is closer to a dog that is much younger.

If you can afford to do so, I would pre-emptively start a cognitive supportive regiment. Consider adding omega fatty acids to her food (e.g. nordic naturals fish oil, or Welactin). Sam-e is also a supplement that helps with liver function and brain function. Talk to your vet about potentially switching her over to a brain diet (e.g., purina bright minds, or perscription purina pro NC, or Perscription Hill\\'s Science B/D). Consider supplements like senilife, or zesty paws cognitive bites. Most importantly, more than anything money can buy, try to keep her stimulated and engaged mentally and physically...take her out on those walks, let her play with food puzzles, do training sessions with her again...these are all things I wish I did earlier, and unfortunately did not start until she really started showing mental decline.

I've had her since she was very small, and she is precious to me. In the last 6 months or so, I've noticed some behavioral changes that I don't fully understand. Here are some details:\\n\\n  \\nAround 9 months ago, we brought home a cat, a very active and young Bengal. He frequently teases and upsets the dog, and it's clear his behavior is somewhat stressful to her. \\n\\nPerhaps 2-3 months later, I noticed the dog no longer responding when called, and not listening when I gave her directions. At first I thought this might be stubbornness and obstinance, due to the cat. However, she also stopped waking when I came in the door, and seemed to be less aware when I moved around the room. This lead me to believe she was experiencing hearing loss instead. What was puzzling, was how apparently rapid the onset was. I have also noticed she has basically stopped requesting to play, which had no apparent connection.\\n\\nMaybe 2 months ago, she began drinking more water, and having lots of accidents in the house. I took her to a vet and they reported her physically healthy (they did blood tests and urinalysis) but prescribed a medication we might try for incontinence. 48 hours later and she was in severe discomfort, and having accidents every 5 minutes. I took her back in, and they found she had developed a UTI, the first in her life. After the UTI I took her off the incontinence medication, and found she was still having accidents. I put her back on it, and found no change in behavior.\\n\\nSometime after this I noticed she no longer seems to want to go outside or to the park across the street. This has been something she greatly enjoyed in the past.\\n\\nLately she has been waking up in the middle of the night. I wake up when she does and follow her. She will typically drink for 5-10 minutes, maybe 3-400ml (she's 5kg and this seems like a lot), and then immediately pee on the floor. I have observed she no longer asks to go outside, but she also doesn't pee in her bed or where she's standing. \\n\\nNow, I frequently will let her out pre-emptively. She will typically walk just outside the door, pee on the concrete, turn around and come back inside. In the past she has had a strong preference to pee in grass.\\n\\nI can't figure out the behaviors. Is she incontinent? Is it cognitive decline? Stress? Something else? Why is she not asking to be let out? Why is she drinking so much, with no indicators of a change in physical health? Why is she not asking to play? Can she really not hear, or is she not comprehending?

So our vets are stumps and I figured it might be worth a shot to ask here. My family dog is an almost 7 yo female Great Dane. Around 6 months ago, she started acting like she is constantly hungry.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness. Ultimately, everything was too much for our dog to battle and we had to say goodbye. It\\'s absolutely devastating, and our hearts are still shattered and in pain. We wrote this post with the hope of helping others avoid our mistakes.\\n\\n**If you suspect your dog may be suffering a neurological issue, our recommendation is to see a neurologist.** Whether CCD, a tumor, etc., specialized treatment care is required, and usually beyond what a standard vet can offer. **If your primary vet does not suggest you see a specialist, it is time to find a new vet.** We repeatedly mentioned his persistent restlessness and the lack of sleep everyone was experiencing, but this was never taken seriously. **If your pet is not sleeping throughout the night, please do not suffer through it. Be persistent in finding someone who can empathize and address it.** Many vets just kept offering a boilerplate suggestion, Gabapentin, which immobilized our dog\\'s body but did not calm his overactive brain or allow him any rest. Melatonin did not help at all. After reading many Reddit posts, we wished we would have tried Alprazolam.\\xa0\\n\\nCCD is a difficult diagnosis, yet it is extremely prevalent in older dogs. We highly recommend vigilance in documenting your pet’s symptoms. Keep track of their mood, appetite, mobility, and sleep. But also make sure you also spoil them during this time. Your patience can run thin from the stress of caring for a chronically ill dog - a lack of sleep, frustration at them not eating their medication, etc. Please remember to breathe and to care for them with love. Once they are gone, you don\\'t want to regret being short with them. Their mind is being taken over by something insidious and they have no control over it.\\n\\nHere are some articles that we wish we had found earlier:\\n\\n* [https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf](https://www.natural-necessity.com/doc/research/Alpha-Lipoic-Acid/ALA-Cognitive-Dysfunction-in-a-Dog.pdf)\\n* [https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/](https://burwoodvet.com/dog-dementia-jimmys-story/)\\n* [https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:\\\\~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products](https://www.thepetvet.co.uk/pet-advice/canine-cognitive-dysfunction-doggy-dementia#:~:text=Over%2075%25%20of%20dogs%20with,increased%20removal%20of%20waste%20products).\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* **Be your dog’s best advocate**. As soon as you notice something off in your dog’s behavior, **see a specialist immediately**. Mediocre/chain vet clinics follow a cut/copy/paste/checklist for XYZ symptoms. They often do not have the expertise to make a proper diagnosis or offer the best and latest recommended treatment options. Go to multiple vets, and try to get as many opinions as you possibly can!! If you don’t know where to start you can call an animal hospital and see if the person on the phone can help. We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia.

I was searching for answers everywhere and could not find anything comprehensive. Even our vet wasn\\'t sure what was happening with our dog or what to suggest. Of course, what works for our dog may not work for everyone but it may give you some hope!\\n\\nWe have a 15 yo lab mix who started having incontinence issues approximately seven months ago. Shortly thereafter she started hanging out in odd places (like under the dining room table in another room when she\\'s usually wherever we are), climbing on furniture (think: standing on top of the dining room table which she had NEVER done before), panting/pacing constantly (would lay down and immediately get back up), climbing into the tub while we were showering and standing under the water (a dog who hates baths), and just would not settle down, day or night. We took her to the vet who suspected separation anxiety.\\n\\nAt first we first tried CBD supplements recommended by our vet which did nothing. We tried another brand of CBD - nothing. We also tried the Thunder Shirt, Thunderwunders, calming music, leaving the tv on, putting something with our scent on her bed...nothing helped. \\n\\nSix months ago we started her on ??mg Prozac (sorry, cannot find the records) and 100mg Trazodone which may have helped a little at first but then did nothing. We were getting frustrated, not sleeping due to her being up all night and were concerned about her quality of life. We\\'d have to put her on a leash just so we could sit down to eat dinner because we feared her climbing/falling off something and injuring herself. We considered it may be the end for her.\\n\\nAfter a lot of research I found out about Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and subsequently Anipryl,  which is apparently the only medicine prescribed specifically for Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. Even our vets were not very familiar with Anipryl, but said they would prescribe it if we wanted to try it. After a daunting withdrawal from the Prozac (we learned after having our vet contact the manufacturer that she needed to be off the Prozac *14 days* before starting the Anipryl; our vet initially suggested 2 days which just shows how little they knew - it could have killed her), we started her on 15 mg Anipryl during the day and switched the Trazodone for .5 mg Alprazolam/5 mg Melatonin at night. **This combination made a world of difference.**\\n\\nNot to be dramatic, but it almost feels like we have our old dog back. She is no longer climbing on furniture, panting/pacing throughout the day. She does have an occasional \"episode\" but they are rare and short lived. She still gets up in the night and will dig in her bed, but she will eventually settle and sleep. We also have her in diapers for the incontinence issue and these have been life-changing as well. THEY WORK. Sometimes we\\'ll double them up (like at night) and put a washable diaper on top so she can\\'t wiggle out of them, but it saves us from having to wash her bed, and it saves our floors & furniture. FWIW she is also on estrogen but it does not prevent her from peeing inside (another thing she\\'d never done before). \\n\\nIt has been about seven months since she started exhibiting symptoms and she is doing so much better now. Aside from the CCD she is in great health; even if it only affords us a few more months with her, we are so happy to have found this protocol that works for us.\\n\\nI just wanted to share in case anyone is having similar issues and is not sure what to do. Sadly we had to do most of the research/legwork ourselves because our vets were just not educated about this disease and how to treat it.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/xw9wtx/canine_cognitive_dysfunction_whats_working_for_us/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 9, 'content': \"Does anyone have any experience with their dog grounding themselves to keep calm during rain? \\nEDIT: When I say ”grounding” I’m referring to electrical grounding. Like literally touching the ground or patio outside (or purchasing a mat for inside that claims to have an electrical ground connection) for the purpose of releasing a buildup of static electricity. The reason this was suggested was because my dog is responding fearfully to precipitation that is NOT making noise, so it may be that he’s responding to an atmospheric condition instead (like a buildup of static electricity, or pressure/humidity change, etc)\\n\\n\\n\\nMy dog's fear of rain/precipitation has gotten so intense, and despite the multitude of things we've tried the only thing that seems to really help him is going outside. It's been suggested that maybe he's grounding himself...is this a real thing that anyone has experience with?? All the studies I've looked at seem to have mixed results or are inconclusive...\\n\\nAnd for some background....my dog is a 12 year old border collie/golden mix in relatively good health for his age. His hearing has gotten pretty bad though, so we're sure that this fear has nothing to do with the sound of rain or thunder (he gets scared with drizzle or even before rain/snow starts).\\n\\nWhen he gets scared of precipitation he paces, shakes, drools excessively, paws/claws at us, and pants, and he'll do all of this for HOURS. He's usually only scared at night (he'll keep us up basically the entire night), and the fear has really only gotten bad since we moved into a new house 2 years ago. When he goes to stay with our in-laws they say his rain fear isn't as bad there...\\n\\nThe fear definitely started as an aversion to the loud noise from fireworks (probably about 4-5 years ago), which then translated to a fear of thunder, which then turned into rain of any sort (even without thunder), and now is any type of precipitation at all OR the general promise of it.\\n\\nAnd the things that we've tried that haven't worked:\\n\\n-Thunder shirt\\n\\n-Comforting him\\n\\n-Ignoring him\\n\\n-Playing with him\\n\\n-Giving him treats or distractions\\n\\n-Calming or loud music\\n\\n-Rubbing dryer sheets on him...(apparently supposed to help with static electricity buildup)\\n\\n-Exercising him extra on days that we know it's supposed to rain at night\\n\\n-Giving him extra nooks/forts/safe spaces/whatever where he can hide while scared\\n\\nThings that sort of work:\\n\\n-His Trazodone prescription....but honestly it takes 2-4 hours for that to kick in, and sometimes it never does. And then he'll be groggy and out of it for the entire next day\\n\\nThe only thing that seems to help:\\n\\n-Going outside into the backyard. He'll come back inside and be good for maybe 20-60 minutes, but then he's right back to being scared afterwards\\n\\nIf buying him a grounding mat for inside our house could be an answer and anyone has any experience with this I'd love to hear about it.

Turns out he’s fine, he just had an upset stomach because my grandmother (who has dementia) forgot he ate and kept overfeeding him while I was at work. Why is he having trouble pooping?\\nMy dog Reggie (2yo chihuahua mix, neutered male, 14 lb, baby angel, Philadelphia, snuggle expert) vomited 3 times in 1 hour on Monday night, so we brought him to the pet hospital. He was acting lethargic and shaking so we freaked out. We noticed that we saw pieces of his dog food and treats in his throwup, so we figured he probably didn’t get into the trash or anything.\\n\\nThe vet took Reggie to the back to examine him and said he very clearly has an upset stomach and that there are no signs of obstruction. He asked us how often we fed him and we said twice a day half a cup according to the directions on his kibble. He said that can’t be true if he vomited 3 times and asked if somebody else may have fed him. My mom said she left him with my grandmother for a few minutes while she went to get her car cleaned but instructed her not to feed him, just to play with him and most likely take a nap. The vet advised that we check to see if his kibble bag is emptier than it should be, and in the meantime feed him boiled chicken & rice for a week and hold off on treats to see if he feels better.\\n\\nWhen we got home we noticed that my grandma had taken his kibble bag into her room and just spilled it on the floor and all of his treat bags were empty!! So it turns out she had WAY overfed him. So we called the vet to confirm his suspicion and went with his treatment plan.\\n\\nReggie normally poops twice daily, once after eating in the morning and once after eating in the evening. We all work different hours so he is never alone and goes for walks every 2 hours. Since we started him on chicken and rice (it’s been about 2 days) he has only pooped once. He takes a probiotic with pumpkin twice daily with his food but it doesn’t seem to be helping-I’m wondering if this is normal when dogs are put on this type of diet or if I should be giving him some sort of dog laxative?

I've been working on creating an artificial language specifically designed for our canine friends to understand. After diving down the rabbit hole of phonetics, morphology, psychology, etc. I have finally finished an early version of my doglang and I'm looking for some constructive criticism, advice, resources, etc. to better refine it.\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in the semantic specifics I have posted it [here](https://redd.it/q0z3tw).\\n\\n\\nMy language (or Doglang) is specifically designed to maximize a dog’s ability to understand and distinguish between commands and concepts, while being as easy as possible for English speakers to learn and pronounce. Doglang is inspired by studies that address how dogs hear and understand spoken language. The features of Doglang include being limited to voiced consonants (consonants that require the use of the vocal chords, e.g. b as in **b**est is used, but not it’s voiceless counterpart p as in **p**atio) and long vowels (e.g. thr**ee**, **ei**ght, bl**ue**, etc.), limiting the number of syllables in each command to no more than two syllables, and ensuring that commands remain different sounding enough so as not to be confused with one another.\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the basic commands I have so far (I’ve included a pronunciation table too):\\n\\nSINGLE SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR PUPPIES)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | vaʊ | vow\\nsit | ler | lare\\ndown | gel | gale\\noff (of person) | dev | dayv\\noff (of object) | dez | dayz\\nleave it | daɪz | dize\\nwait | baɪ | by\\n\\nTWO SYLLABLE COMMANDS (FOR ADULT DOGS)\\n\\nCommand | Pronunciation | Spelling\\n:--|:--:|:--:\\nfocus/watch me | raɪz.vaʊ | rizevow\\nsit | el.ler | alelare\\ndown | il.gel | eelgale\\noff (of person) | laɪ.dev | liedayv\\noff (of object) | laɪ.dez | liedayz\\nleave it | laɪg.daɪz | liegdize\\nwait | ger.baɪ | gareby\\n\\nPRONUNCIATION\\n\\nSymbol | Example\\n:--|:--\\nb | **b**est\\nd | **d**ea**d**\\ng | **g**ot\\nl | **l**ean\\nm | **m**other\\nn | **n**eed\\nr | **r**ed\\nv | **v**iolin\\nz | **z**ebra\\naɪ | m**i**ne\\naʊ | c**o**w\\ne | **ei**ght\\ni | thr**ee**\\no | **o**ver\\nu | bl**ue**\\n\\n\\nYou might notice that some of the commands seem to violate the rule that the commands should be different enough so as not to confuse them (i.e., dayv, dayz, diez). My understanding is that in order for a dog to differentiate between two single-syllable commands there must be a difference of at least two phonemes (border collies seem to be an exception). However, in Doglang each letter in each position of a command is determined by the semantic/cognitive primes to maintain consistency in the concepts trying to be conveyed to the dog. Even though dayv (get off of that person) and dayz (get off of that object) will most likely be indistinguishable to a dog, it is not important for them to understand the precise semantics of the commands as they both convey the correction to “get off” (day). As for diez (leave it), dogs tend to have a stronger affinity for vowels than for consonants and will probably be able to recognize the difference between diez and dayz, but in my opinion this is again unimportant as both commands still convey the correction that the dog needs to “move away from the object” (d*z).\\n\\n\\nThe single syllable commands are intended to be used with puppies who have not yet developed the cognitive ability to understand commands beyond the first syllable. As the dog matures they will be able to understand commands that are two syllables. With the two syllable commands the first syllable serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. to get the attention of the dog if their attention is focused elsewhere\\n2. to further differentiate the command from others\\n\\n\\nAt this time I have only completed an initial version of Doglang that only addresses the construction of commands. I will be incorporating more nuances into the language such as tone (to convey emotion and urgency), hand gestures, orientation relative to the dog, and physical contact to further take advantage of how dogs understand humans and communicate with each other.\\n\\n\\nAny feedback that can be provided is greatly appreciated including constructive criticism, recommendations, resources, personal experience, etc.\\n\\nI’m more than happy to answer any questions about the language that I have not already addressed.\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q1a24k/doglang_an_artificial_language_for_dog_commands/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 10, 'content': '[fluff] I adopted a dog yesterday after witnessing a horrific scene.

I’ve tried nearly everything I can to help alleviate some of the problems that I am currently dealing with, and every single solution has turned up nothing. And so, I turn to you, hoping that you might be able to provide an answer. \\n\\nI have a two year old male corgi named Basco, who is honestly my favorite thing on this earth. He is kind, and sweet, and gentle (at least with living things), and he’s made my life feel a lot happier. But, he has had some incredibly serious behavioral issues that I cannot seem to find an explanation for. To be honest, I’m certain that somehow, I’m doing something wrong, but for the life of me, I cannot figure out what it is. I’ll go into detail on everything that has happened down below, but any and all advice you all can provide would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!\\n\\nThe issues started roughly 3 months ago. Basco has had some behavioral problems in the past, but they were mostly related to him not following commands outside of carefully controlled environments (despite lots of work with our trainer), and occasionally chewing on things. He also took nearly a year to be properly house trained. He’s an incredibly smart dog (as most corgis are), but he’s also really stubborn, and if he wants to do or to not do something, it’s his way or the highway. We actually had a previous trainer refer us to somebody else, because we went through several months of her classes and nothing about his behavior changed. His potty training has improved, and is down to around 1-2 accidents per week now, but he is still really stubborn, and lately, he has gotten incredibly destructive.\\n\\nWe recently moved to a new city for a new job of mine, and it’s my first job where I actually have to go into work, as I started work during the pandemic. I made a point to give him alone time during this period, so that way when I would eventually stop working from home, he wouldn’t have separation anxiety. When we moved to our new apartment, things started out fairly decent. However, in the past 3 months, he has cost me nearly a thousand dollars in damages, and now has to be confined to a very small part of my tiled kitchen when I am not home.\\n\\nIn the past 3 months he has destroyed: several wires, all of which should not have been in his reach, and I still to this day do not know how he got them, the legs of my coffee table, an entire couch (yes, the whole thing. It was equally impressive and frustrating. I had to throw out the couch. It was that bad), my bike, which I store indoors, a tv stand, and he has chewed his way through the bottom of my trash can, chewed a hole in my wall, and has annihilated my carpet to the point that I have to pay to re-carpet my entire apartment. He has also chewed and bent the electrical heating units along my baseboards in several places. Not sure what they’re properly called, but it’s the white metal bars that run along the wall near the floor in place of heating by ventilation. He also is not allowed to have dog beds, as he destroys them within minutes, and has even bent the bars of his kennel!\\n\\nAt first, I thought he was just confused or anxious about the new environment. So I made a point about slowly introducing him to new parts of my apartment. I know corgis have a lot of energy, so I make a point of working with him daily to get that out. We go to a doggie day care twice a week in the mornings so he can run and play with other dogs, and the other three days of the week, we either go on walks around my neighborhood or play indoors for at least an hour before I leave for work. (For context, I work 1-9pm, Monday-Friday) I also make sure to do several puzzle toys with him before I leave, and I leave him with a frozen kong of treats and two of those snuffle mat things with hidden treats while I’m at work. I also make sure to leave the tv on, either set to one of those 10 hour doggie TV videos or a long YouTube playlist. I also make time every day before I leave for work to practice commands with him, though if I’m being honest, progress in that department has been pretty poor. We also see a trainer on the weekends, and I make a point about following her directions exactly. \\n\\nBecause of my hours going late, I can’t just leave him at daycare all day, as every daycare within a 50 mile radius of me closes by 6pm, and my hours aren’t really something that I can change due to the nature of my job. The daycare nearest us does allow us to visit for a few hours during the week, (for a fee) which I am highly appreciative of. I’ve also tried using bitter apple sprays as a chew repellant, as well as a vinegar based chew repellant spray that I found online, and neither of these have any effect. I’m honestly convinced my dog doesn’t have taste buds, as neither of these sprays seem to prevent him at all from destroying stuff. Obviously, when I see him engaging in this behavior at home, I make a point of interrupting him, but he doesn’t really seem to learn anything by it, as his behavior there hasn’t changed in the past few months. I also make sure to buy him plenty of new toys to keep his interest, as he pretty much refuses to play with any toy that is more than a week old. \\n\\nHonestly, I’m at a total loss here. My trainer is out of ideas, I’m out of ideas, and as a result, it’s gotten to the point where I have to leave my poor Bosco in a pen, in the middle of my tiled kitchen floor, the entire time I’m at work.

I came home today to find that he had somehow torn up a tile from my floor, meaning that I am now going to have to repair that. I honestly don’t even know how this is possible. I love my dog and truly want to give him the best home possible, and I genuinely want to solve this problem, but I have no clue where to start. So, I ask you, Reddit - what am I doing wrong?

Gus has suddenly developed severe separation anxiety and goes CRAZY when I leave the house--loudly vocalizing, pacing, panting, trying to escape the gated-in kitchen area. It just started about a month ago, and has gotten to such a level that I feel like I can never leave my house. I teach, so my schedule is very laid-back in the summer and more rigorous when school starts (about now). So I HAVE to find some answers. Some quick background on Gus's medical condition:\\n\\n--he has arthritis and was on anti-inflammatories (Metacam, then Deramax) and had back GI issues that led to irritable bowel. He's now off the meds, but to help with the IBS, I also transitioned him from a duck and sweet potato food to a duck grain free food. It's high protein and I'd say he's been on it for a few months. I read that high protein can sometimes cause anxiety. Is this true?\\n\\n--because he can't take NSAIDs for arthritis, he's on 25mg 2x/day of Tramadol for pain. I've read that sometimes Tramadol can negatively effect a dog with canine cognitive disorder, which his litter mate did develop. (the other dog is now on a variety of supplements, which has almost taken the symptoms away). Could a similar thing be happening to Gus? Other meds Gus takes: --Carafate (once at night for GI coating) --1/2 Pepcid with meals (to settle IBS stomach) --25 mgs of Tramadol 2x/day --3mg melatonin (which I thought would help calm him but hasn't)\\n\\nXanax (which I tried, b/c my other dog had it and they're the same age/breed/weight, etc) only made him MORE hyper, but maybe because he was already amped up when I gave it to him. I also tried a Thundershirt (with the suggested gradual training) and it only made his cry a bit quieter. Not really helpful and not something I feel comfortable leaving him in for 6-7 hours.\\n\\nAnd Gus does appear anxious at other times, too, though the anxiety is worst when I leave. But even when I'm making dinner or cleaning (anytime I'm not sitting next to him) he'll stand and cry. After a while he will go lie down, but it takes a while. He cries in the car too, and anytime something happens he doesn't expect. He does get exercise every day--several shorter walks because of his arthritis.\\n\\nSo what can I do!? Medications? I tried behavioral work, but feel like I need something else to go along with those modifications. Should I change foods? Supplements that work? I'm afraid he's going to harm himself or have a heart attack because he's SO anxious and stressed for hours when I'm gone. Plus I feel trapped.\\n\\nThanks in advance for help!\\n\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/2e5cmd/help_for_senior_jack_russell_with_sudden/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 3, 'content': 'Old dog struggles\\nI have a 16 year old dachshund, with some bad teeth, a heart murmur, and canine cognitive dysfunction…it’s been rough. \\n\\nMy pup needs to have some teeth removed. The vet has been hesitant to do so the last year or so because of his age. We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. \\n\\nBecause of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath. We tried all sorts of vet recommended supplements/meds to help with the pacing to no avail and now are moving onto an $85 bag of prescription hard dog food said to help with CCD, which I’ll need to soften and likely blend because of his teeth. They don’t make it in a soft food. \\n\\nHe tries to bite me anytime I pick him up to go up/down stairs. So at least twice a day he’s super mad at me. Yet all I want to do it pet his ears and snuggle. It’s been exhausting the last few months. Saying all this makes it sound like he’s miserable. I’m sure sometimes he is but most of the time he still seems to be a happy dog. He does adorable laps around the house when I get home. Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack. One of my favorite things is when he’s eating and his tail does a couple little wags…reminds me of a little kid dancing cause their food is good. \\n\\nI feel really torn on taking on the expense and risk of the dental, assuming he’s clearly for it by the cardiologist. Putting his little body through anesthesia seems like a lot. And as shitty as it feels to say, spending nearly $2000 for a dog at the top of his age expectancy is a lot. The vet and I spent a long time talking recently. The conclusion is there’s no right or wrong answer on how I should proceed, either try to keep him comfortable until it’s time (cause I don’t think we’re at that point yet) or try to be aggressive with treatment. \\n\\nHe’s my little buddy and I hate the feeling that I’m going to pick poorly, that his time is running out, and that he might be in pain.

Gus has suddenly developed severe separation anxiety and goes CRAZY when I leave the house--loudly vocalizing, pacing, panting, trying to escape the gated-in kitchen area. It just started about a month ago, and has gotten to such a level that I feel like I can never leave my house. I teach, so my schedule is very laid-back in the summer and more rigorous when school starts (about now). So I HAVE to find some answers. Some quick background on Gus's medical condition:\\n\\n--he has arthritis and was on anti-inflammatories (Metacam, then Deramax) and had back GI issues that led to irritable bowel. He's now off the meds, but to help with the IBS, I also transitioned him from a duck and sweet potato food to a duck grain free food. It's high protein and I'd say he's been on it for a few months. I read that high protein can sometimes cause anxiety. Is this true?\\n\\n--because he can't take NSAIDs for arthritis, he's on 25mg 2x/day of Tramadol for pain. I've read that sometimes Tramadol can negatively effect a dog with canine cognitive disorder, which his litter mate did develop. (the other dog is now on a variety of supplements, which has almost taken the symptoms away). Could a similar thing be happening to Gus? Other meds Gus takes: --Carafate (once at night for GI coating) --1/2 Pepcid with meals (to settle IBS stomach) --25 mgs of Tramadol 2x/day --3mg melatonin (which I thought would help calm him but hasn't)\\n\\nXanax (which I tried, b/c my other dog had it and they're the same age/breed/weight, etc) only made him MORE hyper, but maybe because he was already amped up when I gave it to him. I also tried a Thundershirt (with the suggested gradual training) and it only made his cry a bit quieter. Not really helpful and not something I feel comfortable leaving him in for 6-7 hours.\\n\\nAnd Gus does appear anxious at other times, too, though the anxiety is worst when I leave. But even when I'm making dinner or cleaning (anytime I'm not sitting next to him) he'll stand and cry. After a while he will go lie down, but it takes a while. He cries in the car too, and anytime something happens he doesn't expect. He does get exercise every day--several shorter walks because of his arthritis.\\n\\nSo what can I do!? Medications? I tried behavioral work, but feel like I need something else to go along with those modifications. Should I change foods? Supplements that work? I'm afraid he's going to harm himself or have a heart attack because he's SO anxious and stressed for hours when I'm gone. Plus I feel trapped.\\n\\nThanks in advance for help!\\n\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/2e5cmd/help_for_senior_jack_russell_with_sudden/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 3, 'content': 'Old dog struggles\\nI have a 16 year old dachshund, with some bad teeth, a heart murmur, and canine cognitive dysfunction…it’s been rough. \\n\\nMy pup needs to have some teeth removed. The vet has been hesitant to do so the last year or so because of his age. We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. \\n\\nBecause of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath. We tried all sorts of vet recommended supplements/meds to help with the pacing to no avail and now are moving onto an $85 bag of prescription hard dog food said to help with CCD, which I’ll need to soften and likely blend because of his teeth. They don’t make it in a soft food. \\n\\nHe tries to bite me anytime I pick him up to go up/down stairs. So at least twice a day he’s super mad at me. Yet all I want to do it pet his ears and snuggle. It’s been exhausting the last few months. Saying all this makes it sound like he’s miserable. I’m sure sometimes he is but most of the time he still seems to be a happy dog. He does adorable laps around the house when I get home. Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack. One of my favorite things is when he’s eating and his tail does a couple little wags…reminds me of a little kid dancing cause their food is good. \\n\\nI feel really torn on taking on the expense and risk of the dental, assuming he’s clearly for it by the cardiologist. Putting his little body through anesthesia seems like a lot. And as shitty as it feels to say, spending nearly $2000 for a dog at the top of his age expectancy is a lot. The vet and I spent a long time talking recently. The conclusion is there’s no right or wrong answer on how I should proceed, either try to keep him comfortable until it’s time (cause I don’t think we’re at that point yet) or try to be aggressive with treatment. \\n\\nHe’s my little buddy and I hate the feeling that I’m going to pick poorly, that his time is running out, and that he might be in pain.

At the time, I didn’t understand why some vets prescribed medications like Gabapentin and Trazodone for CCD. Many traditional vets, while well-intentioned, seem less familiar with CCD and its management.\\n\\nOur girl's symptoms were severe- spinning in tight circles until she fell over, panting, pacing, and overwhelming anxiety. It was heartbreaking, and we began considering euthanasia. We’d cared for other CCD dogs before, but nothing as intense as this. Desperate for a solution, we consulted a holistic vet, and everything changed.\\n\\nThe holistic vet explained that medications like Gabapentin and Trazodone might actually worsen CCD symptoms, as they’re not designed for this condition. Under her guidance, we stopped those medications and tried CBD oil. Honestly, I wasn’t optimistic, but once we found the right dose and gave it about a week, the results were incredible.\\n\\nThe CBD oil didn’t sedate her- it calmed her and brought back a sense of her former self, before CCD took hold. Her symptoms disappeared, and we finally found relief for her and ourselves.\\n\\nSince then, I’ve joined a few CCD support groups on Facebook (you can easily search for them), and I’ve learned about other helpful supplements like Senilife and Lion’s Mane. Some people also have success with melatonin, though it didn’t work for us.

After months of hesitation I gathered my courage and finally took my beloved 16 yo dog to an MRI scan.

However, the MRI diagnozed her with cognitive disfuction, for which obviously there is no treatment.\\n\\nNow, this diagnosis in itself doesn't come as a shocker given her age. However, the real shocker was the vet saying that this CCD is the main cause of her paralysis, and that there is no need for further investigation about a potential IVDD. After a few hours of grieving (all these months I’d had a glimmer of hope deep inside that her paralysis is treatable), I’ve now decided to do some research on my own about CCD, and, to my surprise, CCD is nowhere given as a potential cause for paralysis.\\n\\nI would like to have some more opinions here on this topic, because I want to fight for my dog till the end. Her quality of life is otherwise good: her blood work looks good, she eats eats normally, she drinks normally, she urinates/defecates normally, no vision loss, no hearing loss. She does sometimes get restless (and I can totally trace this to her dementia), but overall the only big issue is her paralysis. Should I accept that dementia lead to her paralysis and there is no coming back? Or should I request an opinion from another vet?

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to\\nproduce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.\\n\\nAnxitane\\n-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.\\n-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.\\n\\nValerian Root:\\n-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.\\n-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals. Its central nervous system effects are thought to be associated with an action on the\\ninhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet.

He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

At the time, I didn’t understand why some vets prescribed medications like Gabapentin and Trazodone for CCD. Many traditional vets, while well-intentioned, seem less familiar with CCD and its management.\\n\\nOur girl's symptoms were severe- spinning in tight circles until she fell over, panting, pacing, and overwhelming anxiety. It was heartbreaking, and we began considering euthanasia. We’d cared for other CCD dogs before, but nothing as intense as this. Desperate for a solution, we consulted a holistic vet, and everything changed.\\n\\nThe holistic vet explained that medications like Gabapentin and Trazodone might actually worsen CCD symptoms, as they’re not designed for this condition. Under her guidance, we stopped those medications and tried CBD oil. Honestly, I wasn’t optimistic, but once we found the right dose and gave it about a week, the results were incredible.\\n\\nThe CBD oil didn’t sedate her- it calmed her and brought back a sense of her former self, before CCD took hold. Her symptoms disappeared, and we finally found relief for her and ourselves.\\n\\nSince then, I’ve joined a few CCD support groups on Facebook (you can easily search for them), and I’ve learned about other helpful supplements like Senilife and Lion’s Mane.

However, the MRI diagnozed her with cognitive disfuction, for which obviously there is no treatment.\\n\\nNow, this diagnosis in itself doesn't come as a shocker given her age. However, the real shocker was the vet saying that this CCD is the main cause of her paralysis, and that there is no need for further investigation about a potential IVDD. After a few hours of grieving (all these months I’d had a glimmer of hope deep inside that her paralysis is treatable), I’ve now decided to do some research on my own about CCD, and, to my surprise, CCD is nowhere given as a potential cause for paralysis.\\n\\nI would like to have some more opinions here on this topic, because I want to fight for my dog till the end.

She does sometimes get restless (and I can totally trace this to her dementia), but overall the only big issue is her paralysis.

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to\\nproduce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.\\n\\nAnxitane\\n-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.\\n-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.\\n\\nValerian Root:\\n-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.\\n-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals.

Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

Gus has suddenly developed severe separation anxiety and goes CRAZY when I leave the house--loudly vocalizing, pacing, panting, trying to escape the gated-in kitchen area. It just started about a month ago, and has gotten to such a level that I feel like I can never leave my house. I teach, so my schedule is very laid-back in the summer and more rigorous when school starts (about now). So I HAVE to find some answers. Some quick background on Gus's medical condition:\\n\\n--he has arthritis and was on anti-inflammatories (Metacam, then Deramax) and had back GI issues that led to irritable bowel. He's now off the meds, but to help with the IBS, I also transitioned him from a duck and sweet potato food to a duck grain free food. It's high protein and I'd say he's been on it for a few months. I read that high protein can sometimes cause anxiety. Is this true?\\n\\n--because he can't take NSAIDs for arthritis, he's on 25mg 2x/day of Tramadol for pain. I've read that sometimes Tramadol can negatively effect a dog with canine cognitive disorder, which his litter mate did develop. (the other dog is now on a variety of supplements, which has almost taken the symptoms away). Could a similar thing be happening to Gus? Other meds Gus takes: --Carafate (once at night for GI coating) --1/2 Pepcid with meals (to settle IBS stomach) --25 mgs of Tramadol 2x/day --3mg melatonin (which I thought would help calm him but hasn't)\\n\\nXanax (which I tried, b/c my other dog had it and they're the same age/breed/weight, etc) only made him MORE hyper, but maybe because he was already amped up when I gave it to him. I also tried a Thundershirt (with the suggested gradual training) and it only made his cry a bit quieter. Not really helpful and not something I feel comfortable leaving him in for 6-7 hours.\\n\\nAnd Gus does appear anxious at other times, too, though the anxiety is worst when I leave. But even when I'm making dinner or cleaning (anytime I'm not sitting next to him) he'll stand and cry. After a while he will go lie down, but it takes a while. He cries in the car too, and anytime something happens he doesn't expect. He does get exercise every day--several shorter walks because of his arthritis.\\n\\nSo what can I do!? Medications? I tried behavioral work, but feel like I need something else to go along with those modifications. Should I change foods? Supplements that work? I'm afraid he's going to harm himself or have a heart attack because he's SO anxious and stressed for hours when I'm gone.

We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. \\n\\nBecause of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath.

Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack.

She’s 16 and has two big lumps on the bottom part of her stomach, however the vet said compared to what he’s seen, her lumps aren’t that big. He explained to me that even with surgery, the cancer could just reappear in 2-3 months, and the site would be difficult to heal since it’s at the lower part of her stomach, the stitches could risk opening with her just walking. He didn’t do X-rays or any invasive testing to see which tumors are malignant or benign since the cancer being metastatic kinda nulls the need to do that at least from what I understand. He also mentioned with this type of cancer there’s a risk it can travel to the liver and heart which would of course be deadly. \\n\\nShe’s a very energetic and playful dog otherwise, but with her being 16 I wonder if surgery would just delay the inevitable. I’m guessing you guys read a lot of post asking if surgery/treatment for cancer in an elderly dog is worth it, quality vs quality of time etc, and I guess I’m kinda asking the same. Mostly tho I would really like to get the perspective of anyone who’s been through similar and how do you cope with the choice you made, how do you even make a choice? There’s a part of me that wants to throw money at the wall and make sure I did everything I could. But there’s also a part of me that knows that with cancer and her age, I’d just be delaying the inevitable at her expense. I guess I don’t want to miss out on surgery while she’s still energetic and especially don’t want to delay it since she’s already old. But if she’s gonna live those 2-3 months anyway that it would take for the cancer to reappear, maybe it’s better to not do it at all. Hell even the best case scenario of her living 1-2 more years if the cancer doesn’t spread is not enough time for me.\\n\\nI’m just too scared to make a choice and be wrong, how do you get over that fear? Is it even worth getting a second opinion? My vet admitted he’s not a specialist and he could refer me to a hospital vet, but idk if that’s even worth it. While is wish it was otherwise, I also unfortunately don’t have the money to go crazy and take her to any vet and do every treatment either, the surgery the vet recommended was quoted to be at least 900 at that’s already a lot for me. Idk my brain is just a mess right now and I just don’t want any regrets associated with her passing when the time eventually does come.

Gus has suddenly developed severe separation anxiety and goes CRAZY when I leave the house--loudly vocalizing, pacing, panting, trying to escape the gated-in kitchen area. It just started about a month ago, and has gotten to such a level that I feel like I can never leave my house. I teach, so my schedule is very laid-back in the summer and more rigorous when school starts (about now). So I HAVE to find some answers. Some quick background on Gus's medical condition:\\n\\n--he has arthritis and was on anti-inflammatories (Metacam, then Deramax) and had back GI issues that led to irritable bowel. He's now off the meds, but to help with the IBS, I also transitioned him from a duck and sweet potato food to a duck grain free food. It's high protein and I'd say he's been on it for a few months. I read that high protein can sometimes cause anxiety. Is this true?\\n\\n--because he can't take NSAIDs for arthritis, he's on 25mg 2x/day of Tramadol for pain. I've read that sometimes Tramadol can negatively effect a dog with canine cognitive disorder, which his litter mate did develop. (the other dog is now on a variety of supplements, which has almost taken the symptoms away). Could a similar thing be happening to Gus? Other meds Gus takes: --Carafate (once at night for GI coating) --1/2 Pepcid with meals (to settle IBS stomach) --25 mgs of Tramadol 2x/day --3mg melatonin (which I thought would help calm him but hasn't)\\n\\nXanax (which I tried, b/c my other dog had it and they're the same age/breed/weight, etc) only made him MORE hyper, but maybe because he was already amped up when I gave it to him. I also tried a Thundershirt (with the suggested gradual training) and it only made his cry a bit quieter. Not really helpful and not something I feel comfortable leaving him in for 6-7 hours.\\n\\nAnd Gus does appear anxious at other times, too, though the anxiety is worst when I leave. But even when I'm making dinner or cleaning (anytime I'm not sitting next to him) he'll stand and cry. After a while he will go lie down, but it takes a while. He cries in the car too, and anytime something happens he doesn't expect. He does get exercise every day--several shorter walks because of his arthritis.\\n\\nSo what can I do!? Medications? I tried behavioral work, but feel like I need something else to go along with those modifications. Should I change foods? Supplements that work? I'm afraid he's going to harm himself or have a heart attack because he's SO anxious and stressed for hours when I'm gone. Plus I feel trapped.\\n\\nThanks in advance for help!\\n\", 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/2e5cmd/help_for_senior_jack_russell_with_sudden/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': \"Carpet Scrubber & Dogs\\nHello!

The vet has been hesitant to do so the last year or so because of his age. We’ve been keeping running regular courses of antibiotics to help keep any infection at bay and giving pain meds when needed. Even with the antibiotics, he ended up with an abscessed tooth. So we switched meds and that’s clearing up but ultimately doesn’t address the real issue, the teeth just need to be removed. \\n\\nBecause of his age, heart murmur and past experience with a dental(years ago he ended up with aspiration pneumonia after one and nearly died), the vet doesn’t want to even attempt a dental without getting an echocardiogram done. Just for the quote back for that today, $600. If he’s cleared for the dental it’s likely to be another $1200 or so. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, we add in the CCD…doggy dementia. Started with some packing at sunset and has now advanced into getting stuck in corners, accidents in the house, pacing in the middle of the night, and aggression. I get woken up 2-3 times a night by him pacing around. Recently, he pooped in the corner of the bedroom, couldn’t find his way out, and trampled all over his poop. I woke up and tried to pick him up from that spot, he laid down in it because he doesn’t like to be picked up at night anymore. So at 4:30am we’re both pissed while he’s getting a bath. We tried all sorts of vet recommended supplements/meds to help with the pacing to no avail and now are moving onto an $85 bag of prescription hard dog food said to help with CCD, which I’ll need to soften and likely blend because of his teeth. They don’t make it in a soft food. \\n\\nHe tries to bite me anytime I pick him up to go up/down stairs. So at least twice a day he’s super mad at me. Yet all I want to do it pet his ears and snuggle. It’s been exhausting the last few months. Saying all this makes it sound like he’s miserable. I’m sure sometimes he is but most of the time he still seems to be a happy dog. He does adorable laps around the house when I get home. Always excited for a walk or a car trip (although barking/biting happens when it’s time to get out of the car), likes to go to places to sniff all things, likes to greet other dogs, gets excited for a snack. One of my favorite things is when he’s eating and his tail does a couple little wags…reminds me of a little kid dancing cause their food is good. \\n\\nI feel really torn on taking on the expense and risk of the dental, assuming he’s clearly for it by the cardiologist. Putting his little body through anesthesia seems like a lot. And as shitty as it feels to say, spending nearly $2000 for a dog at the top of his age expectancy is a lot. The vet and I spent a long time talking recently. The conclusion is there’s no right or wrong answer on how I should proceed, either try to keep him comfortable until it’s time (cause I don’t think we’re at that point yet) or try to be aggressive with treatment. \\n\\nHe’s my little buddy and I hate the feeling that I’m going to pick poorly, that his time is running out, and that he might be in pain.

She’s 16 and has two big lumps on the bottom part of her stomach, however the vet said compared to what he’s seen, her lumps aren’t that big. He explained to me that even with surgery, the cancer could just reappear in 2-3 months, and the site would be difficult to heal since it’s at the lower part of her stomach, the stitches could risk opening with her just walking. He didn’t do X-rays or any invasive testing to see which tumors are malignant or benign since the cancer being metastatic kinda nulls the need to do that at least from what I understand. He also mentioned with this type of cancer there’s a risk it can travel to the liver and heart which would of course be deadly. \\n\\nShe’s a very energetic and playful dog otherwise, but with her being 16 I wonder if surgery would just delay the inevitable. I’m guessing you guys read a lot of post asking if surgery/treatment for cancer in an elderly dog is worth it, quality vs quality of time etc, and I guess I’m kinda asking the same. Mostly tho I would really like to get the perspective of anyone who’s been through similar and how do you cope with the choice you made, how do you even make a choice? There’s a part of me that wants to throw money at the wall and make sure I did everything I could. But there’s also a part of me that knows that with cancer and her age, I’d just be delaying the inevitable at her expense. I guess I don’t want to miss out on surgery while she’s still energetic and especially don’t want to delay it since she’s already old. But if she’s gonna live those 2-3 months anyway that it would take for the cancer to reappear, maybe it’s better to not do it at all. Hell even the best case scenario of her living 1-2 more years if the cancer doesn’t spread is not enough time for me.\\n\\nI’m just too scared to make a choice and be wrong, how do you get over that fear? Is it even worth getting a second opinion? My vet admitted he’s not a specialist and he could refer me to a hospital vet, but idk if that’s even worth it. While is wish it was otherwise, I also unfortunately don’t have the money to go crazy and take her to any vet and do every treatment either, the surgery the vet recommended was quoted to be at least 900 at that’s already a lot for me. Idk my brain is just a mess right now and I just don’t want any regrets associated with her passing when the time eventually does come. I don’t want that guilt to cloud over her memory, but I also can’t read the future so idk if I’ll ever make a perfect decision. \\n\\nSorry for the word vomit, any advice, tips, personal experiences, recommended supplement, etc. would be highly appreciated. :’)\\n', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': 'My dog has CDD.

The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems.

On a day when our vet wasn't available her symptoms were really scaring us (pacing, barking at the walls, etc) and we took her to an emergency vet. They recommended we put her on a food like Bright Mind, but recommended that we call Purina to speak with a nutritionist to ask if Bright Mind is okay for a dog at high risk for pancreatitis. The nutritionist said they wouldn't give us any recommendations unless we had the vet on the line as well. The issue is our vet got really snarky about the recommendations from the emergency vet when we mentioned them to her, and we're not sure which vet to trust because the ER vet seemed very competent.   \\n\\n\\nSo what I'd really like opinions on is whether it's safe to switch our dog to Bright Mind.

The vet prescribed trazadone to help her feel more calm and relaxed during anxious times, especially during the evenings. Using it seems to either have no effect or to be overly effective, we have not been able to find an effective and helpful dosage. Despite the suspicions of dementia and eventual diagnosis, we were never offered selegeline as a treatment option until I requested it after doing some research. Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system. However, I am concerned about potential serotonin syndrome, which our vet never even mentioned. I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently. I also question the vets conflicting diagnosis of COPD and resulting treatment with antibiotics, mainly because COPD is a chronic condition which are rarely treated with antibiotics.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it. A biopsy/CT would be needed but most signs pointed toward a cancerous tumor.\\n\\nA week later, our dog\\'s balance and mobility were severely impaired. He started to head press constantly in corners and his neck mass doubled in size. That\\'s when we took him to the animal emergency room. It was there that a neurologist diagnosed him with a likely glioma. (It can only be confirmed with an MRI.) We were given Keppra and Ellevet CBD to treat glioma symptoms. However, we were still all struggling with getting sleep at night. Our dog\\'s sleep/wake cycle was completely broken. His \"sundowners\" now turned into full-time restlessness throughout the day. He hardly slept, and the weight loss was becoming more and more pronounced despite hand-feeding every meal. Over the next two weeks, his balance and ability to stand/walk became even more compromised. He lost interest in almost everything he used to enjoy, and couldn’t stop moving or get any sleep from his restlessness.

We weren’t getting any answers from our existing vet and finally found one vet that opened doors and helped figure out next steps. Don’t settle, and time is of the essence so don’t delay. Medications take time to elicit changes.\\n* **With CCD, do NOT get anesthesia. This will rapidly progress their CCD.** If they need dental work, ask instead for antibiotics. Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 6, 'content': 'Our CCD (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) story and things we wish we knew…\\nWe had a wonderful, loving, playful French Bulldog who didn’t have many health issues throughout his life.

Or inquire about less aggressive options.\\n* Start a journal and keep track of daily food intake, medication times, sleep, physical ability (walking, posture), incontinence (going #1 or #2 inside), vomiting, any verbal reactions (crying, whining, incessant barking), and all the things that made them happy (did they get that special thing? See that special person? Play with that favorite toy?), and all the things you did to spoil them.\\n* If your dog doesn’t eat or eats minimally, try to feed smaller meals more frequently.\\n* Even though it may seem impossible, try to keep your dog’s mind active with learning new things. Try treasure hunt games, smelling new things, relearning, and reinforcing old tricks (handshake, high-five, etc).\\n* When you suspect your dog is sick, **start spoiling them** right away. Take them to new places and try to make a ton of new memories. Spoil and feed them their favorite things regularly. You don’t want to wish you did more after they are gone.\\n* You don’t want to have any regrets. Our pets’ lives are so short. You don’t want to regret being frustrated, short, or angry with them. It can be super frustrating if they refuse to eat or spit out their meds, go to the bathroom inside, walk slowly, or don’t sleep. Remember to take a breath and not react to the situation. Maximize all the time you have with them. Don’t spend too much time on Reddit either. Spend the time enjoying your dog and being present for them. It’s an honor to care for them during this stage of their life.\\n* **Have a plan for the end.** We didn’t have a plan for what the last day would look like, and it’s absolutely horrible to have to euthanize them when it feels like a dire emergency. It is horrible for you and especially your dog. Instead, have a plan for a controlled and quiet goodbye. And even if it feels like an emergency, it is best to have a vet confirm the end. We deeply regret and carry enormous guilt for not asking the vet to confirm that we had exhausted all options. We just saw our little guy decline pretty rapidly and asked for euthanasia. We deeply regret not just asking for something to manage the pain while we sorted out the details of saying goodbye. Check out or call the vet clinic(s) (ie. Urgent/Emergency Care, Hospital, Clinic, etc) to learn how they handle euthanasia BEFORE the time comes. We went to urgent care and it was awful. The environment was chaotic and the entire process with someone new was awful. They clearly were not set up to handle euthanasia with any degree of care or tact. Unfortunately, this left us frustrated and traumatized (watching multiple nurses fail to insert his IV line was absolutely brutal), and was exactly the opposite of how we wished to say our final goodbye to the most beautiful soul we’ve ever known.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/seniordogs/comments/1f8j2kx/our_ccd_canine_cognitive_dysfunction_story_and/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}, {'answer_count': 1, 'content': \"Goldendoodle Pup with ongoing health issues - Diarrhea, stunted growth\\nSpecies:dog\\n\\nAge: 8 months \\n\\nSex/Neuter status:male /non-neutered\\n\\nBreed:goldendoodle\\n\\nBody weight: 40 lbs\\n\\nHistory: Our pup, from a trusted breeder, gained weight quickly at first but has since slowed (3 lbs in two months) and appears underweight.

Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety.

Once I mentioned it, the vet did provide us with a prescription with a dosage of 15mg/day, and we were instructed to continue using trazadone as needed for symptom treatment while the selegeline builds up in her system.

I am wondering if I should take her to a different vet and request a different anxiety medication that has fewer risks when used with selegeline. I have already established care with a new veterinary clinic, but we have not yet been able to be seen there due to financial strain. It is a priority though and it will get done urgently.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck.

It wasn’t until around 13.5 years old that we started to notice a change in his behavior. It first started with him waiting by the door during the evenings. We\\'d take him out thinking he needed to go to the bathroom as that had always been his way of telling us that he needed to go outside. However, sometimes he would go to the bathroom and sometimes not, and upon returning he\\'d immediately go back by the door and would just be standing there many times. We were unable to coax him away from the door and get him to rest. Then he started having difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. We went to the vet who suspected CCD and prescribed **20 mg** **Selegiline** (he weighed just under 35 pounds). We also tried name-brand Anipryl initially but didn\\'t see any difference despite the high price. The vet also prescribed **60 mg Galliprant** as he was starting to exhibit weakness in his hips (they would slowly dip when standing and he\\'d start to slowly spin due to hind leg weakness). In addition, we started to top his food with Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet fish oil. Galliprant worked wonders in about \\\\~1-2 weeks. However, his cognition and nighttime sundowners from CCD (restlessness and constant pacing) didn\\'t really improve until 3-4 months of taking Seleligiline. After 3-4 months, we felt like we got our old beautiful dog back. (We were also prescribed **100 mg Gabapentin**. The first time we gave it to him, we all slept for the first time in many nights. However, the neurological effects of Gabapentin are very, very strong. Even the next morning, he would be so out of it. Plus in our case, the beneficial effect was short-lived. We only got one night of solid sleep with Gabapentin. We tried modifying the dose, but the side effects weren\\'t worth it for us, so we stopped giving it to him.)\\n\\nOne year after his initial diagnosis of CCD, we noticed our dog drooling out of one side of his mouth, which was not normal for him. His appetite also started to decline. We got blood work done to make sure nothing serious was going on and everything looked normal. His teeth weren\\'t in great condition, so we thought he may have needed dental work. At this point, he was about 14.5 years old. Because of our concern about him going under at his age, we did blood work twice more to make sure he was healthy enough for anesthesia. This is when we wish someone told us that **anesthesia negatively impacts and** ***accelerates*** **CCD.** If we had known this, we would have opted for antibiotics to treat a possible tooth infection and monitor for improvement. After his dental procedure, our dog had *extreme* **dysphoria**. It took a full 3 days for our guy to recover from the anesthesia. During this time, he was extremely restless but with severely impaired mobility. It was heartbreaking to see him staggering around. We\\'d try to hold him and would lay him in his bed, but he\\'d just get right back up and act like a zombie staggering away aimlessly. He just had to be on his feet. The vet did not offer any support other than suggesting he take Gabapentin, which we already knew did nothing to soothe his anxiety or help him sleep.\\n\\nFinally, he recovered, and we had one beautiful week where everything felt normal again. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The following week he refused to eat anything. We tried everything (yogurt, smoked salmon, pumpkin, chicken, etc), yet he still had a reduced appetite. He started to lose weight rapidly. Two weeks later, we first noticed he started head pressing. This is when your dog presses their head against a wall or object for no apparent reason. We had no clue it indicated a serious neurologic condition. In addition, his posture started to worsen and his head/neck was always hunched lower. Sometimes he would yelp when his neck was touched. We brought him back to the vet who did a quick check and found no explanation. We weren’t provided any answers or cause for concern. Just one week later, we discovered a sizeable firm, fixed lump at the base of his neck. It measured 3x5cm and a fine needle aspiration was performed but did not confirm a diagnosis, which is common with certain cancers. Nor did an x-ray or ultrasound. A ten-day treatment with antibiotics did nothing. We even saw a specialist with decades of experience who had never seen anything like it.

Let me preface by saying I’m a second year vet student at an out of state vet school that does not have a teaching hospital…. I have two dogs that are apparently having a battle over who needs the most expensive medical care when I have pretty much no available funds for it. \\n\\nI have a 6yr old boxer mix that has allergies (food and environmental) that were managed relatively well previously with cytopoint, weekly chlorahexidine baths and Hypoallergenic diet. About 1.5yrs ago we moved further south (from Ontario Canada to Kentucky) and his allergies have been on rage mode since. He’s been on all the drugs and still on a hypo diet and still constantly covered in pustules and rashes. The vet I’ve been taking him to for the last year doesn’t want to prescribe him any more medications unless we do a biopsy with cytology and culture. I understand. It’s unusual that he’s can be on cephalexin and prednisone and cytopoint (he didn’t respond well to apoquel) for months at a time and still have active pustules that don’t resolve. They’ve quoted me $800 to do this procedure. \\n\\nI also have a 12 year old Jack Russell mix that has been a picture of health most of his life. He had a dental done about 3 years ago and had a few teeth removed, mostly incisors and a couple premolars. Back in the summer I realized he has a couple teeth that were looking pretty angry and I believe they were both questionable teeth on his last dental, they looked ok on rads but had a lot of gum recession. After the dental cleaning the gum line came back down and they looked good for a couple years and the gum line only started recessing again a few months ago. I’ve been trying to put money aside for him to have another dental but unfortunately haven’t gotten there because of the vet bills the other dog have been racking up. We’re at a point where he absolutely needs one canine, P3 and P4 removed and the estimate is about $800 for that. Last week in natural Jack Russell fashion he decided he absolutely needed to beat the other dogs that were visiting for the holidays to the kitchen and wiped out coming down the stairs. He has been non-weight bearing on his hind left leg since.  I suppose it’s important to note that he is not overweight, actually I’d probably put him at a 4/9 BCS. He is non painful on palpation but does have a positive drawer test. He’s had some crepitus in his joints over the last couple years, I mean he’s 12, but never displayed any signs of joint discomfort and has been taking Dasuquin for the last year. As evidenced by his mad dash down the stairs, he has not even experienced “slowing down” in his senior years. Even with the left leg non-weight bearing he’s been running around the house and up and down the stairs as a tripod as if he’s always been a tripod, that’s not even slowing him down. \\n\\nSo here’s the problem, I have $1200 to my name right now, and a monthly income of about $400 for food, gas, everyday expenses, etc which doesn’t equate to a net gain. I have one dog that needs treatment for allergies that the local vet won’t continue prescribing without doing the biopsy for $800. I have another dog that really really does need an $800 dental procedure, and now also probably needs a TPLO or something. How do I proceed with this situation? What is more pressing? I can’t even ask the vets to give me their opinion because the dogs have seen two different vets that aren’t familiar with the others case. I have tried to find a lower cost clinic and I’ve also tried to find a loan (I dont qualify for care credit or anything) with no luck. How am I supposed to choose which dog gets medical treatment especially when it could be months before I can afford the other? \\n\\nPlease I’d appreciate any opinions about what to do in this scenario because I don’t know and feel like a terrible person for literally being a vet student and not being able to provide care for my own two dogs. \\n\\nFor reference, I’ve uploaded photos of the skin condition on one dog and the dental situation on the other. \\n\\nSkin: https://imgur.com/a/1BSMgw8\\n*this is while taking cephalexin, prednisone, cytopoint injections and on a strict Hypo diet, regularly takes nexgaurd plus. He has another spot like this in his inguinal area and under his chin because those are the places hes found ways to scratch even if he’s wearing a cone, onesie, booties, etc. he also has interdigital cysts that are worse with the booties but without the booties the spot on his chin is worse so… \\n\\nDental: https://imgur.com/a/CYI3peE\\n*Canine, P3 and P4 on upper left have got to go (and possibly more) I know it shouldn’t be this bad but I’ve been trying to budget for this dental for months and just haven’t had the money. \\n\\nIf we’re talking “quality of life”, the allergy situation on the boxer is the most disheartening to deal with, he will literally chew his own skin off if left to his own devices while the other dog seems to be carrying on his merry way with severe dental disease and a CCR but maybe he’s just better at hiding it. \\n\\nI don’t know, please help, I don’t know what to do.

At the time, I didn’t understand why some vets prescribed medications like Gabapentin and Trazodone for CCD. Many traditional vets, while well-intentioned, seem less familiar with CCD and its management.\\n\\nOur girl's symptoms were severe- spinning in tight circles until she fell over, panting, pacing, and overwhelming anxiety. It was heartbreaking, and we began considering euthanasia. We’d cared for other CCD dogs before, but nothing as intense as this. Desperate for a solution, we consulted a holistic vet, and everything changed.\\n\\nThe holistic vet explained that medications like Gabapentin and Trazodone might actually worsen CCD symptoms, as they’re not designed for this condition. Under her guidance, we stopped those medications and tried CBD oil. Honestly, I wasn’t optimistic, but once we found the right dose and gave it about a week, the results were incredible.\\n\\nThe CBD oil didn’t sedate her- it calmed her and brought back a sense of her former self, before CCD took hold. Her symptoms disappeared, and we finally found relief for her and ourselves.\\n\\nSince then, I’ve joined a few CCD support groups on Facebook (you can easily search for them), and I’ve learned about other helpful supplements like Senilife and Lion’s Mane. Some people also have success with melatonin, though it didn’t work for us. For our girl, CBD oil was nothing short of a miracle.\\n\\nIf you’re dealing with CCD, I strongly recommend consulting a holistic vet.

We’ve been going to a different vet since 2021 when we relocated across the US. \\n\\nApril 2024: routine annual exam, labs were all normal and I agreed to several vaccines reluctantly, aside from the mandatory rabies vaccine. \\n\\nI Increased CBD dosage to about 34mg/2x day because I thought she would benefit as she was getting slower I think. I can’t remember but I had a good reason for it. \\n\\nAugust 2024: noticed a hanging growth under her tongue (video above). Went to our vet on 8/5 who recommended surgery to remove it in case it’s a malignant tumor that’s missing pigment, I forgot the medical term. We stopped all supplements including the CBD in preparation for the surgery. \\n\\n8/7/2024 night: She threw up her breakfast a couple of hours after giving a piece of banana. We didn’t fast her since it was 12 hours since eating breakfast and gave her dinner not long after. After dinner, she got 1/2 of an Oravet dental chew but seemingly chewed in two halves before swallowing. \\n\\nShe threw up several more times into the following morning which included her undigested meal and both halves of the Oravet chew. We fasted her for 16 hours occasionally giving only coconut water (no sugar added)  until we finally decided to feed her due to her lethargy. Fed a little pureed boiled chicken breast and white rice every few hours. We noticed she had a fever that crept up to 104.7 overnight Friday 8/9 into Saturday so we applied a cold compress to her feet and ears, while she wore her cooling vest. We brought the fever down to 103.5 during the night and 102.4 right before going to the vet. \\n\\nWhen we went to the vet the following morning (Saturday 8/10), we told the vet everything including the fact that she was now eating. He recommended postponing the surgery. We requested labs that showed ALT 16x higher than in April and slightly low WBC. Pictures of the last two sets of labs above - April labs were sent out, and August labs were done in-house. She also lost two lbs since April because of the vomiting?\\n\\nThe vet prescribed Enrofloxacin 204mg flex tabs  - 1/2 tablet twice daily for ten days and a supplement for her liver called Denamarin 225 mg S-Adenosylmethionine* and 82 mg Silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (SPC)' (SAMe) two tablets daily on an empty stomach one-hour minimum before food. \\n\\nHer temperature was 102.6 at the the vet and it's now 101.6 after two doses of antibiotics. She is showing signs of improvement when she’s awake however she is still tired and is sleeping a lot today, only a little more than she usually does. I can see her face is still tired. \\n\\nAlso, it’s probably worth mentioning that she had an emergency stomach exploratory surgery two years ago because she ate a sanitary pad. She recovered well and she has not eaten anything foreign since then. \\n\\n\\nMy wife suggested we don’t do the surgery at all since it’s taking her quite some time to bounce back and we don’t know how the anesthesia will affect her considering her age.  We believe he cares about his patients even though he doesn’t seem to absorb all the details we tell him until we reiterate it.

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to\\nproduce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.\\n\\nAnxitane\\n-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.\\n-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.\\n\\nValerian Root:\\n-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.\\n-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals. Its central nervous system effects are thought to be associated with an action on the\\ninhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

At the time, I didn’t understand why some vets prescribed medications like Gabapentin and Trazodone for CCD. Many traditional vets, while well-intentioned, seem less familiar with CCD and its management.\\n\\nOur girl's symptoms were severe- spinning in tight circles until she fell over, panting, pacing, and overwhelming anxiety. It was heartbreaking, and we began considering euthanasia. We’d cared for other CCD dogs before, but nothing as intense as this. Desperate for a solution, we consulted a holistic vet, and everything changed.\\n\\nThe holistic vet explained that medications like Gabapentin and Trazodone might actually worsen CCD symptoms, as they’re not designed for this condition. Under her guidance, we stopped those medications and tried CBD oil. Honestly, I wasn’t optimistic, but once we found the right dose and gave it about a week, the results were incredible.\\n\\nThe CBD oil didn’t sedate her- it calmed her and brought back a sense of her former self, before CCD took hold.

I can’t remember but I had a good reason for it. \\n\\nAugust 2024: noticed a hanging growth under her tongue (video above). Went to our vet on 8/5 who recommended surgery to remove it in case it’s a malignant tumor that’s missing pigment, I forgot the medical term. We stopped all supplements including the CBD in preparation for the surgery. \\n\\n8/7/2024 night: She threw up her breakfast a couple of hours after giving a piece of banana. We didn’t fast her since it was 12 hours since eating breakfast and gave her dinner not long after. After dinner, she got 1/2 of an Oravet dental chew but seemingly chewed in two halves before swallowing. \\n\\nShe threw up several more times into the following morning which included her undigested meal and both halves of the Oravet chew. We fasted her for 16 hours occasionally giving only coconut water (no sugar added)  until we finally decided to feed her due to her lethargy. Fed a little pureed boiled chicken breast and white rice every few hours. We noticed she had a fever that crept up to 104.7 overnight Friday 8/9 into Saturday so we applied a cold compress to her feet and ears, while she wore her cooling vest. We brought the fever down to 103.5 during the night and 102.4 right before going to the vet. \\n\\nWhen we went to the vet the following morning (Saturday 8/10), we told the vet everything including the fact that she was now eating. He recommended postponing the surgery. We requested labs that showed ALT 16x higher than in April and slightly low WBC. Pictures of the last two sets of labs above - April labs were sent out, and August labs were done in-house. She also lost two lbs since April because of the vomiting?\\n\\nThe vet prescribed Enrofloxacin 204mg flex tabs  - 1/2 tablet twice daily for ten days and a supplement for her liver called Denamarin 225 mg S-Adenosylmethionine* and 82 mg Silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (SPC)' (SAMe) two tablets daily on an empty stomach one-hour minimum before food. \\n\\nHer temperature was 102.6 at the the vet and it's now 101.6 after two doses of antibiotics. She is showing signs of improvement when she’s awake however she is still tired and is sleeping a lot today, only a little more than she usually does. I can see her face is still tired. \\n\\nAlso, it’s probably worth mentioning that she had an emergency stomach exploratory surgery two years ago because she ate a sanitary pad. She recovered well and she has not eaten anything foreign since then. \\n\\n\\nMy wife suggested we don’t do the surgery at all since it’s taking her quite some time to bounce back and we don’t know how the anesthesia will affect her considering her age.  We believe he cares about his patients even though he doesn’t seem to absorb all the details we tell him until we reiterate it.

Collar\\n-Is a synthetic copy of the natural canine appeasing pheromone proven to help support dogs in a range of stressful situations. The ‘appeasing pheromone’ is naturally released by all lactating mammals to comfort and reassure their offspring. In dogs, the canine appeasing pheromone has not only been shown to help puppies, but also to have a comforting influence on adults\\ndogs helping them to be more resilient and cope appropriately with change. D.A.P is canine specific, odorless, non-sedative, non-systemic and can be used alongside all other types of\\nmedication.\\n-The efficacy of DAP has been demonstrated in 18 studies published in scientific journals and at veterinary conferences around the world.\\n-For adult dogs - DAP has also been shown to help dogs cope in kennels during rehoming and in a range of other stressful situations such as during firework exposure, car travel, and for\\nseparation distress.\\n\\nChillout - Aromatherapy for Pets\\n-A powerful blend of chamomile, lavender and sweet marjoram act to calm and quiet pet nervousness. The applications for this mist are never ending: hyperactivity, separation anxiety, sleeplessness, thunderstorms, destructive nervousness, vet visits, nighttime pacing, etc.\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nBach Flower Essences- Rescue Remedy\\n-Rescue Remedy can be used for an immediate calming effect in any stressful situation, or when your pet needs help overcoming a variety of emotional or behavioral problems. Rescue Remedy can help your pet with: visits to the vet, fear of loud noises, excessive barking, shock, trauma or mistreatment, loss of companion, separation anxiety, adapting to new surroundings\\n\\nThrough A Dog’s Ear - www.throughadogsear.com\\n-The nine compositions of Music to Calm Your Canine Companion, Vol. 1 have been clinically tested to calm dogs, and in many cases, reduce anxiety. The instrumentation is simple — solo piano. The individual pieces have been selected and/or rearranged to gradually reduce the heart rate. This is accomplished naturally by progressively slowing rhythms and simplifying auditory data.\\n-Recommended Use: for when you want your dog to rest, when your dog is left alone, or when anxiety or excitement in your dog is anticipated — thunderstorms, fireworks, or the arrival of\\nguests.\\n\\nEssential Oil: Young Living Lavender Oil - www.youngliving.com\\n-Spray on collar, bed, or thundershirt\\n\\nComposure\\n-According to the manufacturer, Composure™ helps to alleviate stress-related behavioral issues without affecting the dog’s energy levels or personality.\\n-It contains three main ingredients to support calming in dogs: C3™ colostrum calming complex, l-theanine and thiamine. The colostrum calming complex is isolated from bioactive colostrum proteins, found to support cognitive function and stress reduction. L-theanine\\nsupports calming, relaxation, reduced irritability and low mood states. A naturally occurring amino acid, l-theanine is a derivative of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid that helps to\\nproduce other calming amino acids like dopamine and GABA.\\n\\nAnxitane\\n-Pure L-Theanine, an amino acid that acts to reduce fear and anxiety.\\n-This product requires at least 30 days of use to see signs of behavior change.\\n\\nValerian Root:\\n-Valerian officinalis is the botanical name of the plant from which valerian root extract is prepared. V. officinalis (valerian) has been used in traditional medicines as a sedative for 2000 years and continues to be used today.\\n-There is little doubt that it does have sedative/calming properties both in humans and domestic animals. Its central nervous system effects are thought to be associated with an action on the\\ninhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Valerian is also said to have antispasmodic properties.', 'images': '', 'link': 'https://reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/3nb8nu/curious_do_you_use_aromatherapy_on_your_dog/', 'source': 'facebook', 'type': 'social_qa'}]\n",
